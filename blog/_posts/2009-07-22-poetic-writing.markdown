excerpt: A funny passage I came across while doing research for my PhD thesis.

Technical writing in 1974 was a lot more poetic than it is now.  From F. Downton's discussion of Stone's "Cross-Validatory Choice and Assessment of Statistical Predictions":

> A current nine-day wonder in the press concerns the exploits of a Mr. Uri
> Geller who appears to be able to bend metal objects without touching them;
> Professor Stone seems to be attempting to bend statistics without touching
> them. My attitude to both of these phenomena is one of open-minded 
> scepticism; I do not believe in either of these prestigious activities, on 
> the other hand they both deserve serious scientific examination.

Also enjoyable is Stone's extended analogy:

> \[I\]t is reasonable to enquire how one arrives at a prescription in any
> particular problem.  A tentative answer is that, like a doctor with his
> patient, the statistician with his client must write his prescription only
> after careful consideration of the reasonable choices... Just as the
> doctor should be prepared for side-effects, so the statistician should
> monitor and check the execution of the prescription for any unexpected
> complications... A prescription is neither true nor false; it is better
> to say that, in a broad sense, it either succeeds or fails.

You just don't see this kind of writing very often in current Statistics 
writing.
