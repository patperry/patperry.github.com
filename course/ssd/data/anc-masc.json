We are in chambers, and this is \nthe matter of Kitzmiller, of course, versus Dover Area School \nDistrict. We have assembled as planned with respect to the issue of \ncertain subpoenas that have been issued to reporters Joseph Maldonado \nand Heidi Bernhard-Bubb.\n\nPresent in chambers are counsel for both the plaintiffs and the \ndefendants, and in addition to that, let me ask that you enter your \nappearances specially, presumably as counsel for the individuals we \nreferred to in our orders collectively as \"reporters.\"\n\n\n\n    I'm here, Niles Benn, on behalf of both of the reporters, \nHeidi Bernard-Bubb and Joseph Maldonado. And with me is Terance Barna,\nan attorney in my office, as well.\n\n\n\n    All right. Now, previously, on September 12th, the Court \nentered an order which went to the motion for reconsideration. That \nrelated specifically to -- filed by the reporters. That went \nspecifically to our August 2nd order which, in effect, said that the \nreporters would have to testify at certain depositions. Subsequently, \nthe reporters were, if memory serves, approximately eight days ago, \nsubpoenaed to testify by the plaintiffs in the case-in-chief. Yet \nanother motion to quash or for alternative relief was filed by the \nreporters through Mr. Benn's office. By our order of last Thursday \n-- the date escapes me, I think it was Thursday -- the Court denied \nrelief in that matter. The Court was advised that yesterday, on \nSeptember the 27th, the reporters, both of them, showed up at the \nappointed times for their depositions as appropriately scheduled by the\ndefendants, and I'm advised -- and I'll correct this if I'm wrong \n-- that both reporters cited the reporter's privilege that they consider\nto exist under the First Amendment so that they would not answer \nany questions at those depositions. We're brought here today by that, \nas well as the fact that I presume you're here because the reporters\nhave been properly subpoenaed to appear in the plaintiffs' \ncase-in-chief. Now, have I mischaracterized anything from your \nstandpoint? \n\n\n\n    No, everything that you said is correct, Your \nHonor. \n\n\n\n    Now, the most salient question then is, with \nrespect to the reporters' appearance today, is it your understanding \nthat the reporters are intending to invoke the same privilege cited \nby them yesterday, if called, when called, to testify by the \nplaintiffs?\n\n\n\n    Yes.\n\n\n\n    All right.\n\n\n\n    But that's the reason why I had asked if we could have \nthis conference.\n\n\n\n    The floor is yours.\n\n\n\n    Thanks. I'm not here to discuss law. I think we have \ndiscussed the law ad nauseam with respect to briefs, argument. I \ncertainly understand the opinion and orders that have been rendered by\nthe Court, and I appreciate them.\n\nAnd I don't want there to be a misunderstanding in terms as to this\ncase being wrongly focused. And what I mean by that, with regard to\nall of you in this room is that we've got approximately 40 people from\nthe media that are observing this trial in the courtroom, plus \noutside of the courtroom.\n\nIn speaking for myself, it would be my humble opinion that if these \nparties were called to the stand to testify and refuse to testify, \nas I just indicated to you, Your Honor, that I think the focus of \nthis trial all of the sudden isn't addressed as to intelligent \ndesign, but rather the media is going to be very much concerned in \nterms as to these stringers, not full-time employees, not employees at\nall, standing up for what they think is right. And I really truly \nbelieve in my heart of hearts the focus gets misdirected. I really \ntruly do mean that, because I don't think that should be the focus \nof this case.\n\nAs a result of that, Mr. Barna and I have spent days in an effort \nto try to see if there was a means by which we could somehow \nameliorate the problem so that, in a certain sense, everybody gets \nwhat they want. I clearly will not get what I want, because at the \nend of the day, if I agree that my reporters are going to testify \npredicated upon something that I want to propose here, that's more \nthan I would want, because I stand by the fact and they stand by \nthe fact that there's a reporter's privilege here.\n\nThey refuse to testify at a deposition, and my suggestion to them \nwas that if we were capable of resolving something as a result of \nthis conference, that they would then attend a deposition, because I \nbelieve the defendants would have a right to cross-examine them or \notherwise examine them prior to them taking the stand. And based upon\nthat, they would then testify in court.\n\nBut we have several issues. One is that when we filed our motion to\nquash last week, quite honestly, we thought we did it in a timely \nfashion because we filed it only after we were served with the \nsubpoena. Your Honor summarily dismissed that motion to quash, so, in \neffect, if my reporters were to be called upon to testify today by \nthe plaintiffs, they're undressed. They've got no protective order at \nall. They're just regular people. Because the order I believe that \nyou had previously entered related to the deposition and not related \nto their appearance in court. So that raises an issue for us because\nclearly we would otherwise object to them taking the stand under the\norder as it currently exists or the motion that you're -- your \nposition that the motion to quash could not stand.\n\nI interpret the order and the amended order to mean that Your Honor,\nin a sense, has addressed them as fact witnesses. I don't think you\nactually come out and use the word \"fact witnesses,\" but as one \nreads the order, that's the implication. And you initially had \nindicated that you did not feel that the reporter's privilege stood \nin this kind of a case.\n\nThese two newspapers respectively go to approximately 89 municipal meetings\nin terms of different municipalities and school districts. And \nironically -- in a sense, I have to commend both Mr. Maldonado and \nMs. Bernard-Bubb because, again, they're paid per story. They get \nanywhere between $40 and $50 a story. They might make $300, $400 a \nweek if they write X number of stories, and that's it. And the \nstories that they write predominantly are municipal stories.\n\nShe's a full-time mom. She's breastfeeding. She has a seven-month old \nchild, and so she works at night when her husband is at home. He's \na schoolteacher. Mr. Maldonado owns a little deli in the market in \nYork, and he home-schools his son, his youngest son who has learning \ndisabilities. And he's been doing that for the last three years. So \nthis is just supplemental income to them because they're not very \nwealthy people. But yet without a lot of education in terms of \njournalism, they believe that what they're standing for is the right \nthing.\n\nI don't have control over them as I would an employee of the Daily \nRecord or the Dispatch because they are stringers and independent. So \nhaving said that, their fear is that because of all those \nmunicipalities that they cover and the school districts that they \ncover, that at least in the Middle District Court, should a matter \ncome up similar to this case, then they are exposed as a fact \nwitness.\n\nI've related to them, quite frankly, this is the first case we've \never had in federal court in the years that I've been doing \nnewspaper law, and most of our cases are in county courts, and so, \nyou know, there's a different issue there. But having said that, the \nconcern that I have is that there is a precedent being set in the \ncounties that these people otherwise work.\n\nSo how do I make it better? Well, we provided an affidavit, and \nthat affidavit indicated that we, if called upon to testify, would \nvalidate the authenticity of the articles that were written. We did \nthat, in effect, to offer to both sides so that we wouldn't \notherwise have to testify. Accepted by the plaintiffs, not accepted by\nthe defendants. Defendants wanted to have the right of \ncross-examination.\n\nAnd at the time when you wrote the original order and you used the \nwords \"perceived, saw, and heard,\" we were concerned, as you well \nknow, with the word \"perceived\" in terms as to what's the thought \nprocess. And there was dialogue on the phone amongst all of us, and \nyou made it very clear that you did not want any testimony that \nwould otherwise relate to biases and prejudices. And, in fact, when \nyou reviewed the notes of the reporters, you had also indicated that \nyour review of Heidi Bubb's notes and the e-mails clearly evidence \nthat there was no bias in the writings, those writings.\n\nThe concern that we currently have is that the order reads, in \neffect, that they have to testify as fact witnesses, predicated upon \nmy interpretation, as to what is otherwise unpublished material so \nthat, for example -- just using this for example.\n\n\n\n    That's not my intention.\n\n\n\n    No, no, but I --\n\n\n\n    Well, that's not my intention. And I wanted to let you \ngo as far as you could, and I think I have to interject and I \nwant to interject and I want to be clear, because I think it's \nimportant that I do that. Let me address a couple points that you \nmade.\n\nFirst of all, I understand and deeply respect the position that \nyou're in in this case. And by saying that the motion was untimely, \nit was not legally untimely, it was untimely in my view only in the\nsense that it came, as I said, on the eve of trial, when we knew \nthat there was going to be an issue with respect to their testimony \nat trial. It was an attempt to bring this to a head. It was \nsuccessful in that respect. It was not successful in solving the \nproblem, but it was successful to bringing it to a head. So to that\nextent, I succeeded, good, bad, or indifferent.\n\nWith respect to the point that you made as it relates to their \ntestimony at trial, that is a very valid point. However, I will tell\nyou that the sense of my opinion as it related to their deposition \ntestimony and as reconsidered and as honed in the reconsideration, was\nthat it was meant to apply -- the general thrust of that, the \nprotections, if you will, in that opinion were meant to apply in the\nsame sense to their testimony at trial, if they chose to testify, \nand they would be protected in every way by the Court, and they \nwould not be questioned in the broader sense. So it would not revert\nback to an unprotected realm, if you will, at the time of trial.\n\nTo be as clear as I can be, at issue in this case -- and I can't \nparticularly be concerned about precedential value. I understand your \nconcern in that regard. I have to try this case the best way that \nI know how. The concern in this case, and it is a vital concern by\nall parties, is that we have, as you well know, to restate the \nobvious, we have newspaper articles within which there are quotes from\nindividuals. Those quotes go, at least in one sense, to the purpose \nbehind the policy that was enacted by the Dover School Board.\n\nThe simple issue here, because it is the Court's understanding that \nthese individuals have denied that they made these remarks, is from \nthe plaintiffs' standpoint how can they get something that is, in my \nview, on the purpose test, which clearly goes to the truth of the \nmatter asserted, how do they get these newspaper articles into \nevidence? Well, they can't, in my view, without the reporters \ntestifying.\n\nThe defendants might say that even with the reporters testifying, they\ncan't get them in. I think that's their argument. But at the very \nleast, in my view, and I think the plaintiffs might agree with this,\nthe reporters would have to testify.\n\nI didn't say this strictly in the opinion, perhaps, but my opinion \nwas not meant to allow the testimony of the reporters to go in any \nway, in particular, outside the four corners of the affidavits \nrendered by the reporters. I can't say that to the word, and that's \nwhy the opinions were crafted the way that they were. The Court has \nto have some discretion on the questioning.\n\nBut I was as clear as I could possibly be that what is at issue \nhere would be, for example, the particular events that the reporters \nwrote about and questions such as -- simple questions, did they attend \nthe meeting, did they hear them say the comments, did they write the\nstory immediately after, did they take notes at the time of the \nmeeting.\n\nI thought my opinion was clear in that regard, and as you \nappropriately characterize, no questions as to bias or motivation or \nreasons to misrepresent quotes would be allowed in. There I believe \nwe would decidedly fly in the face of established case law.\n\nI did not view and do not view the law as providing that there is \nsome exhaustion requirement, although I understand some cases have said\nthat. In this particular fact situation -- and I do think, I will \nsay, on the issue of precedent, you can distinguish cases of -- and \nI'm not so sure I would be as fearful as some might be as to \nprecedential value. I think this case is somewhat distinguishable, and \nI don't know that a judge in another situation would knee-jerk allow \nthis type of testimony. We are in a very unique situation here, and \nthat's what we have.\n\nFinally, the last thing that I want to do -I'm answering soliloquy \nwith soliloquy here. I'm not sure if this is a dialogue. Finally, I \nam acutely cognizant of the fact that this trial has abundant media \ncoverage, and it is surely not my intent to force a constitutional \nconfrontation with two reporters and to create a side show that we \ndon't need to. That's why we're meeting in chambers.\n\nBut I'll tell you that if it's their persistent position that they \ndon't want to testify, then we'll go on the record -- now, I'm not \ngoing to put them on the witness stand. I don't think it's necessary\nto do that. I would bring you and the reporters, I will tell you, \nto the bar. I will swear them in, I will have them sworn in. I \nwill ask you the question whether they're going to testify. I will \nallow them to speak for themselves on that point, and then we'll \ndecide what we're going to do at that point.\n\nI don't know what else to do, but I'm not going to go through the \ncharade of having them take the stand and assert, you know, as \narticulately as they can the privilege that they believe that they \ncan avail themselves of.\n\n\n\n    That's fine.\n\n\n\n    I interrupted you, but I think it was necessary to do \nthat.\n\n\n\n    Well, let me share with you why I have the issue that I \nhave. About a week and a half ago I had a telephone dialogue with \nEric because I had proposed to Eric the possibility that in light of\nyour most current order and because you took out the issues of \nbiases and things of that nature and because we're going to be \ncalled to trial by Eric, that maybe he should be speaking to Pat to\nsee whether they would be willing to accept the affidavit in lieu \nof the testimony.\n\n\n\n    I think we're beyond that.\n\n\n\n    Well, and then what happened was, we had a conference \ncall, Eric, Pat, several others in Pat's office and myself and Terry.\nThey indicated that they would not. And then in the course of that \nconversation, the defendants counsel had stated, for example, we would \nlike the opportunity to ask if they heard Mr. So and So say \nsomething, why didn't they write that. That's what I'm concerned about\nwith respect to --\n\n\n\n    I'm not going to allow that question.\n\n\n\n    But you weren't at the deposition, meaning you don't know \nthat that question wouldn't be allowed and quite frankly yesterday you\nwere in trial.\n\n\n\n    I said, though, very clearly in the last order, I \nthought, in the September 12th order, that I would be available. And \nI thought, when I heard that the reporters, quite frankly, appeared \nfor depositions, that when I was on a break, I was going to hear \nan accumulated list of questions that were objected to and that I \nwould have to rule on those questions.\n\nNow, I don't have time to preside over a deposition at this late \ndate. And I know that you respect that. You're experienced counsel \nand you know that. I do know from my private practice experience \nthat I was extremely loathed to get a judge on the telephone in \nmid-deposition. That could be one of the most unhappy experiences that\na lawyer would have.\n\n\n\n    You got it.\n\n\n\n    Depending on the time of day and the personality of the \njudge.\n\n\n\n    Especially after your last opinion on my case, I \ndon't want to call you at all.\n\n\n\n    As you see, I'm far more genial than I express in \nwriting. What I invited by that opinion, though, was that I would be\navailable -- and I believe in an issue that is as important to the \nreporters and to you, as their counsel, as this, it is appropriate \nfor you to stop a deposition on a question like that, instruct your \nwitness not to answer, and allow the Court to rule on it. I was \ninviting you to do that. Now, I understand what your reasons are for\nnot doing that, and I think you can do that.\n\nNow, if you're telling me that you have problems with certain \nanticipated questions but not others and if you're telling me that \nthe reporters would not exercise the privilege if they were kept \nroughly within the confines of their affidavits --\n\n\n\n    I go beyond that. I'm willing to have them testify as to \nwhat they wrote in the article and basically forget the affidavit.\n\n\n\n    That's fine.\n\n\n\n    That means everything that's set forth in that article.\n\n\n\n    Well, then I think we've clarified that point. Then I \nthink you should reschedule the depositions and try to do that.\n\n\n\n    Well, if I can interject -- I mean, this is kind of like \nmy last hurrah.\n\n\n\n    We could only hope not.\n\n\n\n    It depends what happens next week. Because we don't have \nan order with respect to trial testimony -- and we don't, except for \nthe fact that, again, they're naked.\n\n\n\n    I'll produce that order, if necessary.\n\n\n\n    Well, let me share with you where I'm coming from, because\nI think what I've done here -- and obviously I can't do your job. \nBut what I'm proposing here, if you could just evaluate it.\n\n\n\n    Depending how long this trial goes, you might be my guest\nin terms of doing my job.\n\n\n\n    All I'm doing is adding something to what it is that you \nbasically have already written. And if I could just read this. You \nhave no idea how long it took us to write this. Because I think it\ndoes exactly what you just said.\n\nIt says, Wherein an affidavit is provided in lieu of testimony to \nsupport a newspaper article or newspaper articles, the reporter shall \nbe obligated to testify as to the facts set forth in the articles, \ni.e., what was seen and heard as related in the newspaper articles.\n\nBy doing so, the reporters would be verbalizing the contents of said \naffidavit -- I think, actually, they were your words when we had the \ntelephone conference -- by testifying as to what appears in the \nnewspaper article or articles, unless such affidavit is otherwise \naccepted by all parties as validating and authenticating the contents \nof the newspaper article or articles in issue. Meaning if they accept\nit, it becomes moot.\n\nHowever, no testimony shall relate to unpublished material or \ninformation or to the reporters' motivations, bias, mental impressions, \nor other information extrinsic to what the reporter saw and heard, \nand the reporter shall not be obligated to reveal any confidential \nsources.\n\nWhat I've tried to do here is to say, they'll testify as to \neverything that appeared in those articles. And how I then distinguish\nthis case from maybe my next case is, where an affidavit is \nprovided and the Court or the parties don't accept the affidavit.\n\nWhat I've done is, it says that there's no extraneous unpublished \nmaterial questioning. That's the clarity that I need. And then, quite \nfrankly, my mindset is, if the issue of the defendants is that we \nwere biased in our reporting because we either misquoted somebody or \nwhatever, well, this isn't a jury trial. You're trying this case. \nYou're either going to believe the reporters or you're going to \nbelieve Mr. Buckingham or Mr. Bonsell or whomever when they say, I \ndidn't say that. But my concern is that I have to have some degree \nof certainty by your order that they can't ask any questions as to \nunpublished materials.\n\n\n\n    Are you suggesting that this language\nshould apply to both the depositions and the trial testimony? \n\n\n    Meaning if you could adapt language similar to this for the \ntrial testimony and I agree, I have no problem in them being at a \ndeposition prior to trial with the same kind of language relative to \nthat. I will appear at a deposition prior to trial. I would like to\ndo that, because of my own health conditions, maybe on Friday in \nterms as to a deposition, if that works within anybody's schedule, \nand then maybe the latter part of next week. Because what I did \nwas, I put my surgery off until next Friday to get this done.\n\n\n\n    Well, the problem Friday, I assume you fellows are getting\nout of here on Friday, but I'm not sure of that.\n\n\n\n    Or we could do it Monday.\nI mean, whatever works. \n\n\n\n    Well, we do have Friday morning\noff.\n\n\n\n    Right.\n\n\n\n    Although you may have something scheduled in terms of \npretrial planning. I'm not sure. Do you know?\n\n\n\n    I have a plane flight.\n\n\n\n    I was not going to be here.\n\n\n\n    Do we need the whole team?\n\n\n\n    I was the one going to take the deposition.\n\n\n\n    Yeah, Ed was there yesterday.\n\n\n\n    Alternatively?\n\n\n\n    Well, we'll do what we have to do.\n\n\n\n    Scheduling usually isn't my pay grade, but, you know, you \ncan figure that out. Go ahead.\n\n\n\n    Judge, if I may, there are some things here that we can\nagree with, but there are others that we can't. And this is why, \nin our opinion, Judge. You know, if our clients are believed, the \nreporters did talk to them but took misrepresentative statements so \nthat they left things out to put them in a false light and in so \ndoing have created articles that, if they were admitted for the truth\nof the matter asserted, would be misrepresentative.\n\n\n\n    Well, that's what I'm not going to get into. And I \nunderstand and I respect that argument. But I think I've got to \nline-draw here someplace. And I understood that argument before. And \nwhat I don't want to do here is turn this into an oral argument on\nthings that I've already decided. And I know you respect that.\n\nI think there is a privilege here, and I think the privilege \nsometimes gets drawn in what appears to be an ad hoc manner. But my\njob is to find where to put the line down in this case. To \ntraipse into the area of why they selectively used a quote as \nopposed to not using other things that were said I think is to get \non a very slippery slope. It really almost precipitates a bias line \nof questioning, and I'm not going to allow it. I am trying to \nnarrowly draw this.\n\nI understand that that's not what the defendants want in this case, \nbut I don't think it's called for. And, as a matter of fact, I \nthink if I did that and I ordered that and if -- I assume that the \nreporters would not testify and I would predict, if it went to the \nThird Circuit on that basis, I would be reversed. I don't think that\nthat's a fair area of inquiry to get into.\n\nThis looks artificial when you're dealing with a fact witness, but \nthese are fact witnesses who are also reporters, and I am straining \nto try to find a fair way to do this. I believe that to the \nextent -- and I've said this now several times -- that the reporters' \ntestimony is necessary in order to invoke the residual hearsay \nexception under Rule 807, that the defendants have to have an \nopportunity to examine the reporters on the same topics and subjects \nthat I would allow the plaintiffs to question them on during their \ncase-in-chief, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nSo I'm inclined to accept this language, you know, not word for \nword, only to the extent where it states, rather generically, \"wherein\nan affidavit is provided,\" I would take that sentence and simply say\nthat affidavits have been provided, rather than \"wherein.\" It's \nsomewhat artificial or a little strained as it relates to this case.\n\nThe rest of it I don't have any problem because I think it does \nnot do violence to my opinions. And this gets into a semantical \nexercise to some degree but one that is important, I understand, to \nthe reporters. We have got to cut the Gordian knot here. Either --\n\n\n\n    We can live with this, and they would testify if we had \nlanguage similar to this.\n\n\n\n    Well, my intention would be to enter an order that is a \nwrap-around order, if you will, that is, in effect, a \nre-reconsideration of the order on the depositions but also speaks to \nthe trial testimony in chief. And it will be abbreviated because of \nthe time constraints on me, but we'll issue it forthwith, and it \nwill indicate that you're going to -- they're going to sit for \ndepositions under those circumstances.\n\n\n\n    Can I ask whether that would be reported?\n\n\n\n    In what sense? When you say \"reported,\" what do you mean \nby that?\n\n\n\n    \"Reported\" meaning in the books.\n\n\n\n    Oh, published. \nWhen you say \"reported\" and you're talking about reporters, then I'm \nthinking, I have enough work in this case. No, we wouldn't publish \nit, but there are reporters who can access the CM/ECF system.\n\n\n\n    No, the reason why I'm asking whether it would be \npublished, I don't know whether your original opinion --\n\n\n\n    You're worried about the precedential value. No, it's not \nmy intention to publish it. I have no need. However, good or bad \nnews travels fast, and in the legal realm it will be cited by \nsomebody someplace.\n\n\n\n    You have no idea.\n\n\n\n    Oh, you'd be surprised.\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, just in an effort to avoid needless procedure\nor inquiry, if I could just get a sense for what you have in mind\nand intend by the order. If they show up for deposition and begin \nto testify about an article about June 14th, --\n\n\n\n    Hypothetically?\n\n\n\n    Hypothetically. Would we be at liberty to say, did you \nhear anything else, did you see anything else? \n\n\n\n    No, because\n-- and I know this is difficult, but it goes like this. And this is\nthe best I can put it, other than what I tried to do in my \nopinion. We have articles. We have a situation where the declarants, \nthe quoted individuals, have apparently denied -- either denied, I guess\n-- I'm not sure about this. This is my understanding, either denied \nthat they said what was reported in the articles or said that they \nwere statements taken out of context. And they can speak for \nthemselves. And that's one of the reasons that I'm line-drawing here. \nThey can say that, and I'll take that under consideration.\n\nBut from the reporters' perspective, were they at the meeting. The \nobvious answer is yes, but they haven't answered that under oath. Did\nthey hear the statement that is included in the article? Perhaps \nwhere were they standing in the room, did they utilize a tape \nrecorder for the purpose of taking down the statement or did they \nuse a tape recorder and did they take notes contemporaneously with \nthe statement. How long after the meeting did they write their \narticle, did they use the tape recorder, did they use notes as it \nrelated to that statement. Those are the types of inquiries that \nrelate specifically to the contents of the article.\n\nTo allay Mr. Benn's concerns, I think it is not fair game to talk \nabout all the other things that they heard and why they wrote the \narticle the way they did and why they excluded quotes. I sincerely \nbelieve that that gets into journalistic integrity, and that's \nproblematic, and it's not my intent to allow that, nor would I allow\nany questioning on anything personal to the reporters. I think I \nspelled that out in detail in the prior orders.\n\nWe are going to simply have them testify for the purpose of \nauthenticating the contents of that article, nothing more, nothing \nless, because I really believe that to do more than that is to \ncreate, I think, a precedent which would have reporters called -- Mr. \nBenn, I think, fears that even this would do that. I don't share \nthat fear. But to go any further than that would mean that a \nreporter's veracity could be questioned each and every time something \nlike this comes up. I strain mightily not to have to do that. \nThat's what I'm talking about. Now, I don't know if that clarifies \nit.\n\n\n\n    It does, Your Honor, I think in large measure. And I \nwould ask this, with your leave, would it suffice to preserve my \nobjection that I object here in chambers on the record?\n\n\n\n    That's fine. And I note that, and that's why I wanted to\ndo this on the record. And I understand that you object to that, \nand I understand the defendants have interposed not only this \nobjection but they have also argued against that. And to the extent \nthat this really clarifies and reasserts what I have in my prior \norders, I think you've preserved your position as it relates to that,\nand I understand that position.\n\n\n\n    Thank you.\n\n\n\n    Anything from the plaintiffs?\n\n\n\n    We have no objection to the proposed modification, Your \nHonor.\n\n\n\n    All right. So with that brief change to what is a little\nbit awkward in the first sentence, the \"wherein\" -- and I don't mean \nthat facetiously, but just as it relates to this case, because this \nalmost looks like it's a contracted or --\n\n\n\n    I understand. I just wanted to make sure the word \n\"affidavit\" was in there.\n\n\n\n    We will recite that. We will get a clarifying order out.\n\nNow, for the purpose of -- because this is a very public trial. \nWhat's your intention, what are your thoughts regarding how we should \naddress this? Because it's known that this is a festering controversy.\n\n\n\n    That's an interesting question. I mean, if we're not called\ntoday, which we're not going to be, I don't know that it really is\nan issue. We just had dialogue in chambers, the judge is going to \nbe entering an order, and after we receive the order, we'll be able \nto make a decision in terms of where we proceed.\n\n\n\n    Well, I don't know about that. I think you can assume, \nunless you doubt my word, I'm going to issue an order -- and I'm \nvery serious -- I'm going to issue an order and that order will be \nforthwith. I would prefer that --\n\n\n\n    We can say that we've restricted the order in such a \nfashion that we believe the reporters will testify.\n\n\n\n    If I might be so bold, that we are satisfied with the \nresolution.\n\n\n\n    Thank you.\n\n\n\n    We expect an order that is consistent with our \nunderstanding of an agreement that we reached -- I will let it to you\nto address that. And my intention would not be to address this \nagain in open court this afternoon. We would just move on. You have \nother witnesses, I assume, to present, and we can move through this. \nI'm simply saying I don't want wiggle room that we're waiting to \nsee, because I've had that experience now before.\n\n\n\n    If you indicate to me as you have, that this is \nsatisfactory to you, I will indicate that we are satisfied with the \nprospective order that we understand the Court is going to enter and \nthat our clients will be testifying at deposition and at trial.\n\n\n\n    Because I'll adopt this, but I don't want to do this \nagain.\n\n\n\n    I understand.\n\n\n\n    And you don't want to do it again, I know, I recognize.\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, just one other clarification question. With \nregard to asking what they saw and heard with regard to all of the \nstatements and the articles, I would assume that's statements made \nafter the gavel banged and the meeting was over. Some of those \nquotes are afterwards.\n\n\n\n    Yes.\n\n\n\n    But can questions be asked as far as the context of \nthose statements? THE COURT: Ask the question that you want to ask.\n\n\n\n    When so and so said this thing, you know, it was in \nresponse to what, what question or what else was being talked about \nwhen this statement was made.\n\n\n\n    No. That's too amorphous a question. The issue here, I'll \nrestate, is the veracity of the articles themselves, did the reporter \nhear the statement as reported. If it was taken out of context, \nwe're not going to delve into that in this examination. The \nindividual who believes -- who was quoted and believes the statement \nwas taken out of context or flatly that he didn't or she didn't say\nit and it's inaccurate will have the opportunity to say that during \nthe defendants case-in-chief or at any other time during the trial.\n\nWe're not going to side door, you know, a bias argument by going \ninto context. Context is a dangerous thing as it relates to what \nwe're doing here. So, no, it's -- we presume that the statement was \nlikely given to the reporter upon a question being asked by the \nreporter, although it could have been volunteered. That's of no \nmoment.\n\nThe issue is, did the reporter hear the statement, was it reported \nadequately, not was it reported out of context, but did those words, \nas quoted, come out of that individual's mouth. Now, I can't be any \nclearer than that. All right?\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, one thing I might ask, since it is perhaps \nlikely that issues are going to arise during the deposition, I'm \nwondering if we could now attempt to schedule the deposition at a \ntime when everybody, including Your Honor, might be available to \nintercede.\n\n\n\n    Well, what's your next day that would be available if not\nFriday?\n\n\n\n    Monday.\n\n\n\n    Well, Monday I'll be in chambers in Williamsport all day.\n\n\n\n    I cannot do it Monday because I couldn't get here on \nSunday. My wife is going out of town, and I have to watch all the \nkids. I could do it Tuesday, I could do it Wednesday.\n\n\n\n    Tuesday and Wednesday is a Jewish holiday for me. I can't \ndo it.\n\n\n\n    How about tomorrow?\n\n\n\n    I'm leaving tomorrow.\n\n\n\n    Well, look, if it's any weekday other than next Friday \nwhen I will not be available -- I'll be traveling next Friday -- I'll \nbe available. And, you know, we'll work through that issue. And if \nyou're otherwise taking the deposition and we're at trial, I'll tell \nyou that we'll construct some mechanism -- and we kind of talked about\nthis a little bit yesterday -- where you hold the thought if counsel \ninstructs the reporters not to answer because it's a problematic \nquestion, and we can circle back and we'll deal with that later.\n\nI understand those things could come up in the course of the \ndeposition, and I'll rule on those as I can if I'm not instantly \navailable. So whether I'm sitting at trial or not -- and likely it \nwill be a day when I'm sitting in trial -- we'll deal with it.\n\n\n\n    How about later today?\n\n\n\n    You work that out. Let's get back on the record here, \nbecause we've got people waiting and I want to get going. You'll \nhave to work that out. But I will tell you in concluding that if \nit is at night, if you do it at night, I will give you my home \nnumber, and you can contact me so we get this finished. If we have \nto do that, we'll do it so we get it finished. I will not attend \nthe deposition, though. I stopped doing that when I got this job. \nAnything else? \n\n\n\n    No. Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n   (The discussion in chambers was concluded.)\n\n\n\n    We return in session, and I want to apologize to the \nassembled spectators and, of course, to the media. We handled a \nmatter in chambers that you'll become aware of in an effort to \nresolve a problem, and I think we did. These things arise during \ntrials from time to time. That is the first time that we've had \nthat type of matter in this trial. We may have others as the trial \nunfolds. But it was a necessary exercise. And we try to keep them \nat a minimum and we will keep them at a minimum during the trial.\n\nBut with that, we will go back to the plaintiffs. You may call your\nnext witness.\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, the plaintiffs would call Julie\nSmith.\n\n\n   JULIE SMITH, called as a witness, having been duly sworn or affirmed, testified as follows:\n\n\n   DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. HARVEY:\n\n\n\n   Please tell us your name.\n\n\n   Julie Ann Smith.\n\n\n   Where do you live, Ms. Smith?\n\n\n   Honey Run Drive, York, Pa.\n\n\n   And is that within the area covered by the Dover Area School District?\n\n\n   Yes, it is.\n\n\n   And how long have you lived there?\n\n\n   Fourteen years.\n\n\n   Do you have any children?\n\n\n   Yes, I have two children.\n\n\n   How old are they?\n\n\n   My daughter Katherine is 16, and my son Michael is 19.\n\n\n   Your daughter Katherine, what school does she attend?\n\n\n   Dover High School.\n\n\n   What grade is she in?\n\n\n   She's in eleventh grade.\n\n\n   Please tell us what you do for a living.\n\n\n   I'm a medical technologist.\n\n\n   And please summarize for us your educational background.\n\n\n   I graduated high school in 1979, and I graduated at York College with a degree in medical technology in 1984.\n\n\n   Now, did there come a time when you learned that the Dover Area School District Board of Directors was considering approval of a biology textbook?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And tell us, when did you learn that?\n\n\n   I learned that in June of '04.\n\n\n   And what was the basis for your knowledge?\n\n\n   I read it in the paper.\n\n\n   Do you remember what you read?\n\n\n   Yeah, I read it in the York Daily Record, and, yes, I do remember.\n\n\n   Please tell us what you remember learning at that time.\n\n\n   That the school district was very concerned about approving a biology text that did not include creationism.\n\n\n   And do you remember anything else that you learned at that time?\n\n\n   Not right off the top of my head.\n\n\n   Okay. Did there come a time when you learned that the school district board of directors had approved a biology text?\n\n\n   Yes, they did in August.\n\n\n   And what was the basis for you learning that at that time?\n\n\n   I read about it in the paper.\n\n\n   And did there come a time when you learned that the school district board of directors was considering a supplemental textbook?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And what was the basis for your knowledge of that?\n\n\n   I learned that from the paper, also.\n\n\n   And what did you learn?\n\n\n   That they were going to have Of Pandas and People in the classroom as a supplemental text to the biology book.\n\n\n   And did you learn about where that book was going to come from?\n\n\n   It was donated.\n\n\n   Now, did there come a time when you learned that the board had made a change to the biology curriculum?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And approximately when was that?\n\n\n   In October, I believe it was, in '04. It was in the newspaper that they were going to be teaching their intelligent design from Of Pandas and People.\n\n\n   And did you attend that board meeting?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   And did you learn anything else from reading the newspapers at that time?\n\n\n   Well, that they were going to read the statement in the classroom, yes.\n\n\n   Okay. Now, I'd like to ask you to take a look in the notebook at what's been marked as P127.\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Can you tell us what it is?\n\n\n   It's the newsletter that came to the house in the mail that told -- that had the statement included that they were going to be teaching in the biology class.\n\n\n   Now, do you know approximately when you received this?\n\n\n   Well, it says it was February, so I'm assuming it was February.\n\n\n   Did there come a time when -- let me withdraw that. Do you believe that the board's actions in this case, the change to the biology curriculum and its other actions, have caused you harm?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   And can you tell us what harm you believe that it has caused you?\n\n\n   Late in '04 my daughter came home from school, and I was discussing kind of what was going on in the district with her. And she looked at me and she said, Well, Mom, evolution is a lie, what kind of Christian are you, anyway, which I found to be very upsetting.\n\n\n   Did you ask her why she said that?\n\n\n   Yeah, I asked her why she said that, and she said in school what they had been talking about or amongst her friends and what's going on. She seemed to be under the impression that as a Christian, she could not believe that evolution was a science that, you know, was true.\n\n\n   And how did that harm you?\n\n\n   Well, it goes against my beliefs. I have no problems with my faith and evolution. They're not mutually exclusive.\n\n\n    No further questions of this witness. \n\n\n\n    All \nright. Cross-examine, Mr. Thompson. \n\n\n\n    Thank you, Your \nHonor. \n\n\n\n   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. THOMPSON:\n\n\n\n   Mrs. Smith, my name is Richard Thompson. I represent the defendants in this case. And do you recall in April where your deposition was taken by another member of the Thomas More Law Center, Patrick Gillen? Do you remember being involved in that deposition?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   Were you present in court for all the testimony that has been given in this trial?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   When did you get to court?\n\n\n   Tuesday morning.\n\n\n   Now, whose testimony have you heard so far?\n\n\n   I heard some of Ken Miller's. I heard Barrie Callahan, Bryan Rehm. I heard the gentleman this morning.\n\n\n   Okay. You were asked to become a plaintiff in this case by the ACLU, were you not?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   Didn't someone from the ACLU call you?\n\n\n   Yes, they called me. But I was actually asked by my friend at work, who said to me, would you be interested in having the ACLU contact you, and I said yes.\n\n\n   And so the ACLU contacted you, and you agreed to become a plaintiff in this case?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Now, will you agree with me that the policy which is the subject matter of this lawsuit, the curriculum change in the biology for ninth grade, took place on October 18th, 2004?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   That's when the board passed the resolution that changed the biology curriculum?\n\n\n   I believe so, yes.\n\n\n   And that policy was implemented for the first time in January of 2005. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   In January, 2005, where was your son?\n\n\n   My son was in college.\n\n\n   So he had already graduated from Dover High School?\n\n\n   Yes, that's correct.\n\n\n   And in January, 2005, where was your daughter?\n\n\n   She was in school.\n\n\n   What grade?\n\n\n   She was in grade ten.\n\n\n   So you will agree with me that this biology curriculum really only affected, as far as the statement was read, ninth-grade biology students?\n\n\n   No, that's not true.\n\n\n   So the statement was read to other classes?\n\n\n   No, but it would affect all the students at the school.\n\n\n   Well, listen to my question. This policy provided that the statement was read to ninth-grade biology students. Do you agree with that?\n\n\n   I agree it was read to ninth-grade biology students.\n\n\n   Okay. And your daughter had already graduated from the ninth grade?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   So at the time that this policy was implemented, both of your children were out of the ninth grade?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   Neither one of them would be subject to the statement being read to them. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   Okay. Now, you indicated to your lawyer that you got involved because of newspaper articles that you read?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   Okay. Now, is it an accurate statement that in the year 2004, prior to you becoming a plaintiff in this case, you had never attended a single board meeting --\n\n\n   That's not correct.\n\n\n   -- in 2004?\n\n\n   In 2004, that's correct.\n\n\n   Okay. Just please answer my question and then your attorney can ask you to explain if he wants to. So in 2004, prior to this -- prior to you becoming a plaintiff, you never attended a board meeting in that year?\n\n\n   In that year.\n\n\n   Okay.\n\n\n   Before that, yes.\n\n\n   In 2003, you never attended a board meeting. Is that correct?\n\n\n   No, I had attended board meetings previously.\n\n\n   I didn't ask you that question. I asked you, in 2003, did you attend a board meeting?\n\n\n   I'm going to say I don't remember which board meetings I attended.\n\n\n   In --\n\n\n\n    Objection. Arguing with the witness and beyond the\nscope --\n\n\n\n    I'm asking questions.\n\n\n\n    Excuse me, and beyond the scope\nof direct.\n\n\n\n    Wait, wait. One at a time. Let him finish, Mr. Thompson. \nFinish the objection.\n\n\n\n    Objection, arguing with the witness and beyond the scope \nof direct.\n\n\n\n    I don't find it beyond the scope of direct. It's \nappropriate cross-examination. It's overruled on that basis. We're \ngetting argumentative only because I think the witness and counsel are\ntalking over each other. Each of you let the other finish before \nyou start talking.\n\n\n\n    I apologize, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    There's a great temptation in cross-examination to talk \nover. That happens. So let's get a question on the floor. Why don't \nyou restate your question, Mr. Thompson.\n\n\n\n    Okay.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. THOMPSON\n\n\n\n   Is it true that you did not attend a board meeting in the year 2003?\n\n\n   I'm not going to say that's not true. I don't remember which board meetings I attended. I did attend some before '04.\n\n\n   Is it true that you didn't attend a board meeting in 2002?\n\n\n   I told you I don't remember which year I -- I attended board meetings during the construction project, so when that was, that's when I was there.\n\n\n   And that was the year 2000, was it not?\n\n\n   I don't remember.\n\n\n   Mrs. Smith, I'm going to hand you --\n\n\n   Your Honor, may I \napproach the witness? \n\n\n\n    You may.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. THOMPSON\n\n\n   Mrs. Smith, I'm going to hand you what purports to be your deposition that was taken by Patrick Gillen. I would like you to direct your attention to Page 13, and I would like you to read out loud the question that you are asked starting with Line 18 and all the way down through that page and then going on to the next page, Page 14, and reading from Line 1 through Line 4. And please read it out loud.\n\n\n   You want me to read out loud starting on 18?\n\n\n   Line that starts with Q, which represents the question that was asked by Mr. Gillen, and A represents your answer. Would you please read it out loud.\n\n\n   \"Let me just make sure I get you there and go on. You attended board meetings. Give me a sense of which ones you attended. They were not the board meetings\" --\n\n\n   Now give me your answer. So that the record will reflect, that was the question and now your answer, starting with Line 21.\n\n\n   You want me to read it?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   \"They were not the board meetings, and we were not discussing intelligent design. When I went to some board meetings, it was several years ago. We were discussing the building project, and it has nothing to do with the intelligent design.\"\n\n\n   And then go on to the next page, and the question that Mr. Gillen asked you starting on Line 1?\n\n\n   \"That is all I am trying to get a sense for. I am not familiar with the dates for the building project. Was that '03 or '02?\"\n\n\n   \"Was that 2003 or 2002,\" is that right, the question?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   Okay. And what was your answer?\n\n\n   \"I would say more like 2000.\"\n\n\n   So was that an accurate reflection of your memory at the time that the deposition was taken?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Okay. Does that seem right that the board meetings that you attended prior to being a plaintiff in a lawsuit was in the year 2000?\n\n\n   If that's what I said, that's what I recalled at the time, yes.\n\n\n   So based upon the response that you gave to your attorney, is it a fair statement that you began as a plaintiff in this case in December, 2004, without ever having personally witnessed the actions of the Dover School Board as they debated and enacted the policy on which this lawsuit is based? MR. HARVEY: Objection. It's compound. \n\n\n   BY MR. THOMPSON\n\n\n   Can you answer that question? \n\n\n\n    Now, wait. She's not \ngoing to answer it until I rule on the objection. Elaborate on your \nobjection.\n\n\n\n    I think there are several predicates to that question. He\nasked whether you were present at any of the board meetings while \nthey debated and then enacted this resolution, and I'm not aware of \nany testimony that they debated the resolution.\n\n\n\n    Well, I think it's a fair characterization that there was \ndiscussion about the\npolicy. I'll overrule the objection. You can answer\nthe question. Do you recall the question?\n\n\n\n    No.\n\n\n\n    Let's have the question read back, please.\n\n\n\n   (Previous question read back.)\n\n\n\n    That's correct.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. THOMPSON\n\n\n   In fact, all of the information upon which you -- strike that. In fact, the information that you were getting about what the school board was doing in 2004 came from newspapers. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   And I believe in your deposition you indicated that you looked at the morning newspapers almost on a daily basis?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   And when you were looking at the morning newspapers, that you got very upset about what you read regarding the Dover School Board and the policies that they were debating. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   What were the two -- what were the newspapers that you were looking at during this time?\n\n\n   I read the Daily Record every morning.\n\n\n   What about the York Dispatch?\n\n\n   Not regularly, no.\n\n\n   Okay. So that it would be a fair statement that even though what you were reading in the newspapers got you upset, that you never personally attended one of the board meetings in that year?\n\n\n   That's correct. There were personal issues in my life at that time where I was not able to do that.\n\n\n   And it is true that you never spoke to any of the members of the Dover School Board about the issues that concerned you. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   You never called them. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   You never e-mailed them. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   Did you write letters to the editor about what the school board was doing?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   So that the first time that the school board would know that you were upset with their actions is when they learned of you being a plaintiff in this lawsuit. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   Okay. Now, did you ever speak to any of the teachers at Dover High School before you became a plaintiff in this case?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   Did you ever speak to any of the reporters who had written the stories about what the Dover School Board was doing during this time?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   Did you ever receive any minutes or notes about what the Dover School Board was doing during this time?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   You never sent anyone e-mails or any other communication regarding this issue. Is that a fair statement?\n\n\n   That's a fair statement.\n\n\n   In fact, one of the issues in this case is this book Of Pandas and People. Is that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   You never looked at the book Of Pandas and People before you became a plaintiff in this lawsuit, did you?\n\n\n   I didn't feel that I could look at it. It was in -- I guess it was in the library at the school, but I was not aware if we could go in the school library and take out books or not.\n\n\n   Well, did you make any effort to go and look at it?\n\n\n   I really wasn't interested.\n\n\n   Now, your attorney referred to a newsletter that you received in February. Do you have a copy of that newsletter in front of you?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And I believe you indicated that you thought the newsletter was sent in February, 2002?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   Excuse me, 2005. Excuse me.\n\n\n   Correct.\n\n\n   Okay. Could we have that newsletter? I would like you to read from that newsletter on the top left-hand side in that box. Read it out loud, please.\n\n\n   \"This newsletter has been produced to help explain the changes in the biology curriculum. Unfortunately, a great deal of misinformation has been spread regarding this policy. We hope this publication will help those interested better understand the substance of the policy while eliminating any misconceptions some may have about the curriculum change. We sincerely appreciate your understanding on this matter.\"\n\n\n   Thank you. It was through this policy that you first learned about the statement that was going to be read. Is that correct?\n\n\n   No, I believe -- no, I heard about it before.\n\n\n   But did you actually see the statement before?\n\n\n   I don't think so.\n\n\n   So this was the first time that you saw the statement that was going to be read to the students in the ninth-grade biology class. Is that correct?\n\n\n   I believe so.\n\n\n   Okay.\n\n\n   As far as I can tell.\n\n\n   And so this newsletter was actually providing information to the residents of Dover as to what the actual newsletter was -- excuse me, what the actual statement was going to say. Is that correct?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Okay. So you had no problem with the fact that the newsletter was being produced, even though you had a problem with the policy. Is that correct?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   Now, there's a bit of street wisdom, and I don't know whether you agree with this or not, and that street wisdom is, don't believe everything you read in the newspapers. Have you ever heard that?\n\n\n   Yeah, I've heard that before.\n\n\n   Okay. And so if you don't believe everything in the newspapers, don't you think before you became a plaintiff in a lawsuit that you should have taken some personal action to verify whether things that were produced in a newspaper were really accurate?\n\n\n   I did talk to people in the district, other people in the district.\n\n\n   Who did you talk to?\n\n\n   People that I work with, other people in the district.\n\n\n   But you never even saw the policy until that newsletter came out. Is that correct?\n\n\n   I got my information from the newspaper, yes.\n\n\n   And the newspaper. Now, have you ever had involvement with newspapers before? Have you been interviewed? Have you been interviewed by news reporters before?\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   But would it be a fair statement to say in the normal experience that newspaper reporters might spend five, ten, or fifteen minutes interviewing a person and then only put one line of that interview in an article?\n\n\n    Objection. No foundation that she has any experience as \nreferred to in the question.\n\n\n\n    Do you want to respond to that Mr. Thompson?\n\n\n\n    Well, I think it's common experience and it's knowledge,\nit's common sense.\n\n\n\n    Now I think we're going afield. I'll sustain the \nobjection. We're now clearly outside the scope of direct, the \nobjection is sustained. \n\n\n\n   BY MR. THOMPSON\n\n\n   Well, you said that you were upset by the policy because it conflicts with your religion?\n\n\n   I said I was upset about it because I didn't find a problem with it with my religion. It does not -- I'm getting confused. I have a problem with it because my daughter came home from school and she says to me, What kind of Christian are you, anyway? So that's why I have a problem with it.\n\n\n   If you recall your deposition -- and I certainly will give you an opportunity to look at it if you don't recall it -- the incident that you're referring to, also you received information that your daughter was a member of a Bible club. Right?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And up to that point, you were not even aware she was a member of a Bible club. Isn't that correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   And that it was -- she had a lot of friends who went to Protestant fundamental churches. Is that correct?\n\n\n   Yes, she does.\n\n\n   And she received that information from her friends, her Protestant friends in school or in the Bible club. Isn't that correct?\n\n\n   I would assume that's where she got her information, from the Bible club at school. Plus they talked about it.\n\n\n   And the fact that someone believes in intelligent design does not make that inconsistent with the Catholic faith, does it?\n\n\n   I spoke to my deacon about this situation, and all I know is what he told me.\n\n\n   Is he a theologian?\n\n\n   He's a deacon at St. Rose Catholic Church.\n\n\n   Do you know if he has any particular expertise in Catholic theology?\n\n\n    Objection again. Beyond the scope of direct, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    She brought the issue up of religion, Your Honor, and \nI'm exploring that.\n\n\n\n    Well, I think it is beyond the scope, again, the \ncolorable scope of direct, and I'll sustain the objection. This is \nnot a deposition. This is testimony in the case-in-chief, and we're \nafield.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. THOMPSON\n\n\n   Now, the book Of Pandas and People, you don't mind that book being in the library, do you?\n\n\n   No, I don't have a problem with it being in the library.\n\n\n   You heard yesterday, if you attended the deposition of -- excuse me, the testimony of Mr. Rehm's, that the science teachers, in a compromised move, had agreed to put Of Pandas and People in the science class. Did you hear that? \n\n\n    \nObjection, Your Honor. Mischaracterizes the testimony.\n\n\n\n    In what sense?\n\n\n\n    I believe Mr. Rehm testified\nthat the teachers did not agree to put the materials in the science \nclass. \n\n\n\n    Your Honor, my understanding in --\n\n\n\n    And --\n\n\n\n    Now, wait, Mr. Harvey. Let Mr. Thompson speak. One at a \ntime.\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, my memory, if it serves me correct, Mr. \nRehm testified that they had reached a compromise with some of the \nboard members that they were going to allow the book Of Pandas and \nPeople in the science classroom.\n\n\n\n    My recollection is that he may not have used the word \n\"compromise,\" he may have used the word \"concession.\" I'm not sure \nthat there's a distinction as it applies here. I'll overrule the \nobjection. Did you hear Mr. Rehm's testimony yesterday?\n\n\n\n    Yes.\n\n\n\n    Well, then go ahead.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. THOMPSON\n\n\n   Whether it's \"concession\" or \"compromise,\" did you hear that the teachers had agreed to put Of Pandas and People in the science classroom?\n\n\n   I don't remember exactly what he said yesterday.\n\n\n\n\n    No further questions, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    All right. \nThank you,\nMr. Thompson. Any redirect? \n\n\n\n\n    No, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    \nThen, ma'am, you may step down.\n\nThat will complete your testimony. And I don't think we have any \nexhibits to enter, do we? \n\n\n\n    That's correct, Your Honor.\nP127 is already in evidence.\n\n\n\n    You may call your next \nwitness.\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, the plaintiffs call\nto the stand Plaintiff Christy Rehm. \n\n\n   CHRISTY REHM, called as a witness, having been duly sworn or affirmed, testified as follows: \n\n\n\n    Your Honor, again, may I make sure that she has the binder \nof exhibits? \n\n\n\n    You certainly may. \n\n\n\n   DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. HARVEY\n\n\n   Please tell us your name.\n\n\n   Christy Rehm.\n\n\n   Are you married, Mrs. Rehm?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Tell us the name of your husband.\n\n\n   Bryan Rehm.\n\n\n   Please clarify for us one important question, and that is, exactly how old are your children?\n\n\n   My children?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   I have a 14-year-old daughter, Alix, an eight-year-old daughter Paige, a seven-year-old son Ian, and a 15-month-old son Lucas.\n\n\n   And where does your family live? I mean your immediate family, you and your husband and your children.\n\n\n   Rock Creek Drive, Dover, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n   And how long have you lived there?\n\n\n   Approximately five years.\n\n\n   And had you lived in Dover previously to that in your life?\n\n\n   Yes. I grew up in Dover, I attended Dover High School, graduated from Dover High School. My family, my extended family, lives in the Dover area, including my grandparents, my parents, and other relatives. My parents currently still live in the Dover area.\n\n\n   And please tell us where your children are right now in school, the grades, please.\n\n\n   Grade level, okay, yes. The oldest is in ninth grade, the next one is in the third grade. I have a first-grader, and then obviously the baby is not in school yet.\n\n\n   And the oldest three children, do they attend the public schools in Dover?\n\n\n   Yes. Two of them, my oldest is at the high school, the Dover High School, and then I have -- the next one is at the Weiglestown Elementary School. And my son is hearing-impaired, so he is charged with the education of Dover School District, meaning that they have to provide his education, but he actually attends classes at a hearing-impaired classroom.\n\n\n   And your daughter that's in the ninth grade, is that at the Dover High School?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And is she taking biology now?\n\n\n   Yes, she is.\n\n\n   Please summarize for us your educational background.\n\n\n   As I said, I graduated from Dover High School. I attended Lock Haven University and Millersville University. I received a BA from Millersville University in English, and I also have a degree in journalism, as well. I later got a teaching certification and attended Penn State University where I received my master's degree.\n\n\n   Do you work outside the home?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   What do you do?\n\n\n   I'm a teacher, an English teacher.\n\n\n   Where do you teach?\n\n\n   In a public school system outside of York County.\n\n\n   And what grade do you teach?\n\n\n   High-school level, so tenth through twelfth grade generally.\n\n\n   Did there come a time when you learned that the Dover Area School District Board of Directors was considering a change to -- was considering approval of a biology textbook?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Do you remember when that was?\n\n\n   It was sometime in 2004. It was prior to the June meetings because my husband was a teacher at the school, so I often heard things that he would come home and tell me. So I knew that there was some discussion over the biology book, so sometime before that. I can't tell you exactly when.\n\n\n   Did you attend a meeting of the Dover Area School District Board of Directors on June the 7th of 2004?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   And why did you attend that meeting?\n\n\n   Well, because, like I said, my husband had been a teacher at the school, and he had sort of been directed by the high school principal to attend the meeting in support of the different things that were happening. There were other textbooks that were being adopted and controversies over them, and, you know, it was sort of a rallying thing, I suppose. And I went along because I live in the district, I pay taxes in the district, my children attend school in the district. I'm an educator, and I was curious about what was happening.\n\n\n   And can you recall anything that happened at that meeting on June the 7th?\n\n\n   I recall a lot of things that were happening at that meeting.\n\n\n   Please tell us what you can remember about that meeting.\n\n\n   Okay. Some of the -- I attended a lot of meetings, so facts blur together. What I do recall, I -- as my husband said yesterday, I was pregnant at the time, so I have some reason to remember certain things. But I recall Barrie Callahan speaking about the textbook. It was the first time that I had really ever been around Barrie Callahan, so she strikes me -that memory strikes me because my mother had known her previously. And she was speaking about the textbook, just questioning them. I don't remember her exact words. But I do know that she was upset with them about this textbook, the textbook process, the students not having a textbook. Obviously it was very distressing for her that the students in the biology class did not have a textbook.\n\n\n   Do you remember if any board member spoke back to her in response to her questions?\n\n\n   Yes. Bill Buckingham said to her -- and I know Bill Buckingham because at the time he lived down the street from my grandparents and for many years lived there. And he responded to her basically saying that there's, you know, a problem with the textbook, it needs to be balanced, comments about laced with Darwinism, it needed to be balanced with creationism. Comments of that nature is what he had said to her.\n\n\n   Do you remember --\n\n\n   I'm sorry.\n\n\n   I'm sorry.\n\n\n   And I distinctly recall Barrie Callahan sort of throwing her hands up in the air and saying, Oh, so this is about evolution. That was very distinct in my mind, just her mannerisms as she said that.\n\n\n   Do you recall a young man by the name of Max Pell speaking at that meeting?\n\n\n   Unfortunately I was in the restroom at the time that Max Pell was speaking because -- my husband told you I was eight months pregnant. I was actually nine months pregnant and due any day, so I spent quite a deal of time in the restroom. But I had excused myself to go to the restroom just after Barrie did this whole thing. In fact, I may have been walking out of the room at the time and in close proximity to her. And so at the time when Max was speaking -- I believe that there were people who spoke in between she and Max Pell. But at the time when he stood to speak, I was in the restroom and sort of coming back from the restroom, so I don't really recall exactly what his comments were. I know him because he was my husband's student, though.\n\n\n   Do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook?\n\n\n   Well, like I said, I was reentering the room from the bathroom, so I was sort of in the doorway. And I obviously didn't know what Max had said to the board but that he had spoken to the board. So the comments that were coming back were, I assume, directed at him. But there were comments from Bill Buckingham about brainwashing, and I remember hearing that, the whole thing about brainwashing, because it dealt with going to college and getting this education and students who go to college become brainwashed. And I was very upset by that because I attended college and I don't feel as if I were brainwashed. And also I recall Alan Bonsell making a comment about, you know, there are only two theories, there's this theory evolution and there's this theory creation, and if you're teaching only those two theories, then there's not a problem.\n\n\n   Do you recall anything else Mr. Bonsell said?\n\n\n   At this time, no.\n\n\n   Do you remember anything else that was said by any members of the public at that meeting?\n\n\n   At that meeting. Currently, I don't.\n\n\n   I'd like you to take a look at what's been marked as Exhibit P46. It's in the notebook in front of you. Just take a moment to look at it.\n\n\n   Okay.\n\n\n   Do you have that in front of you?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Have you ever seen it before?\n\n\n   This article, yes.\n\n\n   Did you see it at or around the date that it was published?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   What's the date on it?\n\n\n   The date is June 9th, 2004.\n\n\n   Who is the author?\n\n\n   The author is Joseph Maldonado.\n\n\n   And can you tell us what publication its from?\n\n\n   Yes. It is from the York Daily Record.\n\n\n   Now, did you just have an opportunity to read it just a moment ago?\n\n\n   Just now I skimmed it, yes.\n\n\n   Take another moment to look at it if you need to, but I would like to know whether it refreshes your recollection about anything else that happened at that meeting.\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Okay. Tell us what else -- after looking at that article, do you remember anything else that happened at the meeting?\n\n\n   Yes, I do recall Bill Buckingham making comments about, you know, the apes and monkeys -coming from apes and monkeys. And I also --\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, again, objection. It appears she's going to be \nreading from the article with her testimony.\n\n\n\n    I'm sorry.\n\n\n\n    It's a little hard to do this, but we'll sustain the \nobjection. Mr. Muise's objection is well-founded. Let me explain how \nwe can do this, how we must do this.\n\nWhen your counsel asks you the question, you may review the article, \ntake a look at it, see if it refreshes your recollection. It's \nimportant that having refreshed your recollection, if it jogs something\nor re-creates a memory, that you testify in answer to Mr. Harvey's \nquestion. Do not look back and read from the article as you're \ntestifying, please. All right?\n\n\n\n    Yes. Sorry.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. HARVEY\n\n\n   Now, do you remember anything else that happened at that meeting?\n\n\n   Yes. I remember comments about our country being founded on Christianity and not needing to teach the faiths of other people. And I remember talking to my husband about that in the car ride home, as well, because we're both teachers and I was -- when I hear things like that, I immediately think of my students, and I was thinking about the diverse group of students that I have in my classroom, who all have different religious viewpoints, and how difficult that would be to tell one student that, you know, we can't express your belief, but we can express that person's belief in the classroom. And I just find those things to be very upsetting when I hear things like that being said.\n\n\n   Now, do you remember if you attended another meeting of the Dover Area School District Board of Directors approximately a week later on June the 14th?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   And why did you attend that meeting?\n\n\n   Well, because there wasn't really a clear resolution to what had occurred the previous meeting. In addition, I was very angry when I left the June 7th meeting just because of the demeanor of the school board and the things that were being said. And, honestly, I thought that maybe it would set me into labor because of, you know, being angry, and at that point in time I was past my due date, in addition to caring about my children's education and everything I said previously.\n\n\n   Now, tell us what you can recall of the June 14th, board meeting.\n\n\n   Again, there were many, many things that happened at that school board meeting, and I can tell you that I was very much interested in what was being said. And so I pretty well made sure, at the beginning of that meeting, which went on for quite a long time, that I wouldn't miss anything, so I took care of my bathroom needs beforehand. And I recall the meeting starting with Bill Buckingham sort of -- I'm sorry, Trudy Peterman spoke about her -- actually, hold on. Give me one second to think about this. Yes, Trudy Peterman spoke. She was the high school principal at the time. And I know that she spoke because the thing that she said seemed very similar to her graduation speech that she had said just previously. My sister had graduated that year, and I attended the commencement ceremony. And she had talked about Visigoths and things like that that she had spoken about in her commencement speech. And essentially she was speaking up for the teachers and the biology textbook. And after she had spoken, Bertha Spahr also spoke, as well. She's the department chairperson, and, actually, I had her as a science teacher. And she presented information to the board, documents, that she and I believe other members of the science department had researched on, I guess cases that had been set down before on creationism in the public school system or something of that nature, just to show them that, you know, if they were still considering this idea, that they might, I don't know, be met with some litigation or something. After she spoke, Bill Buckingham had made a comment to her about her -- where did she get her law degree from. Can you give me one second? I'm wondering if I'm getting my meetings mixed up.\n\n\n    Objection, Your Honor. This is running into a narrative.\n\n\n\n    Well, I think it's still responsive to the question. Do \nyou want to put a question on the floor?\n\n\n\n    She was just thinking.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. HARVEY\n\n\n   Did you need to think and change your testimony in any way?\n\n\n   I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't getting my meetings mixed up.\n\n\n\n    You can finish your answer. Do you want to \nfinish the answer, or is that your answer?  \n\n\n    Yes, that's \nmy answer. I'm sorry, I recall something else, as well. I recall \nCharlotte Buckingham, who is Bill Buckingham's wife, speaking at that \nmeeting, as well.\n\nEssentially there were a lot of people in the community who were \nstanding and speaking at this meeting because they wanted to warn the\nschool board that they were not in favor of any legal action coming\nagainst the community, against the school board. They were afraid for\ntheir tax dollars.\n\nAnd Charlotte Buckingham I recall really being the only person who \ngot up to stand in defense of the school board, and she was Mr. \nBuckingham's wife, or is Mr. Buckingham's wife. And she quoted \nScripture, Old Testament, actually, all Old Testament Scripture about \nwhy the school board is right, basically. And she also talked about \nschool prayer and the need for school prayer in that speech that she\nhad prepared.\n\nIn addition, Reverend Warren Eshbach stood\nup and spoke at that meeting, as well, sort of urging the school \nboard not to proceed with this. And many other members of the \ncommunity spoke, as well.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. HARVEY\n\n\n   Did your husband speak?\n\n\n   I recall my husband speaking. In fact, he hadn't prepared to speak, but he was very upset, as many people in the audience were, and he stood up to speak. I don't remember his exact comments, but, again, it was a warning to the school board and -actually, not necessarily a warning, but just sort of reiterating what science teachers do in their science classes and how there is really no conflict here with the textbook.\n\n\n    \nObjection, Your Honor. It's a\nnarrative. The question was, did your husband speak.\n\n\n\n    Yes,\nhe spoke.\n\n\n\n    My next question was going to\nbe simply if you could tell us what -- but I think she's already \ntold us what she can recall her husband said.\n\n\n\n    Well, that answered the next question. That moots the \nobjection, and you can move to the next question.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. HARVEY\n\n\n   Do you remember Bill Buckingham speaking at this meeting?\n\n\n   Oh, yes. There were not many meetings where Bill Buckingham did not speak. And, actually, at that meeting -- I believe the beginning of the meeting was an apology, actually, which he had prepared in advance apologizing to the members of the community if he had said anything that offended them. And it seemed to me sort of an inappropriate apology because -- or maybe \"inappropriate\" is not the correct word, but not a sincere apology because almost immediately after he had given his apology, he started doing the same things that he had always done, which was to demean the public, to say negative comments.\n\n\n   Do you remember specifically anything he said?\n\n\n   Yes. He made comments like, years ago someone died on the Cross, can't we take a stand for Him. He made comments about the liberals in black robes coming and taking away our freedoms in the school. He made many, many comments at that meeting.\n\n\n   Now, did you attend any other meetings of the Dover Area School District Board of Directors that summer?\n\n\n   No, we didn't attend that summer.\n\n\n   And did you attend any meetings that fall?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Did you attend the meeting on or about October the 18th of 2004?\n\n\n   Yes, we did.\n\n\n   And can you just tell us briefly what you can recall about that meeting?\n\n\n   Well, there was -- at this point in time it was the change in the curriculum that was being proposed and voted on that evening. And, again, this was a heated meeting. There were many members of the community who stood to speak, science department members. Jen Miller spoke, although I didn't really know who she was at the time. I recall her speaking on behalf of her biology course. I recall Bertha Spahr again speaking. My husband again spoke at this meeting. And, again, other members of the community spoke at that meeting.\n\n\n   Did you and your husband stay for the whole meeting?\n\n\n   No, we didn't.\n\n\n   Now, during the time that you were at the meeting, did you hear any discussion among the board members about the reasons for the proposed change to the biology curriculum?\n\n\n   During the board meeting?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   No.\n\n\n   Did you attend a meeting the following week, on or about November the 2nd, 2004?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And can you remember anything from that meeting?\n\n\n   Yes. I recall Noel Weinrich who had spoken at other meetings, as well, was upset about the vote that they had taken and was sort of urging them to rethink the vote.\n\n\n   Do you remember anyone requesting access to --\n\n\n   Oh, yes.\n\n\n   -- a tape of the October 18th meeting?\n\n\n   Yes. Because my husband and I had left early -- we had our infant with us and he needed to get home -- we had heard that there were comments that were said after we left about teachers should be fired if they don't listen to the school board's directive. And we wanted to hear that for ourselves, so my husband had previously requested the tapes and then at that meeting he stood again to request the tapes. In addition, Barrie Callahan had stood to request the tapes at that meeting, as well.\n\n\n   And do you remember if any members of the school board spoke in response to either your husband or Barrie Callahan with respect to the subject of the tapes?\n\n\n   Yes. Barrie -- I'm sorry, Alan Bonsell said very clearly that -- Dr. Nilsen had said something, as well, about the tapes, that it's not policy or something like that, that this is not past practice, this is not policy, this is not standard policy to release tapes to the public. And additionally, Alan Bonsell made the comment that they couldn't release the tapes because after speaking with their solicitor, there would possibly be legal issues, ramifications if they released the tapes.\n\n\n   Now, I'd like to just ask you just a couple more questions. Mrs. Rehm, do you believe that the board's actions with respect to the change to the biology curriculum have caused any harm to you?\n\n\n   Yes, absolutely.\n\n\n   And can you please tell us how you have been harmed?\n\n\n   Well, in numerous ways. First, as a teacher, professionally, I feel that teachers in general are harmed, myself, as well, because there's a dichotomy here in what they're saying about this statement that they have passed on intelligent design as they're not teaching it. On the other hand, they've said that it enhances state standards and critical thinking. In my mind, everything that you do in a classroom is teaching. And I don't necessarily think that's just in my mind. I believe that's true of all educators. The way I dress when I go to work tells my students something. The statements I make or the statements that I do not make in my classroom tell my students something. So I think we're charged with, you know, having an ethical decision to make when we walk into the classroom, the things that we say and the things that we do, and so I think that's very important. But you can't say when you walk into a classroom, you're not teaching. And if that's what's happening in the Dover school system and my children are in that school system, that they're routinely establishing practices that is not teaching in the classroom, then that's shameful. In addition, I have a child who is in the ninth-grade biology class, and this has spilled over into other classes. It's not just the biology class that has been affected by this. My child has heard comments from other students, school board member students in her classroom about evolution being against their religion, and do you think we came from monkeys, how can you think we came from monkeys. It used to be a weekly occurrence. It's now a daily occurrence, and my daughter comes home from school upset about these comments that are being made to her and, you know, is looking for guidance on how to respond to these questions. Also, intelligent design is not a scientific concept. It's a religious concept. And because I don't subscribe to that particular brand of religion, I feel that I and my daughter, my family, are being ridiculed, and my daughter feels the pressure. I reserve the right to teach my child about religion. And I have faith in myself and in my husband and in my pastor to do that, not the school system.\n\n\n    Thank you. No further questions.\n\n\n\n    All right. Before we start the cross-examination, I think \nthis will be an appropriate time for our afternoon break. We'll take \nthat break for approximately 20 minutes, no longer than that, and we \nwill return with Mr. Muise's cross-examination of the witness. We'll \nbe in recess. (Recess taken.) \n\n\n\n    Mr. Muise, you may \ncross-examine. \n\n\n\n    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MUISE\n\n\n   Good afternoon, Ms. Rehm. Your oldest child is 14 years old. Is that correct?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And your child's name is Alix?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And Alix is presently in the ninth-grade biology class at Dover High School?\n\n\n   Yes, she is.\n\n\n   And my understanding from your husband's testimony yesterday is that she hasn't yet reached the section in biology that deals with evolution. Is that correct?\n\n\n   Yes. After looking at her syllabus, it appears that evolution comes later in the course. I wouldn't say at the end, but closer to the end of the course.\n\n\n   And so she hasn't heard this one-minute statement be read in the class yet?\n\n\n   She has not, no.\n\n\n   Now, you testified about two -- or several meetings, but two meetings in particular I want to ask you some questions about. And those are the meetings that occurred on June 7th of 2004 and then the meeting on June 14th of 2004. Okay?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   I believe you described these meetings as involving some heated exchanges between some board members and the public. Is that correct?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And it's my sense from your testimony that the majority of the statements that you appear to find objectionable were statements made by Mr. Buckingham?\n\n\n   No. There were statements made by many of the school board members that I found objectionable. It's just that Mr. Buckingham always seemed to say very inappropriate things. But in addition, Alan Bonsell said very inappropriate things, and Noel Weinrich said very inappropriate things. It's just that I didn't give much credit to Noel Weinrich's comments because he would say things like, Darwin's at least what, 60 years old, a theory becomes a theory if you say it over and over again. Those are the kind of things he would say. But they were all very outspoken.\n\n\n   Now, the controversy on the June 7th and June 14th meeting was surrounding the selection of a biology textbook. Correct?\n\n\n   June 7th and June 14th?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And the biology textbook that was in question at the time, I believe it was the version of the Miller-Levine biology book. Is that your understanding?\n\n\n   It very well could be. I'm not sure what the edition in debate was.\n\n\n   But the statements that you testified to and the controversy that you were describing was surrounding the purchase or selection of that particular biology book for the school district. Correct?\n\n\n   Yes, it was definitely the Miller-Levine textbook. I don't know what the edition was or the copyright date or any of that information, but I do know that it was that biology textbook that was being debated very rigorously.\n\n\n   And, in fact, the school district purchased the Miller-Levine biology book to be used as the primary text for the ninth-grade biology class. Correct?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And that would be the textbook that your daughter Alix will be using?\n\n\n   Yes, with the dragonfly on it.\n\n\n   She already has the book?\n\n\n   She has the book, yes.\n\n\n   Have you looked through it?\n\n\n   Have I looked through the book? Yes, I have looked through the book.\n\n\n   Do you have any objections with the book?\n\n\n   No, I don't.\n\n\n   She wasn't given a copy of Pandas and People, was she?\n\n\n   No, she was not.\n\n\n   So the only required textbook for that class was that biology book that was creating all the controversy on June 7th and June 14th. Is that correct?\n\n\n   To my knowledge, the only required book is that book, in addition to supplemental materials that the instructor has.\n\n\n   Now, you made a comment in your direct testimony that intelligent design conflicts with your brand of religion.\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Is intelligent design another brand of religion?\n\n\n   No. What I'm saying is that I believe intelligent design, as well as the ideas of creationism, in particular, the Young Earth creationists, which, I'm sorry, I don't agree with. don't agree with the age of, you know, the earth and their opinion. There are things that I do not believe. And I do not believe the same things as the board members who adopted that statement.\n\n\n   And so your understanding is intelligent design is the same as Young Earth creationism?\n\n\n   Well, to my understanding, intelligent design just presupposes that everything in life is too complex, that it has to be designed. But I also know that creationism was used repeatedly with the term -or, I'm sorry, not with the term \"intelligent design.\" Intelligent design came up after the fact. But I do know that, in its original context, it was creationism that was being used. And when I think of creationists, again, I think of Young Earth creationists, and I do not subscribe to that way of thinking.\n\n\n   And so, again, you're associating Young Earth creationism with intelligent design?\n\n\n   There is a connection in my mind, yes.\n\n\n   If you could be shown that intelligent design does not require the action of a supernatural creator and, in fact, is based on observable and empirical facts, would you change your opinion?\n\n\n   I believe that if intelligent design could be proved to be scientific, then I would believe it would belong in a science classroom. Would I believe it? I don't know that scientifically I'm qualified to say, you know, that I believe many scientific concepts because I'm -- I'm not a scientist. But I suppose that if intelligent design could follow scientific methods, then -- and it were proven to be scientific by scientists, it was accepted by scientific communities, then I would have no reason not to accept that.\n\n\n   I want to explore your understanding of what has actually taken place in this ninth-grade biology class that your daughter Alix is presently taking. Is it your understanding that Darwin's theory of evolution will be taught in this class pursuant to the Pennsylvania academic standards?\n\n\n   I would hope so. And as far as I know, that is the case, because Dover says that it is a standards-based school, and so I assume that when they say that and they say that students have to pass certain material before they can be advanced into new material, that they would have to be abiding by the state standards.\n\n\n   And I take it from your answer you have no objection to that?\n\n\n   To following state standards, no, I have no objection.\n\n\n   And so it's your understanding that the Pennsylvania state standards require students to learn about Darwin's theory of evolution and eventually take a standardized test of which that theory is a part of it?\n\n\n   Yes, the PSSA test, yes.\n\n\n   And you have no objection to that?\n\n\n   To my students taking a PSSA test, well, you know, I -- being an educator, I'm not in love with PSSA tests or standardized tests. But if you're asking me if I object to my daughter taking a standardized test with that information on it, of course not. I would hope that they would provide lots of academic information on those tests.\n\n\n   And is it your understanding that because Dover is a standards-driven district, that they're going to focus their class time on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standard-based assessments?\n\n\n   I'm sorry, can you repeat that?\n\n\n   Yes. Is it your understanding that because Dover is a standard-based district, the class instruction is going to focus on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standard-based tests that we were just describing?\n\n\n   Not only is that my understanding, but that is what I would expect.\n\n\n   And you have no objection to that?\n\n\n   No, I don't.\n\n\n   Is it your understanding that because Dover is a standards-driven district, that students will not be tested on the intelligent design theory?\n\n\n   As I know it and as it is written, there is no test on intelligent design.\n\n\n   And from your previous answer, I believe you do understand that the Dover School District purchased, for its ninth-grade biology class, the edition of the Miller and Levine biology book. Correct?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And you have no objection to that book being used in the class?\n\n\n   No, I do not.\n\n\n   Is it your understanding that this biology book provides thorough coverage of Darwin's theory of evolution?\n\n\n   Actually, did you ask me if it's my understanding or if --\n\n\n   If it's your understanding. I mean, you have to testify about your knowledge, ma'am.\n\n\n   Okay. What I've seen of actually Darwin in the textbook, in my opinion, is actually quite slim. It follows state standards, of course. And, actually, to me, it gives more of a historical context of Darwin than anything as far as what I have read. And I did look at that section, and I looked basically through the book. And it appears to be historical mainly in context of Darwin's time frame and what he did for science.\n\n\n   Has Dr. Miller left the courtroom?\n\n\n   Maybe we should ask. So if you're asking me if I feel it's enough or if it's -- I'm not sure what it is you're asking me about that. I feel, actually, that there are topics that probably could be explored in more detail, but I understand that there are limitations within any textbook that you have to hit on core concepts. I believe that core concepts are covered, but I think that, in my opinion, what I've looked at, it's historical context.\n\n\n   Is it your understanding that it presents Darwin's theory of evolution in a manner that is consistent with its standing in the scientific community?\n\n\n   As much as I know about the scientific community -- and, you know, you have to remember that's not my discipline. But as much as I know about what the high school science standards say, it would be in standing with that. As far as the scientific community, I really can't go there, because I know that there is a lot more about Darwin than is in that textbook. I mean, I can absolutely say that without knowing everything about Darwin or knowing everything about science.\n\n\n   Do you have any reason to believe that what's in the biology book is inconsistent with what the scientific community --\n\n\n   Absolutely not, no. No, I would have no reason to believe that.\n\n\n   Is it your understanding that the book Of Pandas and People was placed in the library for students to review?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   It's your understanding that no student was required to read any portion of the Pandas book?\n\n\n   Right, just as no student is required to read anything that's in the library unless they choose to.\n\n\n   You have no objection to Pandas being in the library?\n\n\n   No, absolutely not. I don't object to Pandas being in the library, just like I don't object to, you know, any of the other books being in the library, as long as -- as long as it's the appropriate level and -- you know, I mean, there is a censorship process that goes into putting books in the library. So, I mean, as long as it has gone through that process and it's approved to be there, I don't have a problem with it being there.\n\n\n   The statement that the school district developed to be read as part of the biology class, is it your understanding that the statement that was drafted in January, 2005, or for use in January, 2005, was modified in June of 2005? Are you aware of that?\n\n\n   Can you say that again?\n\n\n   I'm sorry, I wasn't that precise. The original statement that was drafted by the Dover School District was modified in June of 2005. Are you aware of that?\n\n\n   Well, I'm aware that that statement was modified several times. In fact, there were different drafts of that statement that I had seen. The exact modification, are you telling me that from the time that they had approved it in October, it was modified before it was read in January? Because it was again read in, I believe, like May, and there was a change from that point in time, unless I'm incorrect and that is the change that I'm thinking of.\n\n\n   Were you aware that there was a change made to the statement at one point to indicate that Pandas was in the library, as well as additional resources in the library addressing intelligent design?\n\n\n   Yes, I am aware that there was a change.\n\n\n   Are you aware of that change?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Is it your understanding that some of these additional books that were put in the library are actually critical of intelligent design?\n\n\n   Actually, I am, because I recall them -- an organization actually sending the library those books, because there was controversy in those books being put in there, too. And there were many members of the community who had called to see whether those books had actually gotten there or not, into the library, because we weren't certain that those books were going to be allowed in the library, permitted in the library.\n\n\n   They're in the library?\n\n\n   Well, a parent -- the books that are critical to --\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   I'm assuming that they had gotten there.\n\n\n   You never checked?\n\n\n   There were a couple instances where friends of mine had tried to check on the status of the books in the library but were not permitted to go in at that time. So I am only assuming that those books are there now because I am being told that they are. But as for myself walking into a library and seeing them there, I did not.\n\n\n   Do you have any objection to these additional books being placed in the library?\n\n\n   No, I do not.\n\n\n    No \nfurther questions, Your\nHonor.\n\n\n\n    Any redirect?\n\n\n\n    No, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    Ma'am, you may step down. That\nwill complete your testimony, and you may call your next witness. \n\n\n\n    Your Honor, plaintiffs call to the stand Plaintiff Beth \nEveland. \n\n\n\n   BETH EVELAND, called as a witness, having been duly sworn or affirmed, testified as follows:\n\n\n\n    State your name and spell \nyour name for the record. \n\n\n\n    Sure.

I just want to make sure \nthat this testimony, to the extent it relates to the newspaper \narticle, is subject to our standing objection.\n\n\n\n    Well, what is 46?\n\n\n\n    It's a June 9th article from the York Daily Record.\n\n\n\n    Well, I don't know what the question is. It may relate \nto your standing objection, but we'll note that. We'll hold that \nthought, and you can proceed with the question, because all we have \nis the exhibit that is a newspaper article. So let's proceed with \nthe question. There's no need to restate your objection, unless you \nwant to\nput a finer point on the objection. But at this point, proceed with \nyour question.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. HARVEY\n\n\n   Did you read this article on or around June the 9th of 2004?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   And following reading this article, did you attend any meeting of the Dover Area School District?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   And approximately when was that?\n\n\n   Approximately the end of June through the present.\n\n\n   What I'd like to know is if you attended a meeting after this June 9th -- excuse me, this board meeting that's reported in this article?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   And what was the date of the next board meeting that you believe you attended?\n\n\n   It would have been approximately June 15th, June 16th.\n\n\n   And can you tell us whether -- when you remember that you attended this board meeting?\n\n\n   When I remember that I attended this board meeting?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   In preparation for trial, looking back through my deposition testimony and thinking about things that had happened, it occurred to me that, you know, I was there at that June meeting.\n\n\n   And what is it about that June board meeting that made you remember that you were there?\n\n\n   I remember Casey Brown, one of the board members at the time, discussing, during the board meeting with the board, that she felt they were, I'm paraphrasing, treading, you know, on -- they were treading closely to violating the Pennsylvania State Board of Education regulations on religion in the classroom.\n\n\n   And do you remember anything that was said by any board members at that meeting that you attended in June of 2004?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   What do you remember?\n\n\n   I remember Bill Buckingham making the statement, years ago somebody died on the Cross, can't someone take a stand for Him.\n\n\n   Now, what was your reaction to what you saw and heard at the board meeting on or about -- I think you said June the 15th or 16th? I think, for the record, it's established that it's June the 14th. But tell us, what was your reaction to what you heard?\n\n\n   I was shocked. I was just utterly shocked.\n\n\n   And did you do anything in response to that?\n\n\n   Yes, I did. I had wrote a letter to the editor.\n\n\n   And was that before or after you attended that board meeting?\n\n\n   I wrote a letter to the editor -- I believe it was actually written before I attended the board meeting, but it wasn't published until after that June 14th board meeting.\n\n\n   And where did you send that letter to the editor, which newspaper?\n\n\n   I submitted it to the three local newspapers, York Daily Record, York Sunday News, and York Dispatch.\n\n\n   And did you do anything, before you sent it to those papers, with the content of the letter?\n\n\n   Yes, I did. I had e-mailed a letter basically stating the same thing in my letter to the board president at the time, Alan Bonsell, a copy to Dr. Nilsen, and I mailed a copy to Mr. Buckingham.\n\n\n   Now, please turn to what's been marked and is in the notebook before you as P56.\n\n\n   Okay.\n\n\n   Do you have it in front of you?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   And can you tell us what it is?\n\n\n   It looks to me to be a copy of a letter to the editor that I wrote.\n\n\n   And I'm going to ask you to read this letter into the record.\n\n\n   Okay.\n\n\n    Objection, Your \nHonor. This letter is hearsay.\n\n\n\n    Say it again. I'm sorry.\n\n\n\n    Objection, hearsay.\n\n\n\n    Why is it hearsay?\n\n\n\n    She's going to be reading in the letter, the contents of \nthe statement. It's an out-of-court statement. They're obviously \noffering it for the truth of the matter.\n\n\n\n    Who wrote the letter?\n\n\n\n    She wrote the letter.\n\n\n\n    Overruled.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. HARVEY\n\n\n   Please.\n\n\n   \"As a parent in the Dover Area School District, I must convey my shock and utter dismay at William Buckingham's comments regarding the search for new biology texts for the high school. I am especially upset with Mr. Buckingham's comments as quoted in Wednesday's York Daily Record: 'This country wasn't founded on Muslim beliefs or evolution. This country was founded on Christianity, and our students should be taught as such.' This statement is in direct contradiction to the mission statement of the Dover schools. \"In partnership with family and community to educate students, we emphasize sound, basic skills and nurture the diverse needs of our students as they strive to become lifelong learners and contributing members of our global society. What a slap in the face to many of the parents and taxpayers of the Dover area. How sad that a member of our own school board would be so closed-minded and not want to carry on the mission of Dover schools. \"His ignorance will not only hold back children attending Dover area schools, but also reinforce other communities' views that Dover is a backwards, close-minded community. If it was simply a matter of selecting a text that gives two contradicting scientific theories equal time, that would be an entirely different matter, but it's not. Creationism is religion, plain and simple. \"Mr. Buckingham's comments offend me, not because they are religious in nature, but because it is my duty to teach my children about religion as I see fit, not the Dover Area School District during a biology class.\"\n\n\n   Now, that letter was actually published in the paper?\n\n\n   Yes, it was.\n\n\n   And did you see it in the paper?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   And did you read any response to your letter in the paper?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   And can you tell us who submitted -- whose response did you read in the paper?\n\n\n   It was a published response noting Heather Geesey as the author.\n\n\n   And who is Heather Geesey?\n\n\n   She is a member of the Dover Area School Board.\n\n\n   And her response letter was published in what newspaper?\n\n\n   I believe it was either the York Dispatch or the York Daily Record.\n\n\n   And please turn to what's been marked in the notebook before you as P60.\n\n\n   Okay.\n\n\n   Does that help you remember, looking at it, what newspaper it was published in?\n\n\n   It was published in the York Daily Record.\n\n\n   And what is that that's marked as P60?\n\n\n   It is a letter from Heather Geesey to the editor in response to my letter.\n\n\n   And did you see it at the time?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   Please read that into the record.\n\n\n    Objection, Your Honor. Our standing \nobjection, as well as she has not established a foundation that \nactually Heather Geesey wrote this article. She has no personal \nknowledge.\n\n\n\n    Let me first view the exhibit. Do you want to respond to\nthe objection?\n\n\n\n    Yes, Your Honor. We submitted an exhibit list to the \nother side, and we were told there were no authentication issues with\nrespect to any of this, so there's no question about the \nauthenticity of this, nor do I understand -- and further, it's not \noffered for the truth of the matter asserted, so there's no hearsay \nobjection.\n\n\n\n    Well, on the authentication,\nlet's take it in two parts. My understanding was that there was not \nan authentication issue. That does refresh my recollection on that \npoint. Now, if there's not an authentication issue, we'll move on to \nthe second --\n\n\n\n    Actually, Mr. Muise may be at a disadvantage here. I did\nagree with Steve that we -he has an affidavit from someone who has \nindicated they have collected newspaper articles. So with respect to \nthat issue, there's no objection. I have agreed that she has \nauthenticated what she did to produce this article.\n\n\n\n    All right. Very well. So there's no question then that \nthis represents a letter written by Ms. Geesey to the York Daily \nRecord. Is that correct from the defense standpoint?\n\n\n\n    That is correct, Your Honor. That's the representation \nthat has been made in an affidavit, and I accept it.\n\n\n\n    Now, counsel for the plaintiff is indicating the letter as\nbeing produced on the issue of -- or to show notice, obviously, on \nthe effect prong. Do you want speak to that?\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, I would also note that it's an admission of \na party opponent.\n\n\n    And I think it would come in under that basis, but that \nwould be the hearsay justification or the justification that would get\naround a hearsay objection. But the purpose of the letter is under \nthe second prong. Is that correct?\n\n\n\n    It is for that purpose, and it's also to show that Ms. \nGeesey talked about the statements that were made in this letter at \nthis time. That's one of the issues in the case.\n\n\n\n    So it could go to truth inasmuch as it's an admission. \nIs that correct?\n\n\n\n    Exactly.\n\n\n\n    All right.\n\n\n\n    Your Honor, as you know, we've got the question of \nwhether or not these are admissible for effect. Our position on that \nwe've articulated. I don't know if you want us to argue at greater \nlength or brief, but it's hearsay to the extent it's offered for the\ntruth of the matter asserted as effect.\n\n\n\n    Well, I think that you reserved that argument. We've had \nthat discussion. I'm inclined -- because it's a bench trial, I'll admit\nit conditionally. Whether I'll consider it in my ultimate \ndetermination will be a function of the\nargument that I'm allowing you to reserve and make.\n\nBut for the purpose of this witness, conditionally and subject to \nadditional argument from counsel, we'll admit the letter and you may \nproceed.\n\n\n\n    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. HARVEY\n\n\n   Please read the letter.\n\n\n   \"This letter is in regard to the comments made by Beth Eveland from York Township in the June York Sunday News. I assure you that the Dover Area School Board is not going against its mission statement. In fact, if you read the statement, it says to educate our students so that they can be contributing members of society. \"I do not believe in teaching revisionist history. Our country was founded on Christian beliefs and principles. We are not looking for a book that is teaching students that this is a wrong thing or a right thing. It is just a fact. All we are trying to accomplish with this task is to choose a biology book that teaches the most prevalent theories. \"The definition of 'theory' is merely a speculative or an ideal circumstance. To present only one theory or to give one option would be directly contradicting our mission statement. You can teach creationism without it being Christianity. It can be presented as a higher power. That is where another part of Dover's mission statement comes into play. That part would be in partnership with family and community. You as a parent can teach your child your family's ideology.\"\n\n\n   And what was your reaction to that letter when you read it in the paper, Mrs. Eveland?\n\n\n   That really concerned me.\n\n\n   Why?\n\n\n   That made me question, first of all, was she writing on behalf of just herself or on behalf of the whole school board since it was signed Dover Area School Board Director, and I sensed a religious intonation.\n\n\n   Now, I'd like you to tell us, did you attend board meetings in after June?\n\n\n   Yes, I did.\n\n\n   And which board meetings did you attend?\n\n\n   All of them.\n\n\n   And do you believe that -- were you at the meeting on October the 18th of 2004?\n\n\n   Yes, I was.\n\n\n   And did you hear the board discuss any reason for adopting the proposed curriculum change?\n\n\n   No, I didn't.\n\n\n   Do you feel that you've been harmed by the board's actions?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   And please tell us how you believe that you have been harmed by the board's actions.\n\n\n   I feel it's my duty, as a parent, to introduce any kind of faith-based concept to my children, not the Dover Area School District. While my children are small, you know, this policy is district-wide, and there's nothing to prevent it from being trickled down into the elementary level. It's just something that I feel strongly that my husband and I, that's our task to bring faith to our children.\n\n\n\n    Thank you. No further questions. \n\n\n\n    All right. \nCross-examine, Mr. Muise. \n\n\n\n   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MUISE:\n\n\n   Good afternoon, ma'am.\n\n\n   Good afternoon.\n\n\n   You said your oldest child is seven years old?\n\n\n   Yes, she is.\n\n\n   And what grade is she in?\n\n\n   She's a second-grader.\n\n\n   So she's seven years out from attending the ninth-grade biology class at Dover High School?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   Now, you have an interest in science. Is that correct?\n\n\n   Somewhat, yeah.\n\n\n   I believe in your deposition you indicated in your day-to-day events you try to spark your children's interest in science?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   And you believe it's important to make science interesting for your children?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   You don't have any specific training in evolutionary theory. Correct?\n\n\n   No, I don't.\n\n\n   I want to get a sense for what your understanding is of what is going on in the ninth-grade biology class that your daughter will be attending several years from now. Is it your understanding that Darwin's theory of evolution is going to be taught pursuant to the state academic standards?\n\n\n   It is my understanding, yes.\n\n\n   And that students will be tested on subjects that are based on those standards, including the theory of evolution?\n\n\n   Yes, that is my understanding.\n\n\n   And it's your understanding that the students will not be tested on the theory of intelligent design?\n\n\n   That is also my understanding, yes.\n\n\n   Is it also your understanding that it is a standards-based district, so classroom instruction will focus on achieving those standard-based assessments in which they will eventually be tested on?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And intelligent design is not part of those standard-based assessments?\n\n\n   As far as my understanding, yes, it is currently not.\n\n\n   And these board meetings that you attended in June, the controversy was surrounding the purchase of a biology text for the class. Correct?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Do you know which book it was that the controversy was about?\n\n\n   I believe at the time it was the Miller and Levine biology text.\n\n\n   And isn't it true it was Mr. Buckingham's objections to that biology text which precipitated some of these statements that you were referring to in your direct testimony?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   And what action did the board actually take with regard to the biology book?\n\n\n   Well, with regard to the biology book?\n\n\n   With regard to the biology book for the ninth-grade class.\n\n\n   It's my understanding that they held off on the vote in June because there was a new edition that was going to come out. And they wanted to get the most current book instead of wasting money on an older book.\n\n\n   And so they ended up purchasing the version?\n\n\n   Yes, they did. Yes, they did.\n\n\n   Have you seen that book?\n\n\n   I have briefly looked at it.\n\n\n   Now, my understanding is you went to these board meetings in June because of the controversy over the biology book?\n\n\n   Yeah, part of it.\n\n\n   You said you just skimmed this biology book that was at the center of the controversy?\n\n\n   It was available on the table where the board was sitting, and I went up front and took a look at it for maybe a minute or two.\n\n\n   In those two minutes that you spent actually looking at the book that was the center of this controversy, was there anything in that two-minute review that you saw that you objected to?\n\n\n   No. I just basically looked through the table of contents quickly.\n\n\n   Is it your understanding that that book that was eventually purchased by the Dover Area School District covers the theory of evolution consistent with its status in the scientific community?\n\n\n   That's my understanding, yes.\n\n\n   Now, these meetings that you attended, would you describe them as being fairly contentious?\n\n\n   Fairly contentious, yes.\n\n\n   Shouting matches, I believe the term you used in your --\n\n\n   I think a circus-like atmosphere would be quite appropriate.\n\n\n   Now, is it your recollection that the first time the Pandas book was mentioned was during the July meeting that you attended?\n\n\n   I remember it being mentioned. I cannot give you a specific date. The dates run together after a while.\n\n\n   How about mentioning the theory of intelligent design, do you recall when you may have heard that theory first mentioned?\n\n\n   To the best of my recollection, it was first mentioned June, July sometime. At the time it seemed that creationism and intelligent design were kind of used hand-in-hand interchangeably.\n\n\n   During these public comments that precipitated some of those statements that you were referring to, was it your impression that Mr. Buckingham and Mr. Noel Weinrich were taking the comments as being personally directed toward them?\n\n\n   Not only them, but the vast majority of board members, yes, they were.\n\n\n   So they saw them as being personal attacks against them?\n\n\n   Yeah.\n\n\n   Now, the first meeting you attended in July, you spoke with Joe Maldonado. Correct?\n\n\n   Yes. And I believe the first -- as I testified earlier, the first meeting I actually had attended was the second meeting in June.\n\n\n   I guess my question is, the first meeting that you attended in July --\n\n\n   Yes, I had spoken to Joe Maldonado.\n\n\n   And who is Joe Maldonado?\n\n\n   It's my understanding he is a reporter with the York Dispatch.\n\n\n   And during this conversation, he approached you and asked if you had read or were familiar with some comments that he had quoted in the paper, and those were Mr. Buckingham's comments. Correct?\n\n\n   Yes, he had.\n\n\n   And he asked you what your thoughts were about those comments?\n\n\n   Yes, he did.\n\n\n   And he also asked you if you would ask for Mr. Buckingham's resignation on the spot. Correct?\n\n\n   That's correct.\n\n\n   And you told him that you didn't think that was going to happen?\n\n\n   I told him that I would just sit back and wait and see what happened.\n\n\n   And your sense for why he asked you this was that you thought he was trying to elicit something sensational for his paper?\n\n\n   There is that possibility of trying to elicit something sensational, but I think he was also trying to prepare for what might happen later on in the meeting since they tended to denigrate in shouting matches.\n\n\n    May I approach this witness, Your \nHonor? THE COURT: You may.\n\n\n\n   BY MR. MUISE\n\n\n   Ma'am, I'm handing you what is your deposition testimony that you gave on March 28th of 2005. And I'd like you to read, if you look on Page 64, read from Line 18 through 25, and then we'll continue on the next page once you finish that.\n\n\n   \"The first board meeting I attended in July he approached me before the meeting started and asked if I had read the -- if I was familiar with the comments that were quoted in the paper. I told him just simply what I had read. \"He asked me what I thought about it, and I said, The comments, I don't feel that is appropriate. He asked me if I asked for Mr. Buckingham's resignation on the spot. I told him I didn't think that that was going to happen.\"\n\n\n   And the next line, Line 3, is a question which states, \"When Mr. Maldonado asked you that question, do you have a sense for why?\" Could you plead read your answer, which is Lines 5 through 8.\n\n\n   \"Yeah. Based on what was quoted in the paper, yeah, I think he was trying to elicit some sensational whatever for the paper. It was my first board meeting. I just wanted to sit back and see what would happen.\"\n\n\n   Were you testifying truthfully during that deposition?\n\n\n   Yes, I was, to the best of my knowledge.\n\n\n   You've had additional discussions with Mr. Maldonado about the happenings with the board. Correct?\n\n\n   Yeah.\n\n\n   And you also had conversations with Ms. Heidi Bubb?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And she's a reporter?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   For which paper?\n\n\n   She's a reporter for the Dispatch. I said earlier Mr. Maldonado was for the Dispatch. I believe he is actually a reporter for the Daily Record.\n\n\n   I believe you testified in your deposition that after the complaint was filed, you actually spoke with Ms. Heidi Bubb quite a bit?\n\n\n   Yes, at the board meetings. Well, I don't recall whether or not I did say after suit was filed, but I'll take your word for it if it's in my deposition testimony.\n\n\n   I'm sorry, ma'am, could you --\n\n\n   I said, I don't recall whether or not I did say that I had spoken with her after suit was filed. I mean, if that's what it says in my deposition testimony, that's what I testified to at the time.\n\n\n   Let's go to Page 68 of your deposition transcript, ma'am.\n\n\n   Okay.\n\n\n   On Line 16, the question was asked, \"Can you recall generally when you spoke with her?\" And in reference of the -- if you look above, it's referring to Ms. Heidi Bubb. Can you read what your answer was on Lines 17 through 21?\n\n\n   \"She would generally approach me after the meetings. Especially after the complaint was filed, I spoke with her a lot. She would ask me occasionally my thoughts, public comment, what I thought -- why I thought the board was doing what they were doing, those such things.\"\n\n\n   Now, back in July or August, 2004, you had communications with the National Center for Science Education?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   I believe you joined the Listserv?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And you also had a discussion with them regarding an interview with the AP?\n\n\n   It was a brief e-mail exchange, but yes.\n\n\n   Did you do that interview?\n\n\n   No, I did not.\n\n\n   Ma'am, do you understand that the statement that's going to be read to the students in the ninth-grade biology class was modified in June of 2005?\n\n\n   Yes, I do.\n\n\n   And do you understand that that modification indicated that the book Of Pandas and People would be in the library along with other resources regarding intelligent design?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   And is it your understanding that those other resources included books that are actually critical of intelligent design?\n\n\n   Yes.\n\n\n   Do you have any objection to that?\n\n\n   No, I don't.\n\n\n   Now, you testified about the harm that you've received based on these statements and the comments and the actions of the board. I'd like you to go to your deposition transcript, if you could, to Page 101.\n\n\n   Okay.\n\n\n   If you'd read from Line 16, which presents the question, until Line 2 of the next page.\n\n\n   \"Question: Is there anything else that the board has done here in connection with the curriculum change that provides a basis for your complaint? \"Answer: From what I can see from attending the board meetings, I don't know, because so much of the curriculum debate takes place at non-public meetings that I am not aware of. And when board members are questioned at meetings, they really don't answer any questions. So it gives this whole illusion of secrecy to the process, which, you know, may be a big part of the problem. It may just be a big misunderstanding.\"\n\n\n   Were you testifying truthfully when you answered that question?\n\n\n   Yes, I was.\n\n\n    No further questions, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    Redirect?\n\n\n\n    No, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    All right. Then, ma'am, we thank you. You may step down. \nThis is probably an appropriate time for us to end today. We will \ndo so by admitting the exhibits that we need to, if we need to.\n\nP46 is the York Daily Record article. I assume we're going to \nwithhold admitting that pending further proceedings. Is that right, Mr.\nHarvey?\n\n\n\n    Yes. We'll move it in after another witness, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    P56 is the witness's letter to the editor. Are you moving\nfor the admission of P56?\n\n\n\n    Yes, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    Now, you've stated an objection to that. The objection is \nnoted. You don't have to restate it. And I will note the objection. \nDo you have any additional objections you want to make to that?\n\n\n\n    Not at this time, Your Honor. That's it. \n\n\n\n    All \nright. It's admitted subject to the defendants' objection. P60 is the \nletter from School Board Member Geesey to the editor again. I think \nI noted that it was admitted. Over the objection already of the \ndefendants, we'll reaffirm that, but you can make any other objections\nyou want to on the record, but I think that was thoroughly argued \nat that time.\n\n\n\n    That's correct, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n    All right. We will reconvene a little later tomorrow, at \n9:30 a.m., because of some matters that I must attend to, and the \nsession will go longer. With everybody's indulgence, I would expect to\ngo to approximately 5 o'clock, no later than 5 o'clock tomorrow to make \nup for the time that we lose during the morning session. So we will\nstand in recess until 9:30 a.m. on Thursday. We thank you all.\n\n\n\n   (Whereupon, the proceedings were adjourned at 4:20 p.m.)\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nI hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully\nand accurately in the notes taken by me on the within proceedings \nand that this copy is a correct transcript of the same.\n\nDated in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, this 28th day of September, 2005.\n\nLori A.

OLSON, ESQ., Solicitor General, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.;\non behalf of the Respondent.\n\n\nWe'll hear argument now in Number 01-618, Eric\nEldred v. John D. Ashcroft. Mr. Lessig.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: Petitioners are\nbefore you this morning challenging Congress's 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term\nExtension Act, which extended the term of subsisting and future copyrights by 20\nyears. Petitioners submit such a blanket extension of existing terms exceeds\nCongress's power under the Copyright Clause and it violates the First Amendment.\nNow, the Government has responded to petitioners' argument in a way that betrays a\nsimple but fundamental confusion. The Government has argued as if petitioners had\nadvanced a general theory of the Copyright Clause, or a general constraint under\nwhich Congress must operate. That is a mistake. This case is about limits to an\nenumerated power. It's not about general power of Congress to exercise its copyright\nauthority. Petitioners have advanced a particular interpretation of the only express\nlimits in the Copyright Clause designed to give those limits meaning.\n\nMr. Lessig, I'll tell you what bothers me about your position,\nand that is that Congress has extended the term so often through the years, and if\nyou are right, don't we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions of time? I\nmean, this seems to be a practice that began with the very first act.\n\nJustice, we do not believe that the very first act extended\nterms at all. Speaking technically, which for a lawyer means speaking accurately,\nthe 1790 act did not extend a Federal term. The 1790 act granted a term for works\nthat already existed in precisely the pattern that the English parliament had done\nin the Statute of Anne in 1710, and that the English parliament did with monopolies,\ngeneral monopolies in the statute.\n\nBut there have been a number of extensions since. \n\nThat's right.\n\nEven if you can get over the first hurdle. \n\nThat's right. That's the important hurdle, and we'd like to\njump that first, but the other ones, Justice, you're right, in 1831 and in 1909\nCongress extended terms in a way that is inconsistent with the strongest form of the\ntest that we have advanced. Those extensions, however, were never challenged in any\ncourt and certainly not considered by this Court. \n\nWell, doesn't that itself mean something, Mr. Lessig? The fact\nthat they were never challenged, perhaps most people, and perhaps everybody felt\nthere was no basis for challenging them.\n\nWell, Mr. Chief Justice, it's absolutely true that this case\nis here because of a fundamentally important changed circumstance that makes the\nFramers' limitations on the Copyright Clause much more significant. This is the\nfirst time I can remember where this Court has been pointed to changed circumstances\nas a reason to reaffirm the Framers' values, because for most of this period, Mr.\nChief Justice, the only people who were regulated by copyright law under the\nCopyright Act would have been commercial publishers, primarily, and now for the\nfirst time the scope of this exclusive right has expanded because of the changed\ntechnology of the Internet to reach an extraordinarily broad range of creativity\nthat never would have been imagined before. Now, it's not the case that the earlier\nextensions were not questioned on constitutional grounds. In fact, Melville Nimmer,\nin the consideration of the 1976 act, suggested they were plainly under --\n\nWell, I'm talking about court challenges, not academic\nchallenges.\n\nThat's right, there is no court challenge.\n\nMr. Lessig, your theory, as I understand it, regardless of\nchanged circumstances or not, your basic theory, which on your argument would have\nbeen appropriate at any time historically, is that there has at least got to be the\npossibility of a kind of a causal connection between the extension and the promotion\nor inducement for the creation of some subsequent work, but why is that any more\nplausible a reading of the Promotion Clause than simply a reading that says the\nPromotion Clause requires that there be a general scheme in place, which overall\ntends to promote or induce, and part of one aspect of that scheme can be that the --\nthat at the discretion of Congress the period of protection is extended from time to\ntime? Why do you require -- why do you say the clause has got to be read by this\nkind of specific causation theory as opposed to a kind of systemic theory of\npromotion?\n\nJustice Souter, the reason is exactly related to the point I\nbegan with, that this is a case about limits and not about discretion. If it's not\nthe case that this Court -- \n\nNo, but that's -- I mean, that's the issue in the alternative reading.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd why is it a limit case, rather than a discretion within a\ngeneral scheme kind --\n\nThat's right. \n\n-- of clause?\n\nBecause if this Court does not adopt a reading of the form\nwe've offered, then there is no limit to the ability of Congress to extend\nsubsisting terms.\n\nDo you say the same thing for scope? This case is about\nduration, but Congress from time to time -- in fact, you mentioned --\n\nYes.\n\n-- the expanded applications of copyright, and Congress itself\nextends the scope from time to time.\n\nWould you make, as far as, say, translation rights that didn't\nexist before, the same argument?\n\nI -- \n\nWhy -- or -- and if you wouldn't, why not? \n\nI -- no, Justice Ginsburg, we would not, and the reason is\nagain related to the method we have adopted to interpret \"limited times.\" We have\nnot said that \"promote the progress of science\" is a general and independent\nconstraint on the Copyright Clause authority. We've said it must be looked to to\ninterpret the scope of \"limited times,\" and unless retrospective extensions are\nforbidden, it will eviscerate the meaning of \"limited times.\" That does not occur in\nthe context of the scope of exclusive right, nor in the context of the power to\nsecure. If that's -- \n\nCould we then go back to Justice O'Connor's question? To make\nthat very specific, if we agree with you, does that mean that we would, in\nprinciple, have to hold the 1976 extension unconstitutional? I mean, in 1976,\nCongress extended the term from 28 years renewable once, to life of the author plus\n50 years. Now they're extending it life of the author plus 70. If the latter is\nunconstitutional on your theory, how could the former not be? And if the former is,\nthe chaos that would ensue would be horrendous.\n\nJustice Breyer, under our theory as we've advanced it, you're\nright; the 1976 act would be unconstitutional. Whether this Court would apply such a\nholding in this case to that act is a question that would have to be resolved under\nthe retrospective -- \n\nMaybe we ought to find another theory, then. Is there any\n--\n\nJustice, the theory, which would advance the aim of limiting\ntimes in a way that is enforceable, is only applicable in the case that we brought\nbefore you here to the '98 act, and would not necessarily be applicable under the\n'76 act for the reasons the Government has offered. We would not advance this\nargument, but the Government has offered an argument in a parallel case that\nsuggests a distinction between the '76 act and this case. That's not been briefed\nhere. It's been grounded in their claim that the treaty power creates some special\npower. We wouldn't advance that claim, but the point is there are a number of issues\nthat the '76 act -- \n\nIn essence, you think it's at least arguable that the '76 act\nhad various positive aspects to it in terms of the purpose of the Copyright Clause\nthat this act lacks?\n\nThat's certainly true, and we also believe that, for the\nreasons averted to by amicus AOL in this case and the reasons you've just suggested,\nthe disruption in that context under the retrospectivity cases Ryder and\nReynoldsville Casket Company would be sufficient to fit it within the, quote,\n\"severe disruption exception\" to the retrospectivity.\n\nWell, I suppose implicit in the argument that the '76 act,\ntoo, should have been declared void, and that we might leave it alone because of the\ndisruption, is that for all these years the act has impeded progress in science and\nthe useful arts. I just don't see any empirical evidence for that. \n\nJustice, we are not making an empirical claim at all. Nothing in our\nCopyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding progress. \nOur only argument is, this is a structural limit necessary to assure that what would \nbe an effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the copyright laws.\n\nWell, perhaps I misunderstood. I thought the whole thrust of\nyour is a great First Amendment force silenced, that's being thwarted. \n\nWell, the thrust certainly --\n\nI thought\nthat's the whole underpinning of your case.\n\nIt's certainly the case that we are asserting, in light of the changed circumstances,\nthat the opportunity to build upon works within the public domain is a fundamental\nFirst Amendment interest, and that the First Amendment values, vital speech interest\nat stake of this case, is that the public domain be permitted as a source for\ncultivating work about our culture without unnecessary legal restriction. \n\nWell, but you want more than that. You want the right to copy\nverbatim other people's books,don't you? \n\nWe want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in\nthe public domain and would be in the public domain but for a statute that cannot be\njustified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under a proper reading of the\nlimits built into the Copyright 16 Clause.\n\nMr. Lessig, on your First Amendment argument I don't see where\nthe retroactivity-prospectivity comes in, because -- I follow your argument under\nthe Copyright Clause, but if you're saying that the time is too long, the public\ndomain should get this stuff sooner rather than later, would you explain to me how\nyour prospectivity-retrospective line fits into your First Amendment claim? MR.\nLESSIG: Justice, we've argued that it would be inappropriate in this case for the\nCourt to consider the prospective line until they decide whether the case, whether\nthe prospective and retrospective is severable, and we submit it's an easy case to\nshow that it's not.\n\nOn the First Amendment --\n\nYes.\n\n-- argument you're making that as, I take it, an argument\nindependent of, it doesn't hang on your Copyright Clause argument.\n\nThat's right. I --\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd so let's just take -- let's say that was your only\nargument in this case. How does that tie into a retrospective-prospective\ndistinction?\n\nWell, the strongest First Amendment argument is about the\nretrospective extension, because of a fundamental change that occurs when Congress\nextends subsisting copyrights, rather than when Congress legislates prospectively.\nWhen Congress legislates prospectively, it has no way to know who's going to benefit\nfrom its extension. It is simply evaluating what the term should be prospectively in\na way that we presume this Court should presume is legitimate under the First\nAmendment. When it legislates retrospectively, it is, in effect, looking at\nparticular authors and estates of authors who are before Congress asking for this\nextension, and it's choosing between these particular authors and the public at\nlarge. Now, it may be that in exercising that choice in this case, Congress made an\nobjective valuation of who would be in the best position to advance the interests of\npromoting the progress of science, or any original -- \n\nBut you -- under your intermediate scrutiny test we would not\nbe hypothesizing what might have been in Congress's mind. Your First Amendment test\nis a stringent one. You have to have an important purpose, and the means that you\nuse is necessarily tied to that purpose. If you take that position, I don't see how\nyou make the retroactive-prospective line work.\n\nWell, the line comes from deciding what the First Amendment\ninterest is, and if this Court heed the First Amendment interest off of this\ndifference between selecting who gets the benefit of 20 years of extension and just\nsimply legislating in a general way prospectively, then this Court could hold, with\nrespect to the prospective, that it's not even necessary to raise the intermediate\nscrutiny in that context, but again, for Ashwander reasons we don't think that this\nCourt should address the prospective aspect of the CTEA even under the First\nAmendment. \n\nEven though Congress's pattern has been to treat all authors\nequally? I mean, the reason that it's been prospective and retrospective is that\npeople should be, people who hold copyrights should be subject to the same regime\nand not have some people who got their copyrights the week before the law passed\ntreated differently than people who got it the week after.\n\nWell, Justice, that certainly is the reason the Government\noffers for this pattern. It, of course, doesn't explain actually what Congress has\ndone and, even in this case, when a work has passed into the public domain, then\nthere is precisely the same week before/week after problem that you advert to, that\nextension does not extend to all subsisting works, it only extends to all subsisting\ncopyrights. So that line is already drawn in the practice that Congress has adopted,\nbut our point is, the only way to assure --\n\nBut Congress has -- or, you're not disputing that Congress has\nalways made these extensions, both retroactive and prospective?\n\nWell, in 1831 it did not. In 1831 it granted the benefit of\nits extension to a subset of all subsisting copyright holders. \n\nLet's stick with 1976.\n\nIn 1976 -- \n\nBecause that was what you said -- that's -- the pattern under\nthe CTEA is identical to the one in the '76 act.\n\nThat's absolutely right, yes. So they have extended it to\nboth. But our argument is, unless this Court draws a line about this extension, then\nfor the reasons Judge Sentelle suggested below, there will be no limit to Congress's\nability to -- \n\nJudge Sentelle did not deal with the First Amendment, as far\nas I --\n\nThat's right. \n\n-- recall. \n\nThat's right. \n\nAnd so I'm asking you -- perhaps I'm missing it. I haven't seen\nwhere you get the prospective-retrospective in connection with your First Amendment.\nIt seems that you're just saying there that 70 years is an unreasonable -- is not necessary.\n\nYes. \n\nAnd it doesn't serve an important purpose.\n\nPrecisely--actually, we're not saying anything about the 70 years in this case even\nunder the First Amendment, because we believe it's unseverable, but --\n\nBut I thought you were saying that if you accept the Copyright\nClause argument, then you have a way, in effect, of devaluing the Government's claim\nof its important interest and important objective when you get to the First\nAmendment intermediate scrutiny analysis. Whereas if you don't accept the Copyright\nClause claim, then, in order to make the First Amendment analysis we've simply got\nto say, well, gee, is the promotion of useful art and so on more important than the\npublic domain, and can we say that that allows a distinction between 50 years and 70\nyears? We're pretty much at sea, so I thought your Copyright Clause argument was\nnecessary to give us some handle with which to deal with the First Amendment. \n\nOur Copyright Clause argument is certainly a way of framing\nwhy extensions of subsisting terms cannot be seen to promote the First Amendment\ninterest of speech at all. \n\nOkay. Let's assume we don't -- for the sake of argument here,\nlet's assume we don't accept the Copyright Clause argument. Do you have an\nindependent First Amendment argument in your brief? \n\nYes, of course we do. \n\nOkay, and it is -- tell me in a sentence or two what it is. I\nmean, at that point I'm where Justice Ginsburg is.\n\nYes. The First Amendment argument we've argued in our brief\nis with respect to the retrospective extension, and the First Amendment argument is,\nthat needs to --\n\nNo, but that's the Copyright Clause argument, and it seems to\nme you're saying, okay, we then apply that in First Amendment analysis, which allows\nus to make a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument. If we don't accept the\nCopyright Clause retrospectivity argument --\n\nYes. \n\n-- then what is your First Amendment argument?\n\nThat's right, I'm sorry, Justice. What I'm saying is not that\nit's the retrospectivity that makes the First Amendment argument troubling -- I\nmean, that drives our First Amendment argument. All I'm saying is, we have addressed\nthe retrospective portion of CTEA, and so I'm saying in the retrospective portion of\nCTEA you would apply ordinary, intermediate First Amendment review, and you would\nask --\n\nWell, this Court really has not -- if you say that the\nCopyright Clause is not violated, I don't think there are examples where this Court\nhas then resorted to First Amendment analysis to invalidate the same act.\n\nWell --\n\nI mean, this would be quite a new proposition.\n\nWell, Justice O'Connor, the First Amendment is always an\nindependent limitation on what otherwise would be legitimate exercises of\ncongressional authority, so this --\n\nYes, but the Framers seem adopted these two things at the same\ntime --\n\nThat's right.\n\n-- in effect. \n\nThat's right, and if -- \n\nAnd I think there are not to have examples that I can think of\nwhere we have said, well, we'll analyze it under the Copyright Clause, but if that\nfails we'll turn to the First Amendment.\n\nJustice, that's right. If only we had the Framers' copyright\nbefore us, because of course, again remember,the exclusive right the Framers spoke\nof was the right to print and publish. It didn't include the derivative rights, it\ndidn't include the display rights, and it certainly --\n\nRight. It has expanded very much, and they also envisioned a\nvery short term, and I can find a lot of fault with what Congress did here -- \n\nThat's right.\n\n-- because it does take a lot of things out of the public\ndomain that one would think that someone in Congress would want to think hard\nabout.\n\nThat's right.\n\nBut having done that, it's very difficult to find the basis in\nthe Constitution for saying it isn't a limited term. It's longer than one might\nthink desirable --\n\nRight.\n\n-- but is it not limited?\n\nWell, if it is limited, then there is no limit to the ability\nof Congress to extend subsisting terms, and that fundamentally destroys the\nobjective that the --\n\nThe rule against perpetuities might jump in there at some\npoint.\n\nRight, and we submit the Framers had something very different\nin mind than the rule against perpetuities. The point is, if this is permitted, then\nthere is no limit to the ability to extend terms, and that is precisely contrary to\nwhat the Framers had in mind when they worried about this problem originally. What\nwas the problem they were solving? It was, as this Court stated in Graham --\n\nWell, I could agree with you, in terms of policy, that this\nflies directly in the face of what the Framers had in mind, absolutely. But does it\nviolate the Constitution?\n\nWell, if it flies in the face of what the Framers had in\nmind, then the question is, is there a way of interpreting their words that gives\neffect to what they had in mind, and the answer is yes.\n\nWell, you know, certainly what is happening in the country\ntoday in the way of congressional -- under the Commerce Clause is totally different\nthan what the Framers had in mind, but we've never felt that that was the criterion.\nWhat the Framers thought of, there weren't steamboats, there weren't\nrailroads.\n\nThat's right.\n\nWe've said there was a general grant, and that Congress was\nfree to run with it in many respects.\n\nIn many respects, Mr. Chief Justice, but, as this Court has\nalso said, there are limits to what Congress can do under the Commerce\nClause.\n\nBut isn't --\n\nCan I ask you about one of the limits, just focusing on the\nCopyright Clause and the progress of science and useful arts? In your view, does\nthat -- is that limited to encouraging creativity by authors and inventors, or does\nit also include the distribution of materials that might not otherwise be\ndistributed, like old films and so forth? \n\nWe're happy to adopt a broader interpretation of what promote\nthe progress is about, within the general framework that the Framers established in\nlight of the English practice, which was a quid pro quo. The ability to facilitate\ndistribution -- \n\nSo that if the quid pro quo is that we can facilitate\ndistribution of some old film by an additional monopoly grant, you'd think that's\npermissible?\n\nSo long as the grant is conditioned upon the distribution. So\nlong as the grant --\n\nIn other words you could have -- right now, if Congress\ndecides to have a law, and this law is going to give copyrights in 1) the Bible, 2)\nShakespeare, 3) Ben Jonson, and the reason they do it is that they think that that\nwould lead publishers to produce those and distribute them, and they're right, they\nwill, okay? In your view, that's perfectly constitutional?\n\nNo, that's the view of the Government's, Justice Breyer. My\nview is --\n\nWell, I thought that was the question you were getting, and I\nthought you were saying -- I must have misunderstood. I thought you were saying that\nwas constitutional.\n\nNo. What we were saying is, if Congress wants to permit\nrestoration of films, for example, an issue that's been well briefed here, Congress\ncan say, if you restore the film, then the restoration gets a copyright so long as\nit satisfies originality as outlined in Feist, and it gets a copyright for a period\nof time. But this Court's opinion in Graham and in Feist made clear that it could\nnot extend copyrights to works in the public domain. The Government doesn't concede\nthat, but we stand on that as a way of understanding why this Court --\n\nSo your answer to Justice Stevens is no, they cannot give a\ncopyright purely for purposes of dissemination to publishers, is that right?\n\nNo. \n\nOh, all right. \n\nThey cannot give a copyright purely for purposes of\ndistribution to publishers. (\n\nThey would need to satisfy all of the implied limitations\nthat this Court has expressed in the context of this, the most carefully limited\nclause in Article I, section 8. It is one of the --\n\nMr. Lessig, the clause says, Congress shall, and suppose\nCongress decides in this expanded world of ours that it's going to make certain\nchanges and other changes from our treaty partners. Suppose it well, the Germans led\nthe fight for 70 years in the European Union, we'll go with that, but we're going\ndemand says,fair use. Now, why couldn't that fit within the promotion of\nknowledge?\n\nJustice Ginsburg, we have no quarrel with the objective of\nharmonization fitting within the \"promote the progress of science\" understanding\nsubject to constitutional limitations. If France adopted a rule that said you\ncouldn't grant copyrights to hate speech, we could not harmonize with that rule\nconsistent with our First Amendment and similarly, as Mary Beth Peters testified\nbefore Congress, ours is the only Constitution that has an express limitation on\nterms. That's got to mean something, and if it means that we are limited in our\nability to agree with the Europeans as they continually expand the term in light of\ntheir own vision of what copyright is about, then that's the meaning of a\nconstitutional restriction. This Court's interpretation of \"limited times\" could, of\ncourse, eviscerate that term of any meaning, but under the principle of enumeration\nas this Court has articulated it, this Court should interpret that clause in a way\nthat gives its terms effect in a simple way. Just as a limited addition print is not\na limited -- is not limited if each time a customer comes in a new print is printed,\nso, too, a limited term is not limited if each time copyright holders come to\nCongress they can extend the term.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThe analogy doesn't seem to work.\n\nThat's right. All that I'm suggesting is, here is a plain\nmeaning of the term that gives effect to the constitutional limit in a way that\nassures that, in fact, the limit is respected, contrary to the Government's\nargument, which, in effect, permits Congress the power perpetually to extend terms.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time. \n\nVery well, Mr. Lessig. General Olson, we'll hear from\nyou.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The\nquestions today, especially the initial questions, suggest one of the many\ninsurmountable obstacles to petitioners' petition in, position in this case. That is\nthat the first Congress explicitly gave copyright protection to the authors of any\nbooks already printed as well as explicitly the owners of existing copyrights.\nThereafter, in 1831, 1909, 1976, and 1998, and in numerous private copyright bills\nand temporary extensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law revisions,\nCongress extended the terms of Federal copyright and patent protection of subsisting\nworks. As this Court explained 100 and some years ago in its Burrows-Giles opinion,\nsuch constructions are accorded very great weight and, as that Court went on to say,\nwhen consistent and unchallenged for over a century are almost conclusive that\nconsistent construction by Congress of its authority under the Copyright and Patent\nClause now has lasted from the 105th -- from the first through the 105th Congress.\nIt has been sustained by Justices of this Court and early decisions of this Court.\nIt is consistent with what the law of England was from the Statute of Anne --\n\nYes, but take one of the early extensions, just extending a --\nan already granted patent to an inventor for an extra 10 years. How can that be\nsquared with the language of the provision? Maybe Congress did it, but maybe it\nacted improperly when it did it.\n\nWell, the Congress -- \n\nAnd that's our question, really. \n\nWell, that -- it seems to me that there may be -- this is\n-- the clause itself is a very, very broad grant. It says the --\n\nDo you view it as entirely a grant, or do you think it also\ncontains limitations?\n\nWell, I think that to the extent that there may be\nlimitations, Justice Stevens, they are -- require considerable deference by this\nCourt to the judgment of Congress --\n\nWell, I understand that, but do you -- I'd be interested in\nknowing, do you think it does contain limitations?\n\nIt contains -- the clause itself contains limitations,\nlimited times, authors, exclusive rights and things of that nature. I don't think --\nand the petitioners expressly disclaim the assertion that any substantive\nlimitations in the \"Promote the- Clause. What the Framers were saying is, we want to\ngive Congress the authority to promote the progress of useful arts and sciences, and\n--\n\nHow did the example we just talked about, a patentee giving an\nextra 10 years on his -- how does that promote the progress of science?\n\nWell, it may provide additional incentives for the\npatentee to exploit and promote and disseminate that particular work. With respect\nto creative works like works of art, books and that sort of thing, it 20 patentee,\nthat there was a bargain in effect between the inventor and the Government that at a\ncertain period of time it would become part of the public domain. It seems to me\nit's inconsistent with that.\n\nI'm just concentrating on our and I'm wondering how that fits\ninto the notion\n\nIt isn't inconsistent, I submit, Justice Stevens, for the\nCongress to exercise its juris -- its responsibility under this broad grant of power\nto determine that there could be many ways in which the holder of an existing right\nmay benefit the public by continuing to have that right for an additional period of\ntime, the same reason that Congress -- same reasons that Congress had when it\ncreated the right in the first place. It's not just the right --\n\nNo, the reason for the right in the first place was to\nencourage invention.\n\nWell, but I -- we submit that specifically with respect to\nthe Copyright Clause, but I think it applies to the patent portion of the clause at\nall, it isn't just the invention, it isn't just the writing of the work -- and this\nrelates to the questions that were asked of my colleague a moment ago. It includes\nthe dissemination of the work, not necessarily --\n\nDissemination alone?\n\nNot necessarily the dissemination alone --\n\nWell, no, not -- don't say not necessarily. I'm -- for\npurposes of my thinking about it, I'd like to know, imagine we have just\ndissemination.\n\nThat something is already in the\n\nThat's correct. The only justification for the extension,\nthere is no other, is dissemination of a work that is already in existence.\n\nI would not want to rule that out, Justice Breyer, for the\nvery reason --\n\nWell, I want to say, do you think yes or no?\n\nWell, I think that it could very well be yes, for the\nreason that in the 1790 statute the Congress specifically was aware of -- that there\nwere State copyright laws which didn't last as long as the Federal statute. Several\nof the States hadn't finished enacting those copyright laws, and a couple of States\nhadn't enacted them at all.\n\nSo in your opinion, in my example, if you recall it --\n\nIt's --\n\n-- your answer would be, if Congress tomorrow wants to give a\ncopyright to a publisher solely for the purpose of reproducing and disseminating Ben\nJonson, Shakespeare, it can do it?\n\nIt may --\n\nI hate to say may --\n\nWell --\n\n-- because that really -- that's an important question.\n\nWell, because I don't think that a per -- I don't think\nthere is a per se rule that should apply here because this is a grant of Congress,\nto Congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial. There may be\nother constitutional provisions that come into play, or there may be other existing\n--\n\nAll right, let me explain to you why it's important to me. I\nhave a list. This is an economic statute. The harms that seem to be caused by it,\nthe extension, I've listed as follows, approximate numbers, made up, but magnitude\ncorrect. The existing copyright holders who survive, their copyright survives 70\nyears, who have already been paid, on the numbers that were given, about $24 billion\nor more, will receive an extra $6 billion. That, I take it, is a harm. Their works\nhave already been created. Harm number 2. The fact that people, for the 99 percent\nof the copyrights that have no commercial value after 70 years, have to find the\ncopyright holder to put them in databases. The cost of that, on my numbers in here,\nmade up, at least a billion dollars, or they can't find the people at all and get\npermission, an innumerable cost, un -- valuable cost to people who want to use it.\nThose are costs. On the plus side I see uniformity, dissemination, and -- now, you\ntell me.\n\nWell, I also see compliance with international competitive\nmarkets and the laws that are being adopted, and the incentives --\n\nUniformity. That's uniformity.\n\nWell, that's not just uniformity. It's providing incentive\nto people to publish here, as opposed to publish in Europe, where longer terms might\nbe available. There is an incentive to distribute existing works that may be\nnecessary. It's the consistency that Congress is promoting by saying to individuals,\nas they might have said when they enacted the Copyright Clause in the first place,\nwe will not only give you 14 years, but if we change our mind tomorrow, and think\nthat a better, a longer period is necessary, we're -- this is consistency, but it's\nalso a matter of fairness, and it's -- \n\nWhy -- on the last point, it's -- I've counted that as zero.\nThe reason I've counted it as zero is it seems to me that the added value, incentive\nvalue to produce between life plus 50, or life plus 70, is zero. It's carried out,\nas the economists do, to three decimal points, divide by 100 for the probability of\nyour ever having such a work, and you get virtually zero, no difference between this\nand a perpetual copyright.\n\nWell, I think that that's a very good illustration of why\nthe authority is granted to Congress, because if you are an 80-year-old writer, that\nmay make a considerable difference in terms of what you decide to do.\n\nHow could it?\n\nIt may -- because you may -- if you have no incentive, if\nyou know that go into the public domain sooner rather affect your judgment with\nrespect to --\n\nIn -- I --this is going to than later, it may\n\nIt might also publisher -- what the publisher pays for\nyour prospective work, Justice Breyer. We -- the Copyright Clause incentive provides\nincentives not just for -- not just to the creators, but to the disseminators, the\npublishers, the broadcasters, the film companies.\n\nSo you think, say, Verdi, Othello, Verdi, Othello, 80 years\nold, the prospect of an extra 20 years way down the pike would have made a\ndifference?\n\nWell, I think again that illustrates why the authority is\nvested in Congress to make these judgments rather than in courts to make these\naffect whether the judgments, because we're not talking about the effect on an\nindividual author, or an individual creator. What the Framers of the Constitution\nwere concerned about is a gross judgment with respect to what might generally\nprovide incentives to the population -- \n\nBut it is hard to understand how, if the overall purpose of\nthe Copyright Clause is to encourage creative work, how some retroactive extension\ncould possibly do that. I -- one wonders what was in the principle 13 difficult\nprinciple given to Congress and has been exercised so repeatedly out there that\nwould ever kick in?\n\nWell, that's a -- that is a question to say whether there\nis any limiting when such a broad grant of power, authority is that -- \n\nWell, if it's a limited term, as the Constitution says, is\nthere indeed any limit out there?\n\nWhat I submit -- well, first of all, even the petitioners\nacknowledge that, as far as prospective limits are concerned, that isn't a judgment\nthat this Court is being made to ask and, in fact, the petitioners acknowledge that\nit isn't a judgment that this Court should make, so the only point that the\npetitioners --\n\nWell, if Congress says we're going to grant this copyright\nindefinitely, forever --\n\nThat would seem --\n\n-- that violates the limited term, does it not?\n\nI acknowledge that. And anything that --\n\nIn Victorian England you could buy a box seat for 900 years.\nThere was serene complacency about their culture, and God bless them, but --\n\n-- I really think this is an important question and, as\nJustice O'Connor points out, if we have to ask what's the most plausible explanation\nfor this rule, to reward existing vested interest or to stimulate former new works,\nit seems to me that it's probably the former.\n\nWell -- \n\nI mean, we know that.\n\nIt is -- well, it -- let me say with respond -- in\nresponse to both of those questions, an unlimited time would violate the Copyright\nClause. Something that was the functional equivalent of an unlimited time would\nviolate the Copyright Clause, but the Framers specifically did not put in numbers.\nThey had the opportunity to do that. Thomas Jefferson suggested that a number should\nbe put in. We submit that it would be -- even -- since the petitioners don't suggest\nthat it's an appropriate function of this Court, certainly in this case, to pick a\nnumber, 133 years or something of that nature, but it is quite clear that Congress\nfrom the Statute of Anne, 1710, we have 300 years of history, of Congress thinking\nthat it continues to benefit the process, not just of the productivity, of the\ncreation of the work itself, but the dissemination of it to provide -- \n\nGeneral Olson, you say that the functional equivalent of an\nunlimited time would be a violation, but that's precisely the argument that's being\nmade by petitioners here, that a limited time which is extendable is the\nfunctionable, functional equivalent of an unlimited time, a limited time that 10\nyears from now can be extended, and then extended again, and extended again. Why --\ntheir argument is precisely that, a limited time doesn't mean anything unless it\nmeans, once you have established the limit for works that have been created under\nthat limit, that's the end.\n\nWell, the Framers had an opportunity to say immutable,\nunalterable, unamendable. They didn't use that. They used the phrase, limited term,\nwhich means then, meant then and means now, a certain specified --\n\nOkay, assuming --\n\n-- number of years under the 5 statute.\n\nWith the exception of a limitation which illustrates the\ndistinction between forever on the one hand and a definite number on the other, is\nthere any limitation in the clause? Does the promotion, does the preambular\nrecitation of promotion as such place a limit on it?\n\nI submit, Justice Souter, that there's no per se\nlimitation, that if there is, as Justice Scalia suggested, for -- if it is true that\nCongress,having specified 14 years or 28 years, decides that doesn't work very well\nbecause of the economies of other countries, the parade of constraints on artists in\nother countries, the reasons that we want things to be preserved or distributed, it\nshould be 2 more years, or 5 more years later -- \n\nYes, but that argument would apply to new copyrights, but to\nextension of already existing copyrights your argument doesn't apply.\n\nIt does apply, Justice Stevens, because --\n\nThe work has already been created.\n\nThe work has already been created, but the artists that\nare creating works day in and day out take into consideration the fact that Congress\nhas decided, there's an ease of administration --\n\nBut for them, they get the benefit of the longer term if you\ndon't apply it to an existing copyright. I mean, if you say you need 70 years\nbecause of changes in the economy to encourage works, you grant 70 for the future,\nbut why does that, making that apply to somebody provided him?\n\nWe're not just -- because we're not just talking about the author. \nIf we -- we're talking about --\n\nThe Constitution refers to the authors and the inventors, doesn't it? \nThey're certainly the prime actors in this scene, aren't they?\n\nYes, but all of the history of the development of these\nclauses suggests that -- and this Court has indicated in its decisions with respect\nto copyright, that the Framers were concerned and the Congress is legitimately\nconcerned not just in providing the spark of creativity, but to make sure that\nthat's distributed widely and available, and there may be many reasons why -- we're -- we --\n\nAnd that it gets into the public the expiration of the term.\nThat was an part of the bargain.\n\nYes, and what -- but the \ndefinition of the term was a responsibility vested in Congress, because it has the\npower -- the legislative history of the 1998 act itself suggests what was going on\nhere and suggests why the Framers gave this authority to Congress. There were\nnumerous hearings, there were testimony by the folks that represent the same\nposition as petitioners here as to why this shouldn't be done, why it should be that\nthis done. Congress weighed -- as this Court, the phrase Court used, I think it was\nin the Feist case,the delicate balance that was so difficult for Congress\nto--\n\nHow -- \n\nOkay, but you --\n\n-- what weighs in that balance, because to go back for one\nsecond, in practical, economic terms I gather the difference between a copyright\nthat lasts for 100 years, lasts for 1,000 years, lasts forever, is probably\nsomething less than 1,000 -- on $1,000 a penny. I mean, it's a penny on 1,000, or\nprobably a lot less than that, frankly. So I can not only not imagine a person whose\ndecision to write would be governed by such a thing, I cannot imagine a European who\nwould come to America to copyright his work for such a reason. Indeed, I wonder why\nthat European wouldn't come anyway, even if the term were 10 years, because if he\ndoesn't come, he's not going to get protection.\n\nWell, the --\n\nI mean, who are these people that are going to be moved by\nthat incentive?\n\nThe -- as we described in our brief, in pages 34 through\n36, I believe it is in our brief, that the concerns about the limitation on\nexploitation and the limitation of a copyright period in Europe is based upon the\ncountry of origin of the work and the shortest time available. So that there may be\ndifferences, and we describe that, but that illustrates, Justice Breyer, the\ndifference between 1 cents and 10 cents and $100 with respect to this particular\nauthor who's this particular age, or a particular author like Melville, whose works\nweren't -- weren't -- didn't -- or Schubert, whose works weren't properly\nappreciated or exploitable until many years after their death. All of these\nvariations are quintessentially legislative judgments. It would be very difficult\nfor the Framers to have eschewed deciding 14 years was a constitutional limitation,\nand for this Court to say 99 years is, and again, even the petitioners aren't asking\nthe Court to make that judgment. The petitioners are only saying that there shall be\na per se rule that the word \"limited times,\" means unchangeable times.\n\nBut there has to be a limit, as you acknowledge. Perpetual\ncopyright is not permitted. Who is the judge of -- within that line? Who is the\njudge of when it becomes unlimited? Is there, in other words, judicial review and,\nif there is, what standard would this Court apply to determine whether something\nshort of perpetual is still unlimited?\n\nWell, the issue before this Court, I hasten to say, as I\nsaid before, is only whether, once the Congress makes that judgment, it can ever\nchange it retrospectively. The issue before this Court is not whether, in the\nfuture, a certain length of time would be appropriate. That -- but the answer to\nthat, Justice Ginsburg, I submit, is found in the Necessary and Proper Clause, and\nthis Court's interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause as to the extent that\nthis Court would find or not find that the judgment made by Congress with respect to\nthe implementation of this very broad power is convenient or useful in terms of the\nachievement of the 2 goals.\n\nOkay, and is your argument that we find and hold against their\nretrospective because there is some, at least plausible basis should so argument, to\nsay that there can be a causal connection between the retrospective extension and\nsome benefit that can be traced to those particular works through the retrospective\nextension, like dissemination? Is that your argument?\n\nThat is among our arguments, Justice Souter.\n\nIs it also your argument that even if you cannot trace that\nkind, or at least plausibly argue that there could be that kind of a causal benefit,\nthat it would still be constitutional, because you should judge the extension simply\nas contributing to a general system, one feature of which is that from time to time\nthere may be retrospective extensions, and so long as that general system induces\nthe creation of works, or the dissemination of works, or the preservation of works,\nso long as the general system works, there is no review, no limitation on the\ntinkering that can be done, even retrospectively? Is that also your argument?\n\nI think that's a fair statement of an argument that we\nhave made and articulated in the brief --\n\nOkay.\n\n-- that unless there is a -- the Court is -- because the\ncircumstances change, that we are living in an era now where piracy is a significant\nproblem, there's question of administrative ease, of administering a system where\ncopyrights may be different for one set of authors, or different for another set of\nauthors, there's changes that are taking place internationally, so that what we're\nsaying is that not only could this Court conceive of reasons why Congress thought it\nwas accomplishing the objectives of this clause, but that there are numerous\nobjectives that are entirely legitimate in --\n\nDo you also argue that the Necessary and Proper Clause alone\nwill justify the retroactive extension simply as a matter of equity?\n\nYes.\n\nThat is, that the Copyright Clause justifies the extension for\nworks not yet created, but it would be enormously inequitable to have other authors\nwho put in the same amount of work get a lesser protection, so the Necessary and\nProper Clause now allows you to do the 24 retrospective? \n\nYes, Justice Scalia, and the examples that are -- \n\nCan I ask you, why is it enormously inequitable if they get\nexactly what they were entitled to at the time they made the work?\n\nThe implicit promise that --\n\nI mean, they have some right to expect that they will be --\nyou know, an additional grant, later on?\n\nI think that's not an unreasonable expectation at all,\nJustice Stevens, because that was the premise of the --\n\nThat is the way it's always been done. There hasn't been any\ncopyright extension that hasn't applied to subsisting work.\n\nThat's -- \n\nBut there was one -- Justice Breyer brought up Ben Jonson, so\n-- this case doesn't involve works that are already in the public domain.\n\nThat is correct. \n\nThis is subsisting copyrights.\n\nThat is correct. \n\nSo -- \n\nBut why wouldn't it? \n\nWhy? Why not? \n\nWhy wouldn't it? If the equity argument under the Necessary\nand Proper Clause justifies extension of the copyright for those whose copyright\nwill expire tomorrow if it's not extended, in order to put them on parity with those\ngetting copyrights for new works, why doesn't it apply to the copyright, the holder\nof the copyright that expired yesterday?\n\nYou could arguably -- you could conceivably make that\nargument, Justice Souter, but there is a bright line there. Something that has\nalready gone into the public domain, which other individuals or companies or\nentities may then have acquired an interest in, or rights to, or be involved in\ndisseminating --\n\nAnd if you don't -- \n\nThis is a rational --\n\nIf you don't draw the line there, then Ben Jonson certainly\ngets recopyrighted.\n\nWell, the difficulty --\n\nIf we're just looking for a bright line, the line that they\nsuggest between unexpired patents and copyrights and brand new ones is also just as\nbright.\n\nOh, I concede that it's a bright line, but it's a bright\nline that would have --\n\nExcept Congress chose this one and didn't choose the other\none. That's --\n\nCongress --\n\nBasically you're saying the presumption ought to be in the congressional judgment\nabout how to draw the line as well as in how long a line to draw.\n\nI agree, and this Court has -- we're not just talking about the \njudgment of the Congress of the -- the 105th \nCongress in 1998. This is the way the Statute of Anne was written. This is the\nway the State copyright laws were written when this country became a Nation. This is\nthe way the 1790 copyright statute, the number of -- \n\nWell, of course, the original statute was replacing a bunch of\nState statutes or State rules, partly common law, partly statutory, that -- they had\nkind of a mixed up legal situation, and there was an interest in having one uniform\nrule for the first time around.\n\nWell, there was an interest in having a uniform rule, and\nthat's precisely why the Framers created the Copyright Clause in the Constitution,\nbut there was copyright protection in some States, there wasn't copyright protection\nin other States, and what we know from the decision of this Court in the Wheaton\ndecision is that there was not a common law copyright in existence. This Court\nexplicitly held that. Now, the petitioners make this quid pro quo to draw the line\nas well as in how long a line\n\nI agree, and this Court has -- just talking about the\njudgment of the Congress the 105th Congress in 1998. This is the way the argument\nthat somehow implicitly the initial 1790 copyright statute was saying to people, you\nget a copyright if you exchange whatever existing rights you have. That simply does\nnot make any sense. There is no language, and it's a relatively late-discovered\nargument, because it sees its full -- \n\nI want you to finish that, but I want you to go back to the --\nI have one question on the equity principle. Are you -- I want you to finish.\n\nI wasn't finished, but I'm happy to come back.\n\nGo ahead. No, no, you finish\n\nWell, I was going to say no language whatsoever of\npreemption, abandonment, abrogation, or exchange in the 1790 copyright, but compare\n-- Copyright Act. But compare that to thefirst. there's Patent Act under the same\nclause, where there is that exchange there. The other thing, as this Court has said,\nthere is no implied abrogation of common law rights which would be a doctrine which\nwould be inconsistent with what the petitioner is arguing. Now --\n\nWhy -- I mean, I think you have a point on this equity\nprinciple. I wonder, is there any review there? That is, suppose you have a statute,\nas this one arguably is, where 99.9 percent, many billions of dollars of benefits,\nare going to the existing holders of copyright on grounds of equity, and the effect\nof the statute in eliciting new works is near zero. I mean, that would seem -- where\nthis equity idea is the camel and the production idea is the gnat, and is there any\n-- can we say something like that, or does Congress have total leeway in respect to\n--\n\nWell, it --\n\n-- who they want to give the money to, basically?\n\nJustice Breyer, it's conceivable that the Court might do\nthat if that situation was present, but it's not remotely the situation here. We\nhave the adoption of copyright terms which are consistent, generally speaking, with\ncopyright terms which exist in the European Union, our principal competitor, and in\nconnection with international treaties. We have a copyright term that's consistent\nwith the concept of the creator plus the creator's first generation heirs. We have a\ncopyright term, remember, which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that\nwere added to the period between creation and publication, so that the limited\nnumber of years in the first, the 1790 and the 1831 statute were the number of years\nplus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication, so we\ndon't have anything remotely like that in this situation. We have a process which,\nas you suggested, or one of the questions suggested, is -- may not have been the\npolicy that you as a Member of Congress would have supported. You might have made\nthe balance, that delicate balance that this Court has referred to, in another way,\nbut that is something that Congress, through its ability to gather facts and make\nbalances, is quintessentially capable of doing, and that is where the Framers vested\nthe responsibility, and what this statute does is to favor, if at all, the creator\nwith respect to the utilization of these rights, as opposed to the person who wishes\nto copy the creator. That's an entirely rational distinction for Congress to make.\nThank you.\n\nThank you, General Olson. Mr. Lessig, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nGeneral Olson has been perfectly clear in setting out the\nstructure of the Government's argument. It is that there is no effective limit on\nCongress's power under the Copyright Clause. Now, were this the first time this\nCourt had considered Congress's copyright authority, that might be a plausible\nargument, but the very first time this Court ever struck down a law of Congress as\nexceeding Article I, section 8 power was in the context of the Copyright Clause. We\nhave 125 years of history of this Court making sure that the limits, both express\nand implied, in the Copyright Clause, have some meaning. The Feist opinion very\nclearly sets out the implied limits, a per se limit for originality, for the reasons\nJustice Breyer was trying to get me to say. The Harper as well as Graham set out\nvery clear limits on the context of the ability to extend works in the public\ndomain. Those limits make no sense under the reasoning the Government has offered.\nThe Government's reasoning would make all of those opinions irrelevant and wrong.\nNow, we offer a simple way to make this clear, express limit make sense, and that is\nprecisely the understanding we suggest that existed in 1790. The only precedents\nthat existed in 1790 were precedents of setting a term, and then when parliament was\nasked in 1735, '37, and '39 to extend it, they rejected it, and as amicus historians\nsaid, they rejected it because, as a pamphleteer described it, that would be\neffectively a perpetual term. Now, this delicate balance that the Government\ninvokes, Justice Breyer, let me give you the numbers. The delicate balance is that,\nunder the most reasonable assumptions of copyright royalty income and under our\ninterest rate of 7 percent, as the amicus economists note at page 6, note 6 of their\nbrief, the current term gives authors 99.8 percent of the value of a perpetual term.\nNow, that might be a delicate balance, that they give the author 99.8 percent and\nthe public .2 percent, but in my mind, that's delicate in a very different sense of\nthat term. Thank you very much.\n\nThank you, Mr. Lessig. The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)\n\n\n", "mode": "spoken", "name": "Lessig-court-transcript", "class": "court-transcript"}

Good evening, from Wake Chapel at Wake Forest University at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I'm Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. Welcome to this second election 2000 debate between the Republican candidate for president, George W. Bush of Texas, and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns. Only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. The format tonight is that of a conversation. The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always, absolute quiet, please. Good evening, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. The end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close. Governor Bush, the first question goes to you. One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single-most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power?\n I have, I have. First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? What's in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nation's interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest. I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him. He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side. One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people. I've been able to set clear goals. The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. That's what a Chief Executive Officer does. So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.\n Vice President Gore?\n Yes, Jim. I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world. I see it as a question of values. It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be. And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans. It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us. As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is America's greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws. We've got to deal with things like racial profiling. And we have to keep our military strong. We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way. But our real power comes, I think, from our values.\n Should the people of the world look at the United States, Governor, and say, should they fear us, should they welcome our involvement, should they see us as a friend, everybody in the world? How would you project us around the world, as president?\n Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed. I don't think they'll look at us with envy. It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us. And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble. And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are. We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.\n A humble nation.\n I agree with that. I agree with that. I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway. That there is some resentment of U.S. power. So I think that the idea of humility is an important one. But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about. That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong. You know, in the last, or two decades ago it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time. The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. We need to do more. But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.\n Does that give us -- does our wealth, our good economy, our power, bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world?\n Yes, it does. Take, for example, Third World debt. I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions. I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes. We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people. We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world. We can lend money but we have to do it wisely. We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials. So we have to be guarded in our generosity.\n Let's go through some of the specifics now. New question. Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East. Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there?\n The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there. The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. It's a very tense situation there. But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.\n Governor?\n Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions. Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend. I'm going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship. And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president. But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resoluting your determination. One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace is to be able to say to the Saddam Husseins of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends. It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.\n So you don't believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides and resolve this right now? A lot of people pushing hey, the United States should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation.\n Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker. And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us. And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.\n You agree with that, Governor?\n I do. I do think this, though. When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis. Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides. And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table. I will try to do the same thing. But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.\n People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy, and they are so interested they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle Middle East policy. Is there any difference?\n I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.\n That's hard to tell. I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.\n Saddam Hussein, you mean, get him out of there?\n I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well. We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. He is a danger. We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.\n You feel that is a failure of the Clinton administration?\n I do.\n Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power. I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it. I don't think they should be allowed to.\n Did he state your position correctly, you're not calling for eliminating the sanctions, are you?\n No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.\n Let's go on to Milosevic and Yugoslavia, and it falls under the area of our military power. Governor, new question. Should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. military intervention?\n I think it's a triumph. I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia. I supported them when they did so. I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made. I'm pleased the president made the decision he made. Because freedom to go in that part of the world, and where there's a lot of work left to be done, however.\n But you think it would not have happened -- do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a legitimate use of our military power?\n Yes, I think it is. Absolutely. I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force. And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment. I supported the president. I thought he made the right decision to do so. I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It is important for NATO to have it work. It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe. And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. Now, there's more work to do. Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one. Also on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.\n Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years. When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?\n Trying to figure out who the questioner was.\n If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took. I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident. I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.\n Well, let's stay on the subject for a moment. New question related to this. I figured this out; in the last 20 years there have been eight major actions that involved the introduction of U.S. ground, air or naval forces. Let me name them. Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo. If you had been president for any of those interventions, would any of those interventions not have happened?\n Can you run through the list again?\n Sure. Lebanon.\n I thought that was a mistake.\n Grenada.\n I supported that.\n Panama.\n I supported that.\n Persian Gulf.\n Yes, I voted for it, supported it.\n Somalia.\n Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered. I did support it at the time. It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.\n Bosnia.\n Oh, yes.\n Haiti.\n Yes.\n And then Kosovo.\n Yes.\n We talked about that. Want me to do it with you? Lebanon.\n Make a couple comments.\n Sure, absolutely, sure. Somalia.\n Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong. The mission was changed. And as a result, our nation paid a price. And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building. I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war. I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests. But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti. I wouldn't have supported either.\n What about Lebanon?\n Yes.\n Grenada.\n Yes.\n Panama?\n Yes. Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.\n I do, I do. The Persian Gulf, obviously. And Bosnia. And you have already talked about Kosovo. But the reverse side of the question, Governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. There was no U.S. intervention, no intervention from the outside world. Was that a mistake not to intervene?\n I think the administration did the right thing in that case. I do. It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda. And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation. The administration, seem like we're having a great love for us tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.\n Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide?\n I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. We tried everything else. If we have allies in the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa we did not. Now, we have tried -- our countries tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.\n So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 people's lives are at risk?\n Well, I understand, and Africa is important. And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy. We have to work with Nigeria. That's an important continent. But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere. And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity. I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. I thought that was a good model. But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim. And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world. I want to be judicious in its use. You mentioned Haiti. I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti. I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile. It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful. It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.\n Vice President Gore, do you agree with the governor's views on nation building, the use of military, our military, for nation building as he described and defined it?\n I don't think we agree on that. I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. I think we have to be very reticent about that. But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.\n You said in the Boston debate, Governor, on this issue of nation building, that the United States military is overextended now. Where is it overextended? Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you become president?\n First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said. I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy. And we can't do that. We've got to rebuild our military. But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world. And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans. I would very much like to get our troops out of there. I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. No one is suggesting that. But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground. And there is an example. Haiti is another example. Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia. I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world. The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia. But --\n The use of the military, there -- some people are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that? Is that on your radar screen?\n I don't think so. I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. Maybe I'm missing something here. I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America? Absolutely not. Our military is meant to fight and win war. That's what it's meant to do. And when it gets overextended, morale drops. I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.\n I don't disagree with that. I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. That's what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. That's really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that. And that's why I've supported building up our capacity. I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. We've had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say. But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength. And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.\n In the non-military area of influencing events around the world, the financial and economic are, the World Bank President Wilfinson said recently, Governor, that U.S. contributions to overseas development assistance is lower now almost than it has ever been. Is that a problem for you? Do you think -- what is your -- what is your idea about what the United States' obligations are? I'm talking about financial assistance and that sort of thing to other countries, the poor countries.\n Well, I mentioned Third World debt.\n Sure.\n That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations. I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid. I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently. One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation. I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out. It needs to be available for emergency situations. I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico. But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves. So I'll look at every place where we're investing money. I just want to make sure the return is good.\n Do you think we're meeting our obligations properly?\n No, I would make some changes. I think there need to be reforms in the IMF. I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable. And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF. The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. I've worked on this issue. It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it. And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. The world has come together, as I said, they're looking to us. And we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.\n Let me comment on that. I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. We can help. And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government. I want to empower the people. I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. I think we can help. I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. They're going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you. Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.\n Lets move on. No, let's move on.\n Far be it from me to suggest otherwise. \n First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week. Vice President Gore, would you support or sign, as president, a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government?\n Yes, I would. The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know it's been going on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years. But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. And I was surprised at the extent of it. And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. And it's not an easy problem to solve. But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.\n Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed. That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about. And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling. One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces. I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs decisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job. I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced. I don't think they ought to be held guilty. But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done. And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.\n And that could be a federal law?\n Yeah.\n And you would agree?\n I would agree. And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also. I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training. And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations. And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America. And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas. And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity. And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law. I think these crimes are different. I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.\n You have a different view of that.\n No, I don't, really.\n On hate crimes laws?\n No. We've got one in Texas. And guess what? The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them? They're going to be put to death. A jury found them guilty. It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death. And it's the right cause. It's the right decision. Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence. People are stopped, and we have to do something about that. My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect. So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces. It's an issue throughout our society. And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more. I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care. They're tolerant people. They're good, tolerant people. It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.\n What -- if you become president, Governor, are there other areas, racial problem areas, that you would deal with as president involving discrimination? Like you said, Arab-Americans, but also Hispanics, Asians, as well as Blacks in this country.\n Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes. In public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. She's right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read. K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if they're not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.\n Vice President Gore, what would be on your racial discrimination elimination list as president?\n Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws. I think we still need affirmative action. I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position. The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also. But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.\n Hold on one second. What is the misunderstanding? Let's clear this up.\n Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support. Am I wrong about that?\n Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute? We do. GORE: I'm talking about the one that was proposed to deal --\n No -- well, what the Vice President must not understand is we've got a hate crimes bill in Texas. And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment. The death penalty.\n They were prosecuted under the murder laws, were they not, in Texas?\n In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim. The crime is hate. And they got the ultimate punishment. I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty. We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.\n May I respond?\n Sure.\n I don't want to jump in. I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee. There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed. And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy. There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others. And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.\n And you would support that bill.\n Absolutely.\n Would you support a national hate crimes law?\n I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version. But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books. That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee. But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime. And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime. And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to deaths. And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.\n New subject, new question. Another vice presidential debate follow-up. Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships. What's your position on that?\n I'm not for gay marriage. I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act. I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now. But I think marriage is a sacred institution. I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me. I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas. I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view. But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.\n Vice President Gore?\n I agree with that, and I did support that law. But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman. And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.\n Is that right?\n I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me. I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people. I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't. I'm not sure where he's coming from. But I will be a tolerant person. I've been a tolerant person all my life. I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.\n Do you believe in general terms that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as other Americans?\n Yes. I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.\n Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. I strongly support it. What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian. And it would be a federal law preventing that. Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress. I wonder if the Governor who lend his support to that law.\n Governor?\n The question --\n Well, but it's a logical response.\n Well, I have no idea. I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law. I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation. As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further. I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life. And I think that's a private matter. And I think that's the way it ought to be. But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.\n Special rights, how does that affect gays and lesbians?\n Well, it would be if they're given special protective status. That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.\n New subject, new question, Vice President Gore. How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns?\n Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed. But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem. So I favor closing the gun show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. That's still pending. If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years. I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate. I think that we ought to make all schools gun free. Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. I think that measures like these are important. Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.\n Governor?\n Well, it starts with enforcing law. When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you. If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I'm going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them. That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that. An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.\n All right. So on guns, somebody wants to cast a vote based on your differences, where are the differences?\n Well, I'm not for registration. I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.\n What's that mean?\n A photo license I.D. like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --\n Excuse me, you would have to get the license -- a photo I.D. to go in and before you could buy the gun?\n Correct.\n All right. Who would issue the --\n The state. The state. I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns. There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records. And the \"Los Angeles Times\" spent a lot of ink going into that. But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns. I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.\n Back to the question about the differences on gun control. What are they, Governor, from your point of view, between you and the Vice President?\n Well, I'm not for photo licensing. Let me say something about Columbine. Listen, we've got gun laws. He says we ought to have gun-free schools. Everybody believes that. I'm sure every state in the union has got them. You can't carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. It's really a matter of culture. It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life? So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law. But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law. But there's a larger law. Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.\n I also believe in the Golden Rule. And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said. We do have a serious problem in our culture. Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children. She's worked on it longer than I have. But I feel very strongly about that. And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that. But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting. But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.\n Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. We're tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained. And that's what needs to happen. We've got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.\n New question. As I was saying. Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now? What would you do about that?\n Well, I've got a plan to do something about that. It's to make health care affordable and available this way. First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to. There's some --\n Some of the 40 million.\n Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now. For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity. In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do. One, we need more community health centers. I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country. These are places where people can get primary care. Secondly -- and they're good. They're very important parts of the safety net of health care. Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets. It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system. If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power. And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down. I think that's the very best way to go. It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.\n Vice President Gore?\n It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years. I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system. In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government. I want a smaller and smarter government. I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years. And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the \"Los Angeles Times\" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years. So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people. But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country. I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance. So it's one of my top priorities. Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this. And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here. And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care. 49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care. So it is a priority for me. I guarantee you. I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that. I think it ought to be a top priority.\n Governor, did the -- are the vice president's figures correct about Texas?\n First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system? I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system. It was fortunately stopped in its tracks. Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President. It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long. But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union. And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program. For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state. You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas. We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.\n Is he right?\n Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct. And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered. And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests. He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program. There's -- you don't have to take my word for this. There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this. I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance. 600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.\n Let's let the governor respond to that. Are those numbers correct? Are his charges correct?\n If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong. We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people. And they get health care. Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care. But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased. He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population. And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd. Let me just tell you who the jury is. The people of Texas. There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me. And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person. So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around. I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right. We come together both Republicans and Democrats.\n Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. The reason you brought this up, is it -- are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president?\n Yes, yes. But it's not a statement about his heart. I don't claim to know his heart. I think he's a good person. I make no allegations about that. I believe him when he says that he has a good heart. I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person. But I think it's about his priorities. And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better? I would. Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim. Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined. According to his own numbers. So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know. It's a question of priorities and values. See, you know --\n Let me ask --\n First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course. And secondly, I repeat to you --\n What is not true, Governor?\n That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. The top -- let's talk about my tax plan. The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief. We just have a different point of view. It's a totally different point of view. He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. We pay 4.7 billion. I can't emphasize to you how much. I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session. We're working hard to sign up children. We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state. We're making really good progress. And our state cares a lot about our children. My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. They have not done it. They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare. And they have not got it done. And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. The horse is up there now. But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for American.\n New question, new subject. Vice President Gore, on the environment. In your 1992 book you said, quote, \"We must make the rescue of our environment the central organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet.\" Do you still feel that way?\n I do. I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming. There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years. Already people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes. And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. Now, here is the good news, Jim. If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market. Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living. And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time. I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated. We have to be bold. We have to provide leadership. Now it's true that we disagree on this. The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people. He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country. And Texas is number one in industrial pollution. We have a very different outlook. And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.\n Governor?\n Well, let me start with Texas. We are a big industrial state. We reduced our industrial waste by 11%. We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them. Our water is cleaner now.\n Explain what a brown field is to those who don't follow this.\n A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers. And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now. I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. I think we need to have clean coal technologies. I propose $2 billion worth. By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there. We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas. No excuses. You must conform. In other words, there are practical things we can do. But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks. If you own the land, every day is Earth Day. People care a lot about their land and care about their environment. Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.\n Where do you see the basic difference in very simple terms in two or three sentences between you and the governor on the environment? If a voter wants to make a choice, what is it?\n I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming. He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes. I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies. And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that. We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said. We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary. I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way. We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.\n Would you say it's a fundamental difference?\n I think it's a fundamental difference. Let me give you an example.\n Hold on one second.\n Okay, sure.\n We've talked about supply. I just want to know for somebody -- we're getting close to the end of our time here. If somebody wanted to vote on the environment, how would you draw the differences, Governor?\n Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C. I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels. And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it. The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President. That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities. I think there's a difference. I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --\n That was out in the west?\n Out in the west, yeah. And so -- on the logging issue. That's not the way I would have done it. Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside. But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.\n Would you believe the federal government still has some new rules and new regulations and new laws to pass in the environmental area or do you think --\n Sure, absolutely, so long as they're based upon science and they're reasonable. So long as people have input.\n What about global warming?\n I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously. But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet. And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions. I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air. Like Kyoto Treaty would have done. China and India were exempted from that treaty. I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.\n Global warming, the Senate did turn it down. I think --\n 99 to nothing.\n Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded. But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate. I'm not for command and control techniques either. I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with. But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming. I think that we do. It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this. Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable. What are we going to tell our children? I'm a grandfather now. I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm. In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, \"Where your heart is, there is your treasure also.\" And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.\n Yeah, I agree. I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming? A profound scientist recently made a different --\n Both of you have now violated -- excuse me. Both of you have now violated your own rules. Hold that thought.\n I've been trying so hard not to.\n I know, I know. But under your alls rules you are not allowed to ask each other a question. I let you do it a moment ago.\n Twice.\n Now you just -- twice, sorry. \n That's an interruption, by the way.\n That's an interruption, okay. But anyhow, you just did it so now --\n I'm sorry. I apologize, Mr. Vice President.\n You aren't allowed to do that either, see?  I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your thought. People care about these things I've found out.\n Of course they care about them. Oh, you mean the rules.\n Yeah, right, exactly right. Go ahead.\n What the heck. I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously. But science, there's a lot -- there's differing opinions. And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place. And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment. We may have different approaches. We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks. I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input. And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place. I feel very strongly the same place. It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.\n New question. Last question. For you, Governor. And this flows somewhat out of the Boston debate. You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etcetera. Are you -- do you believe these are serious issues? This is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on November 7?\n Well, we all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean. I think credibility is important. It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider. This isn't something new. I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims. I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen. I mention the last debate --\n EITC?\n The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry.\n That's all right.\n A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it? Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't. And so I think this is an issue. I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package. I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers. But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue. And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations. Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package. That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case. And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions. That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.\n Vice President Gore?\n I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that. And I'm going to try to do better. One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make. However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that. There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes. More sometimes than people in foreign countries. And we need to do something about that. Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over. But right away. And that means doing it under the Medicare program. I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong. I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard. But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.\n Does that resolve the issue, Governor?\n That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?\n Does it resolve it for you?\n Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.\n Your folks are saying some awful things.\n I hope they're not awful things. I think they may be using the man's own words.\n Well, what I mean is calling him a serial exaggerator --\n I don't believe I've used those words.\n No, but your campaign ads.\n Maybe they have.\n And your campaign officials have. And your campaign officials, Mr. Vice President, are now calling the governor a bumbler.\n Wait a minute. \n I mean, my point is, should this -- is this --\n I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.\n It's in your commercial.\n I understand. The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?\n You haven't seen the commercial?\n Your --\n I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy. I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.\n That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about. \n Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.\n Gentlemen, it's time to go to the closing statements. And Vice President Gore, you have two minutes.\n Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important. This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about. If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education. You can't do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.\n Governor Bush, two minutes.\n Jim, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening. I'm running to get some things done for America. There's too many issues left unresolved. There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C. I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in today's military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military. Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue. It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage. I want to do something about Social Security. It's an important priority, because now is the time to act and we're going to say to our seniors, our promises we've made to you will be promises kept. But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. And finally, I do believe in tax relief. I believe we can set our priorities. I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. I believe in limited government. By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills. I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can. Thank you for listening. I'm asking for your vote, and God bless.\n And we will return next Tuesday night, October 17th, from Washington University in St. Louis for the third and final debate. Thank you, Vice President Gore, Governor Bush. See you next week. For now, from Winston-Salem, I'm Jim Lehrer, thank you and good night.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "spoken", "name": "2nd_Gore-Bush", "class": "debate-transcript"}

BUSH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nU. S. SENATOR JOHN F. KERRY (MA) DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE \nBOB SCHIEFFER CBS ANCHOR\n \n Good evening from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News. I want to welcome you to the third and last of the 2004 debates between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. \nAs Jim Lehrer told you before the first one, these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. \nTonight the topic will be domestic affairs, but the format will be the same as that first debate. I'll moderate our discussion under detailed rules agreed to by the candidates, but the questions and the areas to be covered were chosen by me. I have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are. \nTo refresh your memory on the rules, I will ask a question. The candidate is allowed two minutes to answer. His opponent then has a minute and a half to offer a rebuttal. \nAt my discretion, I can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional 30 seconds. \nA green light will come on to signal the candidate has 30 seconds left. A yellow light signals 15 seconds left. A red light means five seconds left. \nThere is also a buzzer, if it is needed. \nThe candidates may not question each other directly. There are no opening statements, but there will be two-minute closing statements. \nThere is an audience here tonight, but they have agreed to remain silent, except for right now, when they join me in welcoming President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. \n\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. \nBy coin toss, the first question goes to Senator Kerry. \nSenator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight. \nAnd that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up? \n Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight. \nThank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us. \nAnd thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We're proud to be here. \nMr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people. \nWill we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. That's the goal. \nNow, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it. \nI believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. \nThe measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. That's not good enough. \nPeople who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. That's not good enough. Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program. \nSo we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists. \nI will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe. \nBut I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure. \n Mr. President, you have 90 seconds. \n Thank you very much. \nI want to thank Arizona State as well. \nYes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world. \nI have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account. \nAs a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march. \nWe held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein. \nIn other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling. I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people. \nAt home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it. \nWe're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports. \nBut absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership. \n Anything to add, Senator Kerry? \n Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped. \nSix months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, \"Where is Osama bin Laden? \" He said, \"I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. I'm not that concerned. \"\nWe need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror. \n Mr. President? \n Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of one of those exaggerations. \nOf course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden. \nMy opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected. \n New question, Mr. President, to you. \nWe are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year. \nSuddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen? \n Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country. We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season. \nMy call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young. \nThe CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly. \nI haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated. \nWe have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine. \nOne of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law. \nBut the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot. \n Senator Kerry? \n This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. It's not working for the American family. And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years. \nFive million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all. \nAll across our country -- go to Ohio, 1. 4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush. \nThis president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans. \nChildren across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. \nI have a plan to cover all Americans. We're going to make it affordable and accessible. We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves. \n Mr. President, would you like to add something? \n I would. Thank you. \nI want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for. \nHe just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years. \nIt's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch. \n Time's up. \n Thank you. \n Actually, it's not an empty promise. \nIt's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice. \nWhat we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs. \nBut the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We're not giving this away for nothing. \n All right. \nSenator Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. \nMy question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? \n I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go. \nDuring the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how. \nPresident Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this. He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1. 6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. \nNow, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s. \nEvery plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those. \nAnd we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get. \nWe shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China. \nI'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education. \nI have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks. \nThis president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that. \n Mr. President? \n Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record. \nHe been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4. 2 trillion. \nHe talks about PAYGO. I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends. \nHe's proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account. \nThere is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class. \nI propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress. \n Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs. \nYou know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual. \nMr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States? \n I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college. \nWe've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. \nYou know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. \nI went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. \nAnd so we said: Let's raise the standards. We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late. \nNo, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive. \nGot four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. \nAnd so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. And that's what I would say to that person. \n Senator Kerry? \n I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally. \nLet me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility. \nBeing lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. \n\nThis president has taken a $5. 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. \nBut guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing. \nAnd the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year. \nThey've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. \nThey've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. \nI'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect. \n New question to you, Senator Kerry, two minutes. And it's still on jobs. You know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the president's fault. \nSo I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs? \n I don't blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it. \nOutsourcing is going to happen. I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I've had shop stewards stand up and say, \"Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing? \"And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, \"No, I can't do that. \"\nWhat I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job. \nToday, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes. \nSo if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, \"Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. \"\nThat's not smart. I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. \nThe second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months. \nThe fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it. \nThe fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for. I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That's what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact. \nPlus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better. \n Mr. President? \n Whew!\nLet me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements. He said we cut Pell Grants. We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. That's a fact. \nYou know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers. \nYou've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed. \nIf you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That's money in your pocket. \nIf you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage. \nWe created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief. \nIt's your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, \"We're going to spend the government's money. \"No, we're spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want. \nI believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives. \nMy opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric. \nHe voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times. \n Senator Kerry? \n Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that. \nI have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts. \nBut you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money. \nBut they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money. \nWe have more people who qualify. That's not what we want. \n Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times. \nHe voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts. \n Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here. \nBoth of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question. Do you believe homosexuality is a choice? \n You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It's important that we do that. \nAnd I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live. \nAnd that's to be honored. \nBut as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman. \nI proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. \nIt has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution. \nI'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. \nMy opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman. \nBut I'm concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests. \n Senator Kerry? \n We're all God's children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as. \nI think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it. \nAnd I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them. \nI think we have to respect that. \nThe president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. \nBut I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people. \nYou can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth. \nNow, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately. \n Senator Kerry, a new question for you. \nThe New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research. \nWhat is your reaction to that? \n I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many. \nI believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith. \nI believe that choice is a woman's choice. It's between a woman, God and her doctor. And that's why I support that. \nNow, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade. \nThe president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to. \nI will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade. \nNow, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me. \nAnd as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, \"I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. \"\nMy faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, \"What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. \"\nAnd I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people. \nThat's why I fight against poverty. That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth. \nThat's why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith. \nBut I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service. \n Mr. President? \n I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. \nTake, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law. \nWhat I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs. \nThe last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That's great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion. \n Mr. President, let's have a new question. It goes to you. And let's get back to economic issues. \nHealth insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last four years according to The Washington Post. We're paying more. We're getting less. \nI would like to ask you: Who bears responsibility for this? Is it the government? Is it the insurance companies? Is it the lawyers? Is it the doctors? Is it the administration? \n Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration. \nThere's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there's no market forces involved with health care. \nIt's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. \nSecondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform. \nIn the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. \nThirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology. It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. \nAnd so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care. We're beginning to do it. We're changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. \nPeople tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. \nAnd finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. \nAnd so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care. \n Senator Kerry? \n The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs. Let me give you a prime example. \nIn the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right. The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada. \nWe also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. The VA does that. The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans. We could have done that in Medicare. \nMedicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. \nBut rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. \nResult: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums. \nWhen I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit. \nNow, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance. So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more. \nWe got to have health care for all Americans. \n Go ahead, Mr. President. \n I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years? He has no record on reforming of health care. No record at all. \nHe introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five. \nNo record of leadership. \nI came to Washington to solve problems. I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food. And so I led. And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare. \n Senator Kerry? Thirty seconds. \n Once again, the president is misleading America. I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills. \nBut more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s. And I'm very proud of that. \nSo the president's wrong. \n Let me direct the next question to you, Senator Kerry, and again, let's stay on health care. \nYou have, as you have proposed and as the president has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children. You're also talking about the government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. \nAnd you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper 2 percent. \nYou heard the president say earlier tonight that it's going to cost a whole lot more money than that. \nI'd just ask you, where are you going to get the money? \n Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect. One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. \nThe fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I don't force you to do anything. It's not a government plan. The government doesn't require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. \nIf you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. \nBut I got a better plan. And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. \nHere's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. It's their choice. \nI think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them. \nWe allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C. \nYou want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. \nIn addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. \nNow, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And I'm going to offer it to America. \n Mr. President? \n In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind. Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the senator's plan. It cost $1.2 trillion.\nThe Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care. It would be the largest increase in government health care ever. \nIf you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them? \nIt's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance. \nWe have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice. \nOnce a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls. \nAnd just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor-quality health care. \nOur health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital. \n Senator? \n The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality. \nNow, maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining. Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare. He doesn't adequately fund it. \nBut let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program. That's not what I have. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Senators and congressmen have a wide choice. Americans ought to have it too. \n Mr. President? \n Talk about the VA: We've increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since I've been president. That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding. \nOf course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that. \nWe're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country. We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now. Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years. \n Mr. President, the next question is to you. We all know that Social Security is running out of money, and it has to be fixed. You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up. \nSo where do you get the money? Are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years? \n First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks. \nI remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away. Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks. \nThere is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem. And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. And so I think we need to think differently. We'll honor our commitment to our seniors. But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. \nAnd recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at. \nI believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust. \nAnd the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats. It'll be a vital issue in my second term. It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together. \nAnd we're of course going to have to consider the costs. But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children. \n Senator Kerry? \n You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts. \nNow, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster. \nThe CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees. And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent. \nNow, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from? \nHe's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for. Not one of them are paid for. \nThe fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history. He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules. \nI have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility. In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party. We balanced the budget in the '90s. We paid down the debt for two years. \nAnd that's what we're going to do. We're going to protect Social Security. I will not privatize it. I will not cut the benefits. And we're going to be fiscally responsible. And we will take care of Social Security. \n Let me just stay on Social Security with a new question for Senator Kerry, because, Senator Kerry, you have just said you will not cut benefits. \nAlan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says there's no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate. \nWhat he's suggesting, we're going to cut benefits or we're going to have to raise the retirement age. We may have to take some other reform. But if you've just said, you've promised no changes, does that mean you're just going to leave this as a problem, another problem for our children to solve? \n Not at all. Absolutely not, Bob. This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on \"Meet the Press\" with Tim Russert in 1990-something. We heard the same thing. We fixed it. \nIn fact, we put together a $5. 6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075. \nThe president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut. I don't. I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year. \nAnd when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country. \nNow, we can do that. \nNow, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country. We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s. And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary. \nBut the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America. The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing. And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1. 6 million jobs. \nEleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has. \nI have a plan to put America back to work. And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security. \n Mr. President? \n He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security. I heard more of the same. \nHe talks about middle-class tax cuts. That's exactly where the tax cuts went. Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans. And now the tax code is more fair. Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed. If you have a child, you got tax relief. If you're married, you got tax relief. If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief. All of which was opposed by my opponent. \nAnd the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession. \nPeople need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down. And it was one of the largest declines in our history. And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs. \nBut we acted. I led the Congress. We passed tax relief. And now this economy is growing. We added 1. 9 million new jobs over the last 13 months. \nSure, there's more work to do. But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners. It's not to increase the scope of the federal government. It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low. \n Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. \nI got more e-mail this week on this question than any other question. And it is about immigration. \nI'm told that at least 8,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know. Some believe it's an economic issue. Some see it as a human-rights issue. \nHow do you see it? And what do we need to do about it? \n I see it as a serious problem. I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue. \nWe're increasing the border security of the United States. We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border. \nWe're using new equipment. We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across. \nAnd we'll continue to do so over the next four years. It's a subject I'm very familiar with. After all, I was a border governor for a while. \nMany people are coming to this country for economic reasons. They're coming here to work. If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. 15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And that's what's happening. \nAnd so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs. \nThat has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it. \nIt also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job. \nNow, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty. I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line. \nIf they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too. \nAnd here is where my opponent and I differ. In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens. \n Time's up. \nSenator? \n Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration. \nThe American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob. And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs. \nThe fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929. And the take-home pay of the richest . 1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928. \nUnder President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down. Now that's wrong. \nNow, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform. He said he would reform it. Four years later he is now promising another plan. \nHere's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11. The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will. \nSecondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem. \nThe second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly. \nAnd thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American. We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows. SCHIEFFER: Do you want to respond, Mr. President? \n Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders. They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas. \nWe have much more manpower and much more equipment there. \nHe just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. That is an outrageous claim. \nAnd we'll continue to protect our borders. We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment. \n Senator? \n Four thousand people a day are coming across the border. \nThe fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border. \nAnd we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology. We have iris-identification technology. We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today. We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border. \nWe could speed it up. There are huge delays. \nThe fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure. \n Next question to you, Senator Kerry. \nThe gap between rich and poor is growing wider. More people are dropping into poverty. Yet the minimum wage has been stuck at, what, $5. 15 an hour now for about seven years. Is it time to raise it? \n Well, I'm glad you raised that question. \nIt's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage. \nAnd, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself. \nWe have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it. We're not allowed to vote on it. They don't want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years. \nIf we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year. \nThe president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. \nOne percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families. \nWhat we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold on to equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. That's not right in America. \nAnd we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay. They've cut it off. They've stopped it. They don't enforce these kinds of things. \nNow, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream. \nAnd if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage. \n Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage. \nBut let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to. And that's to make sure the education system works. It's to make sure we raise standards. \nListen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it. The No Child Left Behind Act says, \"We'll raise standards. We'll increase federal spending. But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. \"\nYou cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And we weren't diagnosing problems. And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school. \nAnd guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through. \nMany inner-city kids just move through. We've stopped that practice now by measuring early. And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. \nI remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, \"Reading is the new civil right,\" and she's right. In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. \nYou see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom. \n Mr. President, I want to go back to something Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a follow-up of my own. He said -- and this will be a new question to you -- he said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. So I'd ask you directly, would you like to? \n What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges? And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test. \n Senator Kerry, you'd like to respond? \n Is that a new question or a 30-second question? \n That's a new question for Senator -- for President Bush. \n Which time limit. . . \n You have 90 seconds. \n Thank you very much. \nWell, again, the president didn't answer the question. \nI'll answer it straight to America. I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution. And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right. \nSo I don't intend to see it undone. \nClearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it. \nBut let me go a step further. We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America. I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school. \nAnd yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people. \nNow right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind. \nHe'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has. But he didn't put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children. \n Yes, sir? \n Two things. One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with. \nAnd secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough. \nWe've increased funds. But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late. \nHe talked about the unemployed. Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated. \nHe talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language? Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated. \nAnd that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does. \n Senator? \n You don't measure it by a percentage increase. Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done. \nFive hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget. \nNow, that's not in my gut. That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut. \n$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs. You be the judge. \n All right, let's go to another question. And it is to Senator Kerry. \nYou have two minutes, sir. \nSenator, the last debate, President Bush said he did not favor a draft. You agreed with him. But our National Guard and Reserve forces are being severely strained because many of them are being held beyond their enlistments. Some of them say that it's a back-door draft. \nIs there any relief that could be offered to these brave Americans and their families? \nIf you became president, Senator Kerry, what would you do about this situation of holding National Guard and Reservists for these extended periods of time and these repeated call-ups that they're now facing? \n Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. \nOur military is overextended. Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it. \nNow, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support. \nIn addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. We ought to be doing that. And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. \nBut the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side. \nI've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith to the American people in the way that he took this nation to war. He said he would work through a real alliance. He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. Well, we didn't. And the result is our forces today are overextended. \nThe fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result. And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably. And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden. \n Mr. President? \n The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing. We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year. \nI remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia. Some of them had been there before. \nThe people I talked to their spirits were high. They didn't view their service as a back-door draft. They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country. \nMy opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy. \nIn our first debate he proposed America pass a global test. In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval. That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country. \nI'll work with allies. I'll work with friends. We'll continue to build strong coalitions. But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries. \nWe'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists. \n Senator? \n I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation. In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation. No nation will ever have a veto over us. \nBut I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard. That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world. \nBut I'll never fail to protect the United States of America. \n In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force. \nApparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world. \n Mr. President, new question, two minutes. \nYou said that if Congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons, that you'd sign the legislation, but you did nothing to encourage the Congress to extend it. Why not? \n Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear. I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them. \nBut the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number. \nNeighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns. \nTo me, that's the best way to secure America. \n Senator? \n I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban. \nI am a hunter. I'm a gun owner. I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old. And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment. \nBut I'll tell you this. I'm also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest. I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. I've broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. \nAnd most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. \nI was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, \"See the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. \"\nBecause of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. \nAnd that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan. It encouraged them to do it. \nSo I believe America's less safe. \nIf Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, \"Sorry, we don't have the votes,\" I'd have said, \"Then we're going to have a fight. \"\nAnd I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen. We'd have won what Bill Clinton won. \n Let's go to a new question. For you, Senator Kerry, two minutes.\nAffirmative action: Do you see a need for affirmative action programs, or have we moved far enough along that we no longer need to use race and gender as a factor in school admissions and federal and state contracts and so on? \n No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along. \nAnd I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along. I'll give you an example. \nI served on the Small Business Committee for a long time. I was chairman of it once. Now I'm the senior Democrat on it. We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country. They don't reach those goals. They don't even fight to reach those goals. They've tried to undo them. \nThe fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. \nI think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time. \nDuring the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called \"Mend it, don't end it. \"We fixed it. \nAnd we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel. As president, I will make certain we travel it. \nNow, let me just share something. This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country. \nIf a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it. \n Mr. President? \n Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus. I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House. \nAnd secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas. I agree, we shouldn't have quotas. \nBut we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done. We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students. \nDo you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college? \nThat's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. \nI believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. \nMinority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong. \nI believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something. Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before. And that's hopeful, and that's positive. \n Mr. President, let's go to a new question. \nYou were asked before the invasion, or after the invasion, of Iraq if you'd checked with your dad. And I believe, I don't remember the quote exactly, but I believe you said you had checked with a higher authority. \nI would like to ask you, what part does your faith play on your policy decisions? \nFirst, my faith plays a lot -- a big part in my life. And that's, when I was answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot. And I do. \nAnd my faith is a very -- it's very personal. I pray for strength. I pray for wisdom. I pray for our troops in harm's way. I pray for my family. I pray for my little girls. \nBut I'm mindful in a free society that people can worship if they want to or not. You're equally an American if you choose to worship an almighty and if you choose not to. \nIf you're a Christian, Jew or Muslim, you're equally an American. That's the great thing about America, is the right to worship the way you see fit. \nPrayer and religion sustain me. I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency. \nI love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country. Somebody asked me one time, \"Well, how do you know? \"I said, \"I just feel it. \"\nReligion is an important part. I never want to impose my religion on anybody else. \nBut when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am. \nI believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself, as manifested in public policy through the faith-based initiative where we've unleashed the armies of compassion to help heal people who hurt. \nI believe that God wants everybody to be free. That's what I believe. \nAnd that's been part of my foreign policy. In Afghanistan, I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty. And I can't tell you how encouraged I am to see freedom on the march. \nAnd so my principles that I make decisions on are a part of me, and religion is a part of me. \n Senator Kerry? \n Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith. I think it's important and I share it. I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty. \nEverything is a gift from the Almighty. And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being. And people all find their ways to express it. \nI was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. \nWe have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have. And we're struggling with that today. \nAnd the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith. \nI talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead. \nI think we've got a lot more work to do. And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America. \n Senator Kerry, after 9/11 -- and this is a new question for you -- it seemed to me that the country came together as I've never seen it come together since World War II. But some of that seems to have melted away. I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season. \nBut if you were elected president, or whoever is elected president, will you set a priority in trying to bring the nation back together? Or what would be your attitude on that? \n Very much so. \nLet me pay a compliment to the president, if I may. I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job. And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress. \nAnd I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans. That's where we were. \nThat's not where we are today. I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today. \nWe have to change that. And as president, I am committed to changing that. I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side. I think we have to come together and work to change it. \nAnd I've done that. Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues. I've reached across the aisle. I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans. \nAnd if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together. \nAnd one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America. \n Mr. President? \n My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is. I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful I'd be able to do the same thing. \nAnd we made good progress early on. The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy. \nAnd we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow. \nBut Washington is a tough town. And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in. \nI'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so. \nMy opponent said this is a bitterly divided time. Pretty divided in the 2000 election. So in other words, it's pretty divided during the 1990s as well. \nWe're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did. John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq. And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq. \n We've come, gentlemen, to our last question. And it occurred to me as I came to this debate tonight that the three of us share something. All three of us are surrounded by very strong women. We're all married to strong women. Each of us have two daughters that make us very proud. \nI'd like to ask each of you, what is the most important thing you've learned from these strong women? \n To listen to them. \n\nTo stand up straight and not scowl. \n\nI love the strong women around me. I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters. \nI am -- you know it's really interesting. I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, \"Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech. \"I said, \"OK, you've got a deal. \"Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal. And she's out campaigning along with our girls. And she speaks English a lot better than I do. I think people understand what she's saying. \nBut they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush. I can't tell you how lucky I am. When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue. O'Neill said, \"Come on over. I think you'll find somebody who might interest you. \"So I said all right. Bopped over there. There was only four of us there. And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight. \n Senator Kerry? \n Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up. \n\nAnd some would say maybe me more so than others.\n\nBut I can take it. \n\nCan I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didn't ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run. And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing. \nAnd she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, \"Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity. \"Those are the three words that she left me with. \nAnd my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong. \nThey also kick me around. They keep me honest. They don't let me get away with anything. I can sometimes take myself too seriously. They surely don't let me do that. \nAnd I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time. I've watched him with the first lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughters. He's a great father. And I think we're both very lucky. \n Well, gentlemen, that brings us to the closing statements. \nSenator Kerry, I believe you're first. \n My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division. More than ever, we need to be united as a country. \nAnd, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger. \nThese are dangerous times. I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world. And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans. \nWe can lift our schools up. We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas. We can have health care for all Americans. We can further the cause of equality in our nation. \nLet me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security. Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love. \nAnd, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher. I believe we can do better. \nI think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. And I ask you to embark on that journey with me. \nI ask you for your trust. I ask you for your help. I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever. \nThank you. Goodnight. And God bless the United States of America. \n Mr. President? \n In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee. And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene. \nAnd he said this about it. \nHe said, \"Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain. It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side. It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. \"\nI love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America. And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years. We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. \nAnd yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing. Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow. \nWe reformed our school system, and now there's an achievement gap in America that's beginning to close. Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America. \nOver the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable. \nOver the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods. \nI'm optimistic that we'll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose. We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate. \nAnd as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty. We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world. \nMy hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world. \nI want to thank you for listening tonight. \nI'm asking for your vote. \nGod bless you. \n Thank you, Mr. President. \nThank you, Senator Kerry. \nWell, that brings these debates to a close, but the campaign goes on. \nI want to wish both of you the very best of luck between now and Election Day. \nThat's it for us from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. I'm Bob Schieffer at CBS News. \nGoodnight, everyone. \n \n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "spoken", "name": "3rd_Bush-Kerry", "class": "debate-transcript"}

This is -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Um,\n    \n    \n      Ha! \n    \n    \n      Very nice.\n    \n    \n      Um, so we thought that,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      We can write up\n    \n    \n      uh,\n    \n    \n      an element,\n    \n    \n      and - for each of the situation\n    \n    \n      nodes that we observed in the Bayes-net?\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      What's the  situation   like at the entity that is mentioned? if we know anything about it? Is it under construction?\n    \n    \n      Or is it\n    \n    \n      on fire or something  happening to it? Or is it stable?\n    \n    \n      and so forth, going all the way\n    \n    \n      um,\n    \n    \n      f-\n    \n    \n      through Parking,\n    \n    \n      Location, Hotel, Car, Restroom,\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Riots, Fairs, Strikes, or\n    \n    \n      Disasters.\n    \n    \n      So is - This is - A situation are - is all the things which can be happening right  now? \n    \n    \n      Or,  what  is the situation\n    \n    \n      type?\n    \n    \n      That's basically  just specifying the - the input for the - w- what's\n    \n    \n      Oh,  I  see y- Why are you specifying it in X_M_L?\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      Just because it forces us to be specific about the values \n    \n    \n      here?\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      And, also, I mean, this is a - what the input is going to be. Right?\n    \n    \n      So, we will, uh - \n    \n    \n      This is a  schema.  This is -\n    \n    \n      Well, yeah. I just don't know if this is th- l- what the - Does - This is what Java Bayes takes? as a\n    \n    \n      No, because I mean if we -\n    \n    \n      Bayes-net spec?\n    \n    \n      I mean we're  sure  gonna interface to -\n    \n    \n      We're gonna get an X_M_L document from  somewhere. \n    \n    \n      Right? And that X_M_L document will say\n    \n    \n      \"We  are  able to - We  were  able to observe that w- the element,\n    \n    \n      um,   of the Location that the  car  is  near. \"\n    \n    \n      So that's gonna be -  \n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      So this is the situational context, everything in it. Is that what Situation is short for, shi- situational context?\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      So this is just,\n    \n    \n      again, a- an X_M_L schemata which defines a set of possible, uh, permissible X_M_L\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      structures,\n    \n    \n      which we view as input into the Bayes-net.\n    \n    \n      Right?\n    \n    \n      And then we can r-  uh\n    \n    \n      possibly run one of them uh\n    \n    \n      transformations?\n    \n    \n      That put it into the format that the Bayes n- or Java Bayes or whatever wants?\n    \n    \n      Yea- Are you talking - are you talking about the - the  structure? \n    \n    \n      Well it -\n    \n    \n      I mean when you  observe  a node.\n    \n    \n      When you - when you say \n    \n    \n      the input to the  v- Java Bayes, \n    \n    \n      Um-hmm.\n    \n    \n      it takes a certain format, right?\n    \n    \n      Which I don't think is  this. \n    \n    \n      Although I don't know.\n    \n    \n      No, it's  certainly  not this.\n    \n    \n      Nuh. \n    \n    \n      So you could just - Couldn't you just run a -\n    \n    \n       X_S_L .  Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      To convert it into the Java Bayes for- format?\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      That's -\n    \n    \n      That's no problem, but\n    \n    \n      I even think that, um -\n    \n    \n      I mean,  once   - Once you have this sort of as - running as a module -\n    \n    \n      Right? What you  want  is -\n    \n    \n      You wanna say, \"O_K, give me the posterior probabilities of the Go-there  node,\n    \n    \n      when  this  is happening.\"\n    \n    \n      Right? When the person said  this,  the car is  there,  it's  raining,  and this is happening.\n    \n    \n      And with  this  you can specify the - what's happening in the situation, and what's happening\n    \n    \n      with the  user. \n    \n    \n      So we get -\n    \n    \n      After we are done, through the Situation we get the User Vector.\n    \n    \n      So, this is a -\n    \n    \n      So this is just a specification of all the possible inputs?\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n       And, \n    \n    \n      all the possible  outputs,   too. \n    \n    \n       O_K.  \n    \n    \n      So, we have, um,\n    \n    \n      for example, the, uh, Go-there decision node\n    \n    \n      which has two\n    \n    \n      elements, going-there\n    \n    \n      and its posterior probability,\n    \n    \n      and  not-going-there  and its  posterior   probability,\n    \n    \n      because the output is always gonna be\n    \n    \n      all the decision nodes and all the - the - a- all the posterior probabilities for all the values.\n    \n    \n      And then we would just look at the, eh, Struct that we wanna look at in terms of if - if we're only asking about one of the -\n    \n    \n      So like, if I'm just interested in the going-there node,\n    \n    \n      I would just pull that information out of the Struct\n    \n    \n      that gets return- that would - that Java Bayes would output?\n    \n    \n      Um,\n    \n    \n      pretty much, yes, but\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I think it's a little bit more complex.\n    \n    \n      As, if I understand it correctly, it  always  gives you  all  the posterior probabilities for  all  the values of  all  decision nodes.\n    \n    \n      So, when we\n    \n    \n       input   something, \n    \n    \n      we always get the, uh, posterior probabilities for all of these. Right?\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      So there is no way of telling it t-\n    \n    \n       not  to tell us about the  EVA   values.\n    \n    \n      Yeah,  wait  I agree, that's - yeah,  use - oh, uh   Yeah, O_K.\n    \n    \n      So - so we get this whole\n    \n    \n       list  of - of, um,\n    \n    \n      things, and the question is\n    \n    \n      what to  do  with it,\n    \n    \n      what to hand on,\n    \n    \n      how to  interpret  it,\n    \n    \n      in a sense.\n    \n    \n      So y- you said if you - \"I'm only interested in whether he wants to  go  there or not\", then I just  look  at that  node, \n    \n    \n      look which one -\n    \n    \n      Look at that Struct in the output, right?\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      Look at that Struct in the - the output, even though\n    \n    \n      I wouldn't call it a \"Struct\". But.\n    \n    \n      Well i- well, it's an X_M_L Structure that's being res- returned, right?\n    \n    \n      Oh. Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      So every part of a structure is a \"Struct\".\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I just uh - I just was - abbreviated it\n    \n    \n      to Struct in my head, and\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      started going with that.\n    \n    \n       That  element or object,\n    \n    \n      I would say.\n    \n    \n      Not a C_Struct. That's not what I was trying to k-  though  yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      And, um,\n    \n    \n      the reason is -\n    \n    \n      why I think it's a little bit more complex or why - why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is -\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      The, uh -\n    \n    \n      Let's look at an  example. \n    \n    \n      Well, w- wouldn't we just take the structure that's outputted\n    \n    \n      and then run another transformation on it, that would just dump the one that we wanted out?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yeah. w- We'd need to  prune. \n    \n    \n      Right?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Throw things away.\n    \n    \n      Well, actually, you don't even need to  do  that with X_M_L. D- Can't you just look at one specific -\n    \n    \n       No-\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yeah,  exactly.  The -  \n    \n    \n       Xerxes \n    \n    \n      allows you to say, u- \"Just give me the value of that, and that, and that.\"\n    \n    \n      But, we don't really  know  what we're interested in  before we look at the  complete  - at - at the  overall  result.\n    \n    \n      So the person said,\n    \n    \n      um,\n    \n    \n      \"Where is X_?\" and so,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       we  want to know,\n    \n    \n      um,\n    \n    \n      is - Does he want\n    \n    \n      info?\n    \n    \n      o- on this? or know the  location? \n    \n    \n      Or does he want to  go  there?\n    \n    \n      Let's assume this is our - our question.\n    \n    \n      Sure.\n    \n    \n      Nuh? \n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Do this in Perl. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      So we get -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       O_K .\n    \n    \n      Let's assume this is the output.\n    \n    \n       So. \n    \n    \n      We should con- be able to conclude from that that -\n    \n    \n      I mean. It's  always  gonna give us a value of\n    \n    \n      how likely we think i- it is that he  wants  to go there and  doesn't  want to go there,\n    \n    \n      or how likely it is that he  wants  to\n    \n    \n      get  information. \n    \n    \n      But, maybe w- we should just  reverse  this to make it a  little  bit more  delicate. \n    \n    \n      So, does he wanna know where it  is?  or does he wanna  go  there?\n    \n    \n      He wants to know where it is.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      I - I - I tend to agree. And if it's -\n    \n    \n      If -\n    \n    \n      Well now, y- I mean, you could -\n    \n    \n      And i- if there's sort of a clear winner  here, \n    \n    \n      and, um -\n    \n    \n      and this is pretty, uh -\n    \n    \n      indifferent,\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      then we - then we might conclude that he actually wants to\n    \n    \n      just know where, uh t- uh, he  does  want to go there.\n    \n    \n      Uh, out of curiosity, is there a reason why we wouldn't\n    \n    \n      combine\n    \n    \n      these three nodes?\n    \n    \n      into one smaller subnet? \n    \n    \n      that would just\n    \n    \n      basically be \n    \n    \n      the question for - We have \"where is X_?\" is the question, right? That would just be Info-on or Location?\n    \n    \n      Based upon -\n    \n    \n      Or Go-there. A lot of people ask that, if they actually just wanna  go  there.\n    \n    \n      People come up to you on campus and say, \"Where's the library?\"\n    \n    \n      You're gonna say - y- you're gonna say, g- \"Go down  that  way.\"\n    \n    \n      You're not gonna say \"It's - It's five hundred yards away from you\" or \"It's north of you\", or -\n    \n    \n      \"it's located -\"\n    \n    \n      Well, I mean - But the - there's - So you just have three\n    \n    \n      decisions for the final node, that would link thes- these three nodes in the net together.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      I don't know whether I  understand  what you mean. But.  Again,  in  this  -\n    \n    \n      Given this input, we, also in some situations, may wanna\n    \n    \n      postulate an opinion whether\n    \n    \n      that person wants to go there  now \n    \n    \n      the  nicest  way, use a  cab,  or so s-\n    \n    \n      wants to know it - wants to know where it is because he wants something  fixed  there, because he wants to\n    \n    \n      visit t- it or whatever.\n    \n    \n      So, it - n- I mean - a-  All  I'm saying is,\n    \n    \n      whatever our input  is,  we're always gonna get the full\n    \n    \n      output.\n    \n    \n      And some -\n    \n    \n       some  things\n    \n    \n      will always be sort of\n    \n    \n      too - not significant enough.\n    \n    \n      Wha-\n    \n    \n      Or i- or i- it'll be tight. You won't - it'll be hard to decide. But I mean, I guess - I guess the thing is,\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      uh,\n    \n    \n      this is another, smaller, case of reasoning in the case of an  uncertainty,  which makes me think Bayes-net should be\n    \n    \n      the way to  solve \n    \n    \n      these things. So if you had - If for every construction, right?\n    \n    \n      Oh!\n    \n    \n      you could say, \"Well, there - Here's the Where-Is construction.\"\n    \n    \n      And for the Where-Is construction, we know we need to l- look at this node,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      that merges these three things together\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      as for th- to decide the response. And since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with, we could have a finite number of nodes.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Say, if we had to y- deal with arbitrary language, it wouldn't make any sense to do that, because\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      there'd be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      But since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff - \n    \n    \n      So, basically, the idea is to f-\n    \n    \n      to feed the output of that\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      belief-net into another belief-net.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, so basically take these three things and then put  them   into another belief-net.\n    \n    \n      But, why - why - why only those  three?  Why not the whol-\n    \n    \n      Well, I mean, d- For the Where-Is question.\n    \n    \n      So we'd have a node for the Where-Is question.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. But we believe that all the decision nodes are - can be relevant for the Where-Is,\n    \n    \n      and the Where - How-do-I-get-to or the Tell-me-something-about.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Is food not allowed in here? \n    \n    \n      You can come in if you want.\n    \n    \n      Yes, it  is  allowed.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      As long as y- you're not wearing your h- your h-  headphones. \n    \n    \n      Alright. Just a second. I'll be back.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Well, I do- I - See, I don't know if this is a  good idea or not. I'm just throwing it out.\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      But uh, it seems like we could have - I mea- or uh we could put all of the- all of the r- information that could also be relevant \n    \n    \n      into the Where-Is node answer\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      node\n    \n    \n      thing\n    \n    \n      stuff.\n    \n    \n      And uh -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       O_K.\n    \n    \n      I mean -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Let's not forget we're gonna get some very strong  input from  these sub- dis- from these  discourse  things, right?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      \"Tell me the location of X_.\"\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       Nuh?  \n    \n    \n      Or \"Where is X_ located\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      We u-\n    \n    \n      at?\" Nuh? \n    \n    \n      Yeah, I know, but the Bayes-net would be able to - The weights on the -\n    \n    \n      on the nodes in the Bayes-net would be able to do all that, wouldn't it?\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Here's a k-\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Oh! \n    \n    \n      Oh, I'll wait until you're  plugged in.\n    \n    \n      Oh,  don't  sit there. Sit  here. \n    \n    \n      You know how you don't like  that  one. It's O_K.\n    \n    \n       Oh, do I not? \n    \n    \n       That's  the  weird  one.\n    \n    \n      That's the one that's painful. That hurts. It hurts  so  bad.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I'm h- I'm happy that they're recording that.\n    \n    \n      That headphone. The headphone  that you have to put on backwards, with the little - little thing - and the little - little foam block on it?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      It's a painful, painful microphone.\n    \n    \n      I think it's th- called \"the Crown\". \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       The crown? \n    \n    \n      What?\n    \n    \n      Yeah, versus \"the Sony\".\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The Crown?\n    \n    \n      Is that the actual name?\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      The manufacturer.\n    \n    \n      I don't see a manufacturer on it.\n    \n    \n      You w-\n    \n    \n      Oh, wait, here it is. h-  This  thingy.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, it's \"The Crown\".\n    \n    \n      The crown of pain!\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yes.\n    \n    \n      You're on-line?\n    \n    \n      Are you - are your mike o- Is your mike on? O_K.\n    \n    \n      Indeed.\n    \n    \n      So you've been working with these guys? You know what's going on?\n    \n    \n      Yes, I have.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And, I do.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, alright. s- So where are we?\n    \n    \n      Excellent! \n    \n    \n      We're  discussing  this.\n    \n    \n      I don't think it can handle French, but anyway.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      Assume we have  something  coming in. A person says, \"Where is X_?\", and we get a certain - We have a Situation vector and a User vector and  everything  is  fine? \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      An- an- and - and our - and our -\n    \n    \n      Did you just sti- Did you just stick the m- the - the - the  microphone  actually in the  tea? \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      No. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And, um,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I'm not drinking tea. What are you talking about?\n    \n    \n      Oh, yeah. Sorry.\n    \n    \n      let's just assume our Bayes-net just has  three  decision nodes for the time being.\n    \n    \n      These three, he wants to know something  about  it, he wants to know  where  it  is,  he wants to go there.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      In terms of, these would be wha- how we would answer the question Where-Is, right?\n    \n    \n      We u-\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      This is - i- That's what you s- it  seemed  like, explained it to me earlier w-\n    \n    \n      We - we're - we wanna know how to answer the question \"Where is X_?\"\n    \n    \n      Yeah, but, mmm.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yeah.  \n    \n    \n      No, I can - I can do the Timing node in here,  too,  and say \"O_K.\"\n    \n    \n      Well, yeah, but in the s- uh, let's just deal with the s- the  simple  case of we're not worrying about timing or anything.\n    \n    \n      We just want to know how we should answer \"Where is X_?\"\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      And, um,\n    \n    \n      O_K, and,\n    \n    \n      Go-there has two values, right?, Go-there and  not-Go-there.  Let's assume those are the posterior probabilities of  that. \n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Info-on has True or False and Location. So, he wants to know something about it, and he wants to know something - he wants to know Where-it-is,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Excuse me. \n    \n    \n      has  these  values.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And, um,\n    \n    \n      Oh,  I  see why we can't do that.\n    \n    \n      And, um, in  this  case we would probably all agree that\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      he  wants  to  go  there. Our belief-net thinks he wants to go there, right? In the, uh, whatever, if we have something like\n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      this here,\n    \n    \n      and\n    \n    \n      this like  that  and maybe here also some -\n    \n    \n      You should probably \n    \n    \n      make them out of -  Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Well, it-\n    \n    \n      something like  that, \n    \n    \n      then we would guess, \"Aha! He,  our  belief-net, \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      has s- stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is, than actually wants to go  there.\"\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Right?\n    \n    \n      That it - Doesn't this assume, though, that they're evenly weighted?\n    \n    \n      True.\n    \n    \n      Like -\n    \n    \n      I guess they  are  evenly weighted.\n    \n    \n      The different decision nodes, you mean?\n    \n    \n      Yeah, the Go-there, the Info-on, and the Location?\n    \n    \n      Well, d-  yeah,  this is making the assumption.\n    \n    \n      Yes.\n    \n    \n      Like -\n    \n    \n      What do you  mean  by \"differently weighted\"? They don't feed into anything  really   anymore. \n    \n    \n      Or I jus-\n    \n    \n      But I mean, why do we -\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Le-\n    \n    \n      If we trusted the Go-there node more th- much more than we trusted the  other  ones, then we would conclude, even in this situation, that he wanted to go there.\n    \n    \n      So, in that sense, we weight them equally\n    \n    \n      O_K. Makes sense. Yeah.\n    \n    \n      right now.\n    \n    \n      So the- But I guess the- k- the question -\n    \n    \n      But -\n    \n    \n      that I was as- er- wondering or maybe Robert was proposing to me\n    \n    \n      is -\n    \n    \n      How do we d- make the decision on - as to - which one to listen to?\n    \n    \n      Yeah, so, the final d- decision is the combination of these three. So again, it's - it's some kind of, uh -\n    \n    \n      Bayes-net. \n    \n    \n      Yeah, sure.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      O_K so, then, the question i- So then my question is t- to you then, would be -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      So is the only r- reason we can  make  all these smaller Bayes-nets, because we know we can only deal with a finite set of constructions?\n    \n    \n      Cuz oth- If we're just taking arbitrary language in, we couldn't have a node for every possible question, you know?\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      A decision node for every possible question, you mean?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Well, I - like, in the case of - Yeah.\n    \n    \n      In the ca- Any piece of language, we wouldn't be able to answer it with this system, b- if we just h-\n    \n    \n      Cuz we wouldn't have the correct node. Basically, w- what you're s- proposing is a n- Where-Is node, right?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      And - and if we - And if someone - says, you know, uh, something in Mandarin\n    \n    \n      So is -\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      to the system, we'd- wouldn't know which node to look at to answer that question, right?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Mmm?\n    \n    \n      So, but - but if we have a finite - What?\n    \n    \n      I don't see your point. What - what - what  I  am thinking, or what\n    \n    \n      we're about to propose here is\n    \n    \n      we're always gonna get the whole list of\n    \n    \n      values and their posterior probabilities.\n    \n    \n      And now we need an expert system or belief-net or something that  interprets  that,\n    \n    \n      that looks at all the\n    \n    \n      values and says,\n    \n    \n      \"The winner is\n    \n    \n      Timing. Now, go there.\"\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \"Uh, go there, Timing, now.\"\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Or, \"The winner is Info-on,\n    \n    \n      Function-Off.\"\n    \n    \n      So, he wants to know  something about it, and what it does.\n    \n    \n       Nuh?  \n    \n    \n      Uh, regardless of - of - of the input. Wh- Regardle-\n    \n    \n      Yeah, but-\n    \n    \n      But how does the expert - but how does the expert system\n    \n    \n      know - how- who- which one to declare the winner, if it doesn't know the question it is, and how that question should be answered?\n    \n    \n      Based on the k- what the  question   was,  so what the discourse, the ontology, the situation and the user model gave us, we came up with these values for these decisions.\n    \n    \n      Yeah I know. But how do we weight what we get out?\n    \n    \n      As, which one i- Which ones are important?\n    \n    \n      So my i- So, if we were to it with a Bayes-net, we'd have to have a node -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      for every question that we knew how to deal with,\n    \n    \n      that would take  all   of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Does that make sense?\n    \n    \n      Yay, nay?\n    \n    \n      Um, I mean, are you saying that, what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation, or are we just dealing with arbitrary language?\n    \n    \n      We -\n    \n    \n      Is that your point?\n    \n    \n      Well, no. I - I guess my question is,\n    \n    \n      Is the reason that we can make a node f- or - O_K. So, lemme\n    \n    \n      see if I'm confused. Are we going to make a node for every question? Does that make sense? - Or not. \n    \n    \n      For every question? Like -\n    \n    \n      Every construction.\n    \n    \n      Hmm. \n    \n    \n      I don't - Not  necessarily,  I would think. I mean, it's not based on constructions, it's based on things like, uh, there's gonna be a node for Go-there or not, and there's gonna be a node for Enter, View, Approach.\n    \n    \n      Wel-\n    \n    \n      W- O_K.\n    \n    \n      So, someone asked a question.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      How do we decide\n    \n    \n      how to answer it?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Well, look at -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      look -\n    \n    \n      Face yourself with this pr- question. You get this -\n    \n    \n      You'll have - y- This is what you get.\n    \n    \n      And now you have to make a decision. What do we think?\n    \n    \n      What does this tell us?\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      And  not  knowing what was asked, and what happened, and whether the person  was  a tourist or a  local,  because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these\n    \n    \n      posterior probabilities.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      What - what we need is a - just a mechanism that says,\n    \n    \n      \"Aha!\n    \n    \n      There is -\"\n    \n    \n      I just don't think a \"winner-take-all\" type of thing is the -\n    \n    \n      I mean, in general, like, we won't just have those three, right? We'll have, uh, like, many, many nodes.\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      So we have to, like - So that it's no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say.\n    \n    \n      Because there are  interdependencies,  right?\n    \n    \n      The uh -\n    \n    \n      Uh, no. So if - if\n    \n    \n      for example, the  Go-there  posterior possibility is  so  high, um,\n    \n    \n      uh, w- if it's - if it has reached -  reached  a certain height, then\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      all of this becomes irrelevant. So. If - even if - if the function or the history or something is\n    \n    \n      scoring pretty good on the  true  node,  true  value -\n    \n    \n      Wel-\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I don't know about that, cuz that would suggest that - I mean -\n    \n    \n      He wants to go there  and  know something about it?\n    \n    \n      Do they have to be mutual-\n    \n    \n      Yeah. Do they have to be mutually exclusive?\n    \n    \n      I think to  some  extent they  are. \n    \n    \n      Or maybe they're  not. \n    \n    \n      Cuz I, uh - The way you describe what they meant, they weren't mutu- uh, they didn't seem mutually exclusive to me.\n    \n    \n      Well, if he  doesn't  want to  go  there,\n    \n    \n      even if the  Enter \n    \n    \n      posterior proba- So.\n    \n    \n      Wel- \n    \n    \n      Go-there is No.\n    \n    \n       Enter  is High, and  Info-on  is High.\n    \n    \n      Well, yeah, just out of the other three, though, that you had in the -\n    \n    \n      Hmm?\n    \n    \n      those three nodes. The- d- They didn't seem like they were mutually exclusive.\n    \n    \n      No, there's - No. But -\n    \n    \n      It's through the -\n    \n    \n      So th- s- so, yeah, but some - So, some things would drop out, and some things would still be important.\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      But I guess what's confusing me is, if we have a Bayes-net to deal w- another Bayes-net to deal with this stuff,\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      you know,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      uh,\n    \n    \n      is the only reason - O_K, so,\n    \n    \n      I guess,\n    \n    \n      if we have a Ba- another Bayes-net to deal with this stuff, the only r- reason \n    \n    \n      we can design it is cuz we know\n    \n    \n      what each question is asking?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      I think that's true.\n    \n    \n      And then, so, the only reason - way we would know what question he's asking is based upon - Oh, so if - Let's say I had a construction parser, and I plug this in, I would know what each construction - the communicative\n    \n    \n      intent of the construction was\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      and so then I would know how to weight the nodes appropriately, in response.\n    \n    \n      So no matter what they said, if I could map it onto a Where-Is construction,\n    \n    \n      Ge-\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      I could say, \"ah!\n    \n    \n      well the- the intent, here, was Where-Is\",\n    \n    \n      O_K, right.\n    \n    \n      and I could look at those.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yes, I mean. Sure. You  do  need to know - I mean, to have that kind of information.\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I'm also agreeing that  a simple\n    \n    \n      pru- \n    \n    \n      Take the ones where we  have  a clear winner.\n    \n    \n      Forget about the ones where it's all sort of\n    \n    \n      middle ground.\n    \n    \n      Prune those out and just hand over the ones where we have a  winner.  \n    \n    \n      Yeah, because that would be the  easiest   way.\n    \n    \n      We just compose as an output an X_M_L mes-  message that says.\n    \n    \n      \"Go there  now.\"\n    \n    \n      \"Enter\n    \n    \n      historical information.\"\n    \n    \n      And not care whether that's consistent with anything.\n    \n    \n      Right?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      But in  this  case if we say, \" definitely  he  doesn't  want to go there. He just wants to know\n    \n    \n       where  it is.\"\n    \n    \n      or let's call this - this \"Look-At-H-\" \n    \n    \n      He wants to know something about the history of. So he said,\n    \n    \n      \"Tell me something about the history of that.\"\n    \n    \n      Now, the e- But for some reason the Endpoint-Approach\n    \n    \n      gets a really high score,  too.\n    \n    \n      We can't expect this to be sort of at O_ point \n    \n    \n      three, three, three, O_ point, three, three, three, O_ point, three, three, three. Right? \n    \n    \n      Somebody needs to  zap  that.\n    \n    \n      You know?\n    \n    \n      Or\n    \n    \n      know -\n    \n    \n      There needs to be  some  knowledge that -\n    \n    \n      We -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, but, the Bayes-net that would merge -\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      I  just   realized that I had my hand in between my mouth and my micr- er, my- and my microphone. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       So  then,\n    \n    \n      the Bayes-net that would merge\n    \n    \n      there, that would make the decision between Go-there, Info-on, and Location,\n    \n    \n      would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted, and based upon that node, then you would  look  at the other stuff.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      I mean, it- i-\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      Does  that  make sense?\n    \n    \n      Yep. It's sort of one of those, that's - It's more like a decision tree,\n    \n    \n      if - if you want.\n    \n    \n      You first look o- at the  lowball  ones, and then -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, i-\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I didn't intend to say that every possible - O_K.\n    \n    \n      There was  a  confusion there, k- I didn't intend to say every possible thing should go into the Bayes-net, because some of the things aren't relevant in the Bayes-net\n    \n    \n      for a specific question.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Like the  Endpoint \n    \n    \n      is not necessarily relevant in the Bayes-net for  Where-Is  until after you've decided whether you wanna  go  there or not.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Show us the way, Bhaskara.\n    \n    \n      I guess the other thing is that um, yeah. I mean, when you're asked a specific question and you don't even -\n    \n    \n      Like, if you're asked a Where-Is question, you may not even look - like,  ask  for the posterior probability of the, uh, E_V_A node, right?\n    \n    \n      Cuz, that's what - I mean, in the Bayes-net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node. So, I mean,\n    \n    \n      you may not even bother to compute things you don't need.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      Aren't we  always  computing  all? \n    \n    \n      No.\n    \n    \n      You can compute, uh, the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes, given\n    \n    \n      some other nodes, but\n    \n    \n      totally ignore some other nodes, also.\n    \n    \n      Basically, things you ignore get marginalized over.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, but that's - that's just shifting the problem.\n    \n    \n      Then you would have to make a decision, \"O_K, if it's a Where-Is question, which\n    \n    \n      Yeah. So you have to make -\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      decision nodes do I query?\"\n    \n    \n      Yes.\n    \n    \n       That's un-  \n    \n    \n      But I would think that's what you want to do. Right?\n    \n    \n      Mmm. \n    \n    \n      Well, eventually, you still have to pick out which ones you look at. So it's pretty much the same problem, isn't it?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah - it's - it's - it's apples and oranges. Nuh?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I mean, maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance,\n    \n    \n       computational  time. So either you\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      always have it compute  all  the posterior possibilities for  all  the values for  all  nodes, and then prune\n    \n    \n      Mmm.\n    \n    \n      the ones you think that are\n    \n    \n      irrelevant,\n    \n    \n      or you just make a p-\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      a  priori \n    \n    \n      estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      So basically, you'd have a decision tree  query,  Go-there.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      If k- if that's false, query this one. If that's true, query that one. And just basically do a binary search through the - ? \n    \n    \n      I don't know if it would necessarily be that, uh, complicated. But, uh -\n    \n    \n      I mean, it w- \n    \n    \n      Well, in the case of Go-there, it  would  be. In the case - Cuz if you needed an- If y- If Go-there was  true,  you'd wanna know what endpoint\n    \n    \n      was. And if it was  false,  you'd wanna d- look at\n    \n    \n      either Lo-  Income  Info-on or History.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      That's true, I guess. Yeah,  so, in a way you  would  have that.\n    \n    \n      Also, I'm somewhat boggled by that Hugin software.\n    \n    \n      O_K, why's that?\n    \n    \n      I can't figure out how to get the\n    \n    \n      probabilities into it.\n    \n    \n      Like, I'd look at -\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      It's somewha- It's boggling me.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Alright.\n    \n    \n      Well, hopefully it's  fixable.\n    \n    \n      Ju-\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Oh yeah, yeah. I d- I just think I haven't\n    \n    \n       It's - there's a - \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      figured out what - the terms in Hugin mean, versus what Java Bayes terms are.\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Um, by the way, are - Do we know whether Jerry and Nancy  are  coming? Or - ? \n    \n    \n      So we can figure this out.\n    \n    \n      They should come when they're  done  their  stuff,  basically, whenever that is.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      What d- what do they need to do left? \n    \n    \n      Um,\n    \n    \n      I guess,\n    \n    \n      Jerry needs to enter marks,  but I don't know if he's gonna do that now or later.\n    \n    \n      But, uh, if he's gonna enter marks, it's gonna take him awhile, I guess, and he won't be here.\n    \n    \n      And what's Nancy doing?\n    \n    \n      Nancy? Um, she was sorta finishing up the, uh,\n    \n    \n      calculation of marks and assigning of grades, but I don't know if she should be here.\n    \n    \n      Well - or, she should be free after that, so -\n    \n    \n      assuming she's coming to this meeting.\n    \n    \n      I don't know if she knows about it.\n    \n    \n      She's on the  email  list, right?\n    \n    \n      Is she? O_K.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm. \n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Because \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      basically, what -\n    \n    \n      where we  also  have decided, prior to\n    \n    \n      this meeting is that\n    \n    \n      we would have a  rerun  of the  three  of us sitting together \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      sometime  this week  again \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      and finish up the, uh, values\n    \n    \n      of\n    \n    \n      this.\n    \n    \n      So we have,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      uh -\n    \n    \n      Believe it or not, we have  all  the  bottom  ones here. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Well, I -\n    \n    \n      You added a bunch of  nodes, for - ? \n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      We - we - we have - Actually what we have is  this  line.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Uh, what do the, uh,\n    \n    \n      Right?\n    \n    \n      structures\n    \n    \n      Hmm?\n    \n    \n      do? So the - the - the -\n    \n    \n      For instance, this Location node's got two inputs,\n    \n    \n      that one you -\n    \n    \n       Four  inputs.\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      Four. \n    \n    \n      Those are - The bottom things are inputs, also.\n    \n    \n       Oh,  I  see.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      O_K, that was-\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      That makes a lot more sense to me now.\n    \n    \n      Yep. \n    \n    \n      Cuz I thought it was like, that\n    \n    \n      one in\n    \n    \n      Stuart's book about,\n    \n    \n      you know, the -\n    \n    \n      Alarm in the dog?\n    \n    \n      U- Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      Or the earthquake and the alarm.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Sorry. Yeah, I'm confusing  two.  \n    \n    \n      Yeah, there's a dog one, too, but that's in Java Bayes, isn't it?\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Maybe.\n    \n    \n      But there's something about\n    \n    \n      bowel problems or something with the dog.\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      And we have all the\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      top ones,\n    \n    \n      all the ones to which  no  arrows are pointing. \n    \n    \n      What we're missing are the -\n    \n    \n      these, where arrows are pointing, where we're combining\n    \n    \n      top ones.\n    \n    \n      So, we have to come up with values for this, and\n    \n    \n      this, this, this, and so forth. \n    \n    \n      And maybe\n    \n    \n      just fiddle around with it a little bit more. \n    \n    \n      And, um.\n    \n    \n      And then it's just, uh,\n    \n    \n      edges,\n    \n    \n      many of\n    \n    \n      edges. \n    \n    \n      And, um, we  won't   meet next Monday.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      Cuz of Memorial Day?\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      We'll meet next Tuesday, I guess.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      When's Jerry leaving for -\n    \n    \n      Italia? \n    \n    \n      On - on  Friday.  \n    \n    \n      Which Friday?\n    \n    \n      This -  this  Friday.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Oh.  This  Friday?\n    \n    \n      Ugh. \n    \n    \n       This  Friday.\n    \n    \n      As in, four days?\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      Or, three days?\n    \n    \n      Is he - How long is he gone for?\n    \n    \n      Two weeks.\n    \n    \n      Italy, huh? \n    \n    \n      What's, uh - what's there?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Well, it's a country.\n    \n    \n      Buildings.\n    \n    \n      People.\n    \n    \n      But it's not a conference or anything. He's just visiting.\n    \n    \n      Pasta.\n    \n    \n      Hmm?\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Just visiting.\n    \n    \n      Vacation.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      It's a pretty nice place,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      in my brief, uh, encounter with it.\n    \n    \n      Do you guys - Oh, yeah. So.  Part  of what we actually  want  to do is sort of schedule out what we want to  surprise  him with when - when he comes  back. \n    \n    \n      Um, so -\n    \n    \n      Oh, I think we should disappoint him.\n    \n    \n      Yeah? You - or have a finished  construction   parser and a working belief-net, and uh -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       That  wouldn't be  disappointing.   \n    \n    \n      I think w- we should do absolutely no work\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      for the two weeks that he's gone.\n    \n    \n      Well, that's actually what  I  had planned,  personally.  I had - I - I had sort of scheduled out in my mind that  you  guys do a  lot  of work, and  I  do  nothing. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And then, I sort of -\n    \n    \n      Oh, yeah, that sounds good, too.\n    \n    \n      sort of bask in - in your glory.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      But, uh, i- do you guys have any vacation plans, because I  myself  am going to be,\n    \n    \n      um,\n    \n    \n      gone, but\n    \n    \n      this is actually  not   really important. Just this  weekend  we're going camping.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I'm wanna be this - gone this weekend, too. \n    \n    \n      Ah. \n    \n    \n      But we're  all  going to be here on  Tuesday  again?\n    \n    \n      Looks like it?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      O_K, then. Let's meet - meet again next Tuesday.\n    \n    \n      And, um,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      finish up this Bayes-net.\n    \n    \n      And once we have  finished  it,\n    \n    \n      I guess we can,\n    \n    \n      um -\n    \n    \n      and that's going to be more just you and  me, \n    \n    \n      because Bhaskara is doing probabilistic,\n    \n    \n      recursive,\n    \n    \n      structured,\n    \n    \n      object-oriented,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      uh,\n    \n    \n      Killing machines! \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       reasoning  machines.\n    \n    \n      Yes.\n    \n    \n      And, um -\n    \n    \n      Killing, reasoning. What's the difference?\n    \n    \n      Wait. So you're saying, next Tuesday, is it the whole group meeting, or just\n    \n    \n      Uh.\n    \n    \n      us three working on it, or - or - ? \n    \n    \n      The whole group.\n    \n    \n      And we present our results,\n    \n    \n      our  final, \n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n       definite  -\n    \n    \n      So, when you were saying we  need to do a re-run\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      of, like -\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      h- What?\n    \n    \n      What - Like, just working out the rest of the - \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yeah. We should do this th- the upcoming days.\n    \n    \n       This  week?\n    \n    \n      So,  this  week, yeah.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      When you say, \"the whole group\", you mean \n    \n    \n      the four of us, and Keith?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And,  Ami  might. \n    \n    \n      Ami might be here, and it's possible that Nancy'll be here?\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      So,\n    \n    \n      yeah.\n    \n    \n      Because, th- you know,\n    \n    \n      once we have the belief-net done -\n    \n    \n      You're just gonna have to\n    \n    \n      explain it to me, then, on Tuesday, how it's all gonna work out.\n    \n    \n       You  know.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       We  will.\n    \n    \n      O_K. Because then, once we have it sort of up and running, then we can  start   you know,\n    \n    \n      defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it, and then\n    \n    \n      hook it up to some\n    \n    \n      fake construction\n    \n    \n      parser and -\n    \n    \n      That you will have in about\n    \n    \n      nine months or so. Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And, um,\n    \n    \n      The first bad version'll be done in nine months.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I can worry about the ontology interface and you can - Keith can worry about the discourse. I mean, this is pretty - Um, I mean, I - I - I hope everybody uh  knows  that\n    \n    \n      these are just going to be uh  dummy  values, right?\n    \n    \n      Which - \n    \n    \n      where the -\n    \n    \n      Which ones?\n    \n    \n      S- so - so if the  endpoint  - if the  Go-there  is Yes and No, then Go-there- discourse  will just be fifty-fifty.\n    \n    \n      Right?\n    \n    \n      Um, what do you mean?  If  the Go-there says No, then the Go-there is -\n    \n    \n      I don't get it.\n    \n    \n      I don't u- understand.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      Like, the Go-there depends on all those four things.\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      But, what are the values of the Go-there- discourse? \n    \n    \n      Well, it depends on the situation. If the discourse is  strongly  indicating that -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, but, uh, we  have  no discourse input.\n    \n    \n      Oh,  I  see. The d- See, uh, specifically in our situation, D_ and O_ are gonna be, uh - Yeah. Sure. So, whatever.\n    \n    \n      So, so far we have -\n    \n    \n      Is that what the  Keith  node is?\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      O_K. And you're taking it out?  for now? Or - ? \n    \n    \n      Well, this is\n    \n    \n      D_ -\n    \n    \n      O_K, this, I can - I can get it in here.\n    \n    \n      All the  D_ 's are -\n    \n    \n      I can get it in here, so th- We have the, uh,\n    \n    \n      um,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n       sk-  let's - let's call it \"Keith-Johno\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      node\".\n    \n    \n      Johno? \n    \n    \n      There is\n    \n    \n      an H_ \n    \n    \n      somewhere  printed .\n    \n    \n       There  you go.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. People have the same problem with my name.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      Oops.  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And, um,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Does th- th- does the H_ go b-  before  the A_ or  after  the A_? \n    \n    \n       Oh, in  my  name?  Before  the A_.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      O_K,  good.  \n    \n    \n      Cuz you kn- When you said people have the same  problem,  I thought - Cuz  my  H_ goes  after  the uh e- e- e- the v-\n    \n    \n      People have the inverse problem with my name.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      I always have to  check, \n    \n    \n      every time y- I send you an email, \n    \n    \n      a past email of  yours,   to make sure I'm spelling your name correctly.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      That's good.\n    \n    \n      I  worry  about you.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I appreciate that.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      But, when you  abbreviate  yourself as the   \"Basman\"  , you don't use  any  H_'s.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \"Basman\"?  Yeah, it's because of the chessplayer named Michael Basman, who is my hero.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       You're  a  geek. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       It's  O_ K.  I- \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      How do you pronou-\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      How do you pronounce  your  name?\n    \n    \n       Eva.  \n    \n    \n      Eva? \n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Not  Eva?  \n    \n    \n      What if I were - What if I were to call you  Eva?  \n    \n    \n      I'd  probably  still respond to it.\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      I've had people call me  Eva,   but I don't know.\n    \n    \n      No, not just  Eva,    Eva.   Like if I u-\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      take the  V_  and s- pronounce it like it was a  German   V_ ?\n    \n    \n      Which is F_.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Um, no  idea  then.\n    \n    \n      Voiced.\n    \n    \n      What?\n    \n    \n      It sounds like an F_. There's also an F_ in German, which is why I -\n    \n    \n      I -\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Well, it's just the difference between voiced and unvoiced.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      As  long  as that's O_ K.  I mean, I might slip out and say it accidentally. That's all I'm saying.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      That's  fine.  \n    \n    \n      Yeah. It doesn't matter what those nodes are, anyway, because we'll just make the weights \"zero\" for now.\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      We'll make them zero for now,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      because it - who - who knows what they come up with,\n    \n    \n      what's gonna come in there.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      And, um,\n    \n    \n      then\n    \n    \n      should we start on Thursday?\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      And not meet tomorrow?\n    \n    \n      Sure.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      I'll send an email,\n    \n    \n      make a time suggestion.\n    \n    \n      Wait, maybe it's O_K, so that -\n    \n    \n      that - that we can - that we have one node per construction.\n    \n    \n      Cuz even in  people,  like, they don't know what you're  talking  about if you're using some sort of strange  construction. \n    \n    \n      Yeah, they would still c- sort of get the closest, best fit.\n    \n    \n      Well, yeah, but I mean, the - uh, I mean, that's what the construction parser would do. Uh, I mean, if you said something completely arbitrary, it would f- find the\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      closest construction, right? But if you said something that was completel- er - h- theoretically the construction parser would do that -\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      But if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever,\n    \n    \n      n- people wouldn't have any idea what you were talking about.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Like \"Bus dog fried egg.\" I mean.\n    \n    \n      You know.\n    \n    \n      Or, if  even  something Chinese, for example.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Or, something in Mandarin, yeah.\n    \n    \n      Or Cantonese, as the case may be.\n    \n    \n      What do you think about  that,  Bhaskara?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I mean -\n    \n    \n      Well -\n    \n    \n      But how many constructions do - could we possibly have \n    \n    \n      nodes for?\n    \n    \n      In  this  system, or in r-\n    \n    \n      No,  we.  Like, when people do this kind of thing.\n    \n    \n      Oh, when p- How many constructions do  people  have?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      I have not  the slightest idea. \n    \n    \n      Is it considered to be like in - are they considered to be like very, uh, sort of s- abstract things?\n    \n    \n      Every noun is a construction.\n    \n    \n      O_K, so it's like in the  thousands.\n    \n    \n      The - Yeah. \n    \n    \n      Any - any form- meaning  pair, to my understanding, is a construction.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      And form u- starts at the level of noun - Or actually, maybe even  sounds.  Yeah.\n    \n    \n       Phoneme.  Yep.\n    \n    \n      And goes upwards\n    \n    \n      until you get\n    \n    \n      the  ditransitive  construction.\n    \n    \n      And then, of course, the c- I guess, maybe there can be the -\n    \n    \n      S-\n    \n    \n      Can there be combinations of the dit-\n    \n    \n      Discourse-level \n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      constructions.\n    \n    \n      The \"giving a speech\" construction,\n    \n    \n      Rhetorical constructions. Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yes.\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      But, I mean,\n    \n    \n      you know, you can  probably  count -\n    \n    \n      count the ways.\n    \n    \n      I mean.\n    \n    \n      It's probab- Yeah, I would s- definitely say it's finite.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      And at least in compilers, that's all that really matters, as long as your analysis is finite.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      How's that?  How it can be finite, again?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Nah, I can't think of a way it would be  infinite. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Well, you can come up with  new  constructions.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      If the - if your - if your brain was totally non-deterministic,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      then perhaps there's a way to get, uh,\n    \n    \n      infin- an infinite number of constructions that you'd have to worry about.\n    \n    \n      But, I mean, in the  practical sense, it's impossible.\n    \n    \n      Right. Cuz if we have a fixed number of neurons - ? \n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      So the best-case scenario would be the number of constructions - or, the  worst-case  scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons.\n    \n    \n      Well, two to the power of the number of neurons.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      But  still \n    \n    \n       finite. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      No, wait. Not  necessarily,  is it?\n    \n    \n      We can end the  meeting. I just -\n    \n    \n       Can't you use different var- different levels of activation?\n    \n    \n      across, uh -\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      lots of different neurons, to specify different values?\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Um, yeah, but there's, like, a certain level of -\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      There's a bandwidth issue, right? Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Bandw- Yeah, so you can't do better than something.\n    \n    \n      Turn off the mikes. Otherwise it gets really tough for the tr- \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\n", "mode": "spoken", "name": "Bed012", "class": "face-to-face"}

What the heck are we gonna do about microphones?\n    \n    \n      So uh I got passed on that the E_D_U group doesn't like the\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Oh.\n    \n    \n      uh, Crown mikes.  I  do. I l- I think - I find them very comfortable. Uh, but it seems to depend on your head shape.\n    \n    \n      Who does? \n    \n    \n      I do.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I do too.\n    \n    \n      So you guys need to start going to the E_D_U meetings.\n    \n    \n      I see.\n    \n    \n      Yeah right.\n    \n    \n      They don't work for me very well. I much prefer these.\n    \n    \n      That's right.\n    \n    \n      Yep. Um,\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Me too.\n    \n    \n      So do I.\n    \n    \n      I  prefer  these, but I don't mind using those.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Th- those are intimidating.\n    \n    \n      So apparently they - they like\n    \n    \n      It has one good effect, that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       O_K.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Interesting.\n    \n    \n      People who show up late have to use  these.  So,\n    \n    \n      um, we should probably get different mikes. So the question is, the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more, um,\n    \n    \n       Sony  mikes.\n    \n    \n      Just two more of  those,  um. And that - that's easy and that will certainly work.\n    \n    \n      The other option is to try yet another mike.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Find one we like and potentially get  six,  all the  same. \n    \n    \n      I have a question about this.\n    \n    \n      Are the auditory quality - Is it, uh, much different between this kind and the - the fancy ones?\n    \n    \n      Um,  these  are better, if they're worn correctly.\n    \n    \n      They are.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Those are better than the Sonys?\n    \n    \n      Have you -\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, definitely.\n    \n    \n      Have you  listened  to - to  them?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      So, I mean, they're  not  a  lot  better, but they  are  a  little  better.\n    \n    \n      Are they more directional, the microphones, as far as -\n    \n    \n      Um, they're more directional, a little better error - uh, noise cancellation, and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth, like this, whereas that one, to avoid breath noise, you really have to put it at - to the side.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      So you seem to get better signal with this one.\n    \n    \n      The other thing is, is it just a few people who don't like them in the E_D_U group? Cuz -\n    \n    \n      I don't know, but - you know, in - in sort of random polling \n    \n    \n      L- Liz - Liz said something that leaves me believing that  nobody  likes them.\n    \n    \n      They are ver-\n    \n    \n      Gosh, cuz I  much  prefer them, I think they're a whole lot, multiple levels, better.\n    \n    \n      It seems a shame t- to discard -  discard  them if - if they're better auditory quality and there're only a few people who dis- who object.\n    \n    \n      I mean, so s-\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, that's why I was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in.\n    \n    \n      Well, I mean, that's the other option, is that we could switch the form so it's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike, um, and then get\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      You know, pretty -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      duplicates. I mean, there's no problem with that. It's just - what -\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      Should we get just more  Sony  ones? I  hate  the  Sony  ones.\n    \n    \n      Which ones are those?\n    \n    \n      b- the one you're wearing. Because it - it pinches -\n    \n    \n      The one I'm wearing? Oh.\n    \n    \n      Those.\n    \n    \n      pinches the  temples  too much.\n    \n    \n      Oh.\n    \n    \n       And -\n    \n    \n      I mean, so, if you  wear  it sort of around the  back,  it's not  too  bad.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      I hate it because it's hard to adjust the  microphone.  I mean, I spend all this time fumbling around with it and  still  not\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      But I -\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      reasonable, yeah.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      So, I mean, we could try another mike.\n    \n    \n      But then we have the wiring issue, and -   So I - I don't know  what  to do. What do - what do people think?\n    \n    \n      But the problem is again the - the plug, or - ? \n    \n    \n      Wh-\n    \n    \n      The plug is proprietary. So that's why I was saying getting more  Sony  ones is trivial, because we can just go out and buy them. Any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      O_K, n- now may- maybe I just don't know this but, um, are the only two possibilities from  Sony  the two that we've  tried?  Or is there another -\n    \n    \n      Yes.\n    \n    \n      So, the only possibilities from Sony are  that  one and the lapel mike.\n    \n    \n      I see. O_K.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Oh, I see.\n    \n    \n      So this isn't Sony. This is Crown. The one we're wearing.\n    \n    \n      Isn't that something. O_K.\n    \n    \n      And so we had these wired for us.\n    \n    \n      Oh. I see. O_K.\n    \n    \n      Well, it s- It seems like right  now  if - if u- what they're complaining are  those,  if we just got two more of  these  - \n    \n    \n      And so -\n    \n    \n      Huh, I remember that now.\n    \n    \n      I think that's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately, and have them available.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      And then they can just unplug those from the -\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      And just make sure that you write down \"Crown\" or \"Sony\" on the mike number, which I'll change to mike type, or something like that.\n    \n    \n      transmitter.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      It might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too, cuz that would be an easy place for, uh, an error in the data.\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      For it to be forgotten.\n    \n    \n      Well, it'll be me -\n    \n    \n      It'll be whoever's setting up the meeting, who fills out the key file, so\n    \n    \n      O_K, it's just - I'm just thinking that if - it'd be - yeah, but I know - but I mean to have the  user  fill it out wouldn't be as reliable as have the - \n    \n    \n      It has the same potential for error as everything else.\n    \n    \n      No, no, we definitely would  not  have the user fill it out. It would be me, Chuck, or Liz, depending on which meeting it is.\n    \n    \n      Good, O_K.\n    \n    \n      Perfect.\n    \n    \n      Perfect, O_K.\n    \n    \n      O_K, so we'll de- definitely go ahead and do that.\n    \n    \n      How much is it just to buy the mike?\n    \n    \n      Couple hundred.\n    \n    \n      Really.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Is that more or less than you thought?\n    \n    \n      It depends on how good the mike is.\n    \n    \n      Oh that's  way  more than I thought. I - yeah.\n    \n    \n      Oh, O_K.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      For one of  these? \n    \n    \n      Well the  Crown  ones were like two-fifty. I think  those  are like one-ninety.\n    \n    \n      God.\n    \n    \n      Oops.  \n    \n    \n      Wow!\n    \n    \n      But.\n    \n    \n      Is there any educational discount? \n    \n    \n      Yeah right. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      No. \n    \n    \n      Student discount.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, good mikes are expensive. So.\n    \n    \n      And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure, the S_M-ten-A's, and I  think  they were only like eighty  bucks  or something.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, eighty or ninety for the Shures. So.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. But they were - they seemed pretty good.\n    \n    \n      I mean, the  Sony  ones are expensive because they're proprietary, so they can charge whatever they want. These are expensive because they're quite high quality. So.\n    \n    \n      Oh.\n    \n    \n      Right, right.\n    \n    \n      So we should buzz  that out if we send the data to Sony.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Ah, come on.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      We should keep a list of things we're gonna bleep out and the conditions under which - \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Well, I'm just joking.\n    \n    \n      So, you do  not  have to bleep that out. I don't mind if Sony knows my opinion. So.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      Also, we're pro- I wanna double check with Morgan, he  did  say yes  before  I went to Japan on buying another wireless system so that we can go all wireless, instead of the mix of wired and wireless. And I think that's the right thing to do.\n    \n    \n      So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones?\n    \n    \n      And I'm -\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      Cool.\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n       Uh-huh. \n    \n    \n      Four more wireless.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      And also I'm gonna re-  probably  replace the Andrea mike with a Shure, but I'll test it, uh, sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the Shure one really works, cuz I have an extra Shure in my office.\n    \n    \n      The Andrea mike?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, apparently it's had some problems.\n    \n    \n      That's causing problems, yeah.\n    \n    \n      Which one is the Andrea mike?\n    \n    \n      It was over here sometimes.\n    \n    \n      A wired one?\n    \n    \n      The - yeah a wired one.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. It's uh -\n    \n    \n      Well, if you're gonna go to all wireless,\n    \n    \n      Oh, you mean in the meantime.\n    \n    \n      This one.\n    \n    \n      In the meantime, right, because uh -\n    \n    \n      Ah, I see.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      it'll - it'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from Sony anyway.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      I haven't - In the meetings that I recorded s-\n    \n    \n      So -\n    \n    \n      It's always been at most six people, so I've never had to -\n    \n    \n      Oh really? Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all.\n    \n    \n      I guess cuz everyone's been out of town. Probably over the summer it'll be the same cuz it tends to be less,\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      fewer people.\n    \n    \n      Um,\n    \n    \n      File -\n    \n    \n      Uh, done with microphone issues, I think?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Should we close the door?\n    \n    \n      If you want.\n    \n    \n      Oh, I'm thinking - I don't know about the acoustics. That's - that's all I was wondering about.\n    \n    \n      And this way we can get a door-slam in the uh - in the transcript file.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. \n    \n    \n      Yeah that's right, we gotta get the obligatory door-slam. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Oh well. No- not quite a slam.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      There's some knocks.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Get a special phone for that.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Uh, the door-slam phone?\n    \n    \n      I guess, right, the door-slam phone. \n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      You have a special phone?\n    \n    \n      No, we could add one.\n    \n    \n      Oh, we could add one, yeah.\n    \n    \n      And then we could have the  phone  phone,\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       That's an idea.\n    \n    \n      for - for when the phone rings.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Um,\n    \n    \n      Uh, file reorganization.\n    \n    \n      This is something we were talking about  before  I left and saying we should probably wait until  after  I'm  back,  and now I'm back, so, we should do that at some point. So we should\n    \n    \n      get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else.\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      Can I - can I just mention something?\n    \n    \n      Sure.\n    \n    \n      Um, uh, I think the file regards reorganization. Also, um, another issue there is disk space probably, right? Um, so\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      I know that the files that you've been cutting up for us\n    \n    \n      f- for the recognition experiments, uh, one way - one really\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      brain -\n    \n    \n      uh, brain-dead way of - of - of\n    \n    \n      not causing any trouble, but saving disk space is to, uh, use the s- the\n    \n    \n      Sphere, the NIST, uh, W_encode program.\n    \n    \n      to - to encode, you know, to compress them.\n    \n    \n      Shorten. Is that the same as shorten?\n    \n    \n      Uh, yeah, but it does it s- it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Well, O_K, you mean it's built into the S_R_I, because we have the same thing with shorten in the  sound  tools.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      Y- uh, I  guess,  but it\n    \n    \n      um,\n    \n    \n      So it's just a question of - of what decompression is built into your tools.\n    \n    \n      Well, it's -\n    \n    \n       Well like - Hhh. \n    \n    \n      It's actually built into the Sphere library that NIST delivers, so - Right.\n    \n    \n      Oh really? I didn't know that.\n    \n    \n      And actually, s- the sound tools  don't  understand that.\n    \n    \n      For the -\n    \n    \n      At least Feacalc doesn't.\n    \n    \n      At least  Feacalc  doesn't. So.\n    \n    \n      Well, that's not a sound tool, right.\n    \n    \n      But since - since these files are made to be used with the S_R_I recognizer,\n    \n    \n      uh and the S_R_I front-end uses the Sphere library which in turn does this\n    \n    \n      transparently\n    \n    \n      um,\n    \n    \n      uh, that will be a quick and -\n    \n    \n      quick and easy way to just, uh, get you know, uh, be able to use more -\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      The other thing I could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything\n    \n    \n      to my eighteen gig  disk,  which is local.\n    \n    \n      But that's gonna be only  temporary.  \n    \n    \n      Well,\n    \n    \n      I mean, I don't know -\n    \n    \n      I mean, you should do that too,\n    \n    \n      probably, but - but as you do that you can also just run the -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, it is kind of a temporary solution.\n    \n    \n      To shorten everything.\n    \n    \n      well, actually, the - th- what you do is you run -\n    \n    \n      Oh, now I have another use for the - \n    \n    \n      The way I recently used it, and there might be better ways - So the program's called W_encode.\n    \n    \n      Mmm.\n    \n    \n      And I think the type, y- you say um\n    \n    \n      I think dash T_ and then there are different -\n    \n    \n      different encoding methods, but if you wanna use the shorten one, you say d- \"minus T_ shorten\",\n    \n    \n      and then the old\n    \n    \n      uh wavefile and the  new \n    \n    \n      wavefile, and then - Oops!  And then I check, you know, if this works, so, you can use the -\n    \n    \n      the shell \"AND\" operator or something.\n    \n    \n      Then I just move the\n    \n    \n      new wavefile to the,\n    \n    \n      you know, to the old\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      wavefile, and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      decode it on the fly.\n    \n    \n      And that -\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      that just saved my butt because I actually was running - On a different experiment, I had\n    \n    \n      segmented -\n    \n    \n      I was processing the whole Switchboard-two corpus, which is two hundred eighty hours of speech,\n    \n    \n      and I was noticing, as I was\n    \n    \n      almost finishing the processing, that I was running out of disk space. \n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      And - and so\n    \n    \n      I uh had this flash of inspiration of just uh the same - the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them, so I -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Shortening everything on the fly. \n    \n    \n      while this other thing was still going  on,  I was run- I was running this -  this  thing. \n    \n    \n      You had another process running that was shortening it. Yep.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Wow, wow!\n    \n    \n      And low and behold I gained three g- three gig of space and um, you know -  \n    \n    \n      Wow!\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Did you have to re-nice one of the processes to make sure that \"shorten\"?\n    \n    \n      No, no.  Actually it was fast enough. This is very fast. This - this really runs quickly. And that's -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Wow.\n    \n    \n      That must have been suspenseful. \n    \n    \n       Watching the disk meter.\n    \n    \n      That was  very   suspenseful.  That was - that was the most excitement I had all weekend. Uh, uh boy, it uh  came out just fine. So. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      To be O_K. \n    \n    \n      You know what would be a -\n    \n    \n      u- I don't know if this would mess other things up, but -\n    \n    \n      It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around. What would be easier would be like pointers.\n    \n    \n      The list, yep.\n    \n    \n      You know, lists like \"original wavefile, start, end\".\n    \n    \n      Start end.\n    \n    \n      This is -\n    \n    \n      Yep, the way  Feacalc   - calc does it.\n    \n    \n      Right, the - the only reason we do this is because the - the S_R_I front-end doesn't have a way to - to um \n    \n    \n      go into a l- a longer file with indices.\n    \n    \n      Um, so I - I suppose\n    \n    \n      And segment on the fly. \n    \n    \n      someone could try to put a hack like that into the - \n    \n    \n      It would be easy.\n    \n    \n      It wouldn't be hard at all. Someone just needs to d- sit down and do it who has some time.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      But there's also some - I guess -\n    \n    \n      And that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around. About the only difficulty with that is if it's  compressed. \n    \n    \n      Then you really  do  have to decompress it  first. \n    \n    \n      That's true.\n    \n    \n      Right? Because the pointers are -\n    \n    \n      Y- you don't know how much it's comp-\n    \n    \n      Well, is there - is there - is there a NIST routine which\n    \n    \n      It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount.\n    \n    \n      Exactly. Right right right right right.\n    \n    \n      can seek\n    \n    \n      in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices?\n    \n    \n      I don't think so.\n    \n    \n      And  yeah I mean, that - it -\n    \n    \n      No, no. I mean, if you -\n    \n    \n      Th- the - the - the -\n    \n    \n      If you can operate on the full -\n    \n    \n      If you  don't  have to  segment  it, then there would be less of a reason to do the  compression,  because you don't have that wasted -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      that extra  copy.  So.\n    \n    \n      Right we - I mean the original  Switchboard  files are not compressed, right? So we could leave those as they  are. \n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Well, I mean, it just depends on how much disk space is a problem. I mean the - what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      But.\n    \n    \n      I mean, the segmentation also  saves  you space in the sense that you cut out all the  nonspeech  regions.\n    \n    \n      Just silences, yeah.\n    \n    \n      And if you have, you know, twenty channels and only five speakers, then it's -\n    \n    \n      That's true.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Well, assuming you'd - Yeah. Assuming that you then off-load the original\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Switchboard files.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Mmm.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Well, it seems like just shortening them is a good short-term solution so we don't have to do any coding.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      But I think - kind of - We've had - There was a big disk crash when you were gone and -\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      No, it was - I was still here. It was the day I left. \n    \n    \n      Oh was that the day you left?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      That's suspicious.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      He did it on purpose.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Leave to Japan the day the disk crashes.\n    \n    \n      No if I - if I had done it on purpose I would have timed it right  after  I left. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      But, um - Yeah so, Chuck helped me out in, uh, r-\n    \n    \n      regenerating all the cha- the different channel files for like a few meetings - for like six meetings. So I think they're split up even further. It's kind of even more disorganized now since\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      we moved some of the meetings to different directories.\n    \n    \n      They're on a different disk even, right?\n    \n    \n      Are they?\n    \n    \n      I think - you - didn't you expand them to X_E on Abbott?\n    \n    \n      X_F.\n    \n    \n      No, you - the ones that\n    \n    \n      Oh, different ones?\n    \n    \n      You - the ones that you put them on when you put them on X_E.\n    \n    \n      I don't remember where I put them now.\n    \n    \n      I think you put them on X_E. So.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Well what we - what we found out was that um the disk that crashed\n    \n    \n      was - it - w- with a - with a meta disk allocation, you had both c- t- transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on X_E - were on the same - sorry, different partitions of the same physical disk.\n    \n    \n      Physical disk.\n    \n    \n      Mmm.\n    \n    \n      And it's conceivable I mean, I - I don't - I mean, so um, I was told that it's  possible  that that might have, uh, caused additional wear on it. Maybe caused it to - to go bad sooner.\n    \n    \n      Well, I think there was something else going on, because uh Dave Johnson said that D_D was getting accessed  frequently.  And it  shouldn't  be.\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      Oh. Uh-huh.\n    \n    \n      Right? That data never gets touched, because we write it once and then we never touch it again.\n    \n    \n      Well, why not?\n    \n    \n      Oh sure it does.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, after each meeting we copy the data to -\n    \n    \n      Except that -\n    \n    \n      Well, I mean, so the wavefiles, or - or anything at all, because the transcripts are there as well.\n    \n    \n      The wave files.\n    \n    \n      I mean, he was saying gigabytes.\n    \n    \n      Oh, gigabytes. I see.\n    \n    \n      And so, it has to be the wave files.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, there  was  something weird about that.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, that's right.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet, but we should definitely double check on it.\n    \n    \n      Yeah like - like the same\n    \n    \n      meeting - shortened, files that we pull off of Popcorn when we're done doing the recording,\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      looked,\n    \n    \n      to the  backup  software, as if they had been written,\n    \n    \n      you know, every single  night, \n    \n    \n      Every night.\n    \n    \n      Is that right.\n    \n    \n      i- for - f- you know, a week in a  row,  which is really weird.\n    \n    \n      That's  very  strange. I didn't realize that. O_K.\n    \n    \n      Wow.\n    \n    \n      So at any rate, so for file reorganization we need to  first  decide what we're gonna do and then when we're gonna do it.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      So I'm not sure who isn't involved with that. I mean, certainly me, Chuck and Jane. Anyone else  care?\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And I - and I'd like, in terms of the conventions, to also, uh, you know, s- send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it's - if there's any - get his input on it. I don't think - I don't think that'll be - Yeah.\n    \n    \n      No.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      So, maybe we should do that\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n       not  during this meeting but s- another time, and just get a list of everything we're gonna do.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Maybe n- next week if we  could.  I'm trying to finish up some stuff.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Yeah sure. I'd like to -\n    \n    \n      So just update all the naming conventions and\n    \n    \n      put all the files where they really belong, on one disk,\n    \n    \n      That sounds like a good idea.\n    \n    \n      and then leave - leave everything in place until the back-up - until the next full back-up and then delete the old ones.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      O_K, now - and you're just - you're not talking about the s- the X_ disks - the X_ uh partitions, just the backed up space, or - ? \n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      Well,  both  need to be reorganized.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      So um,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      various paths, th- I mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way, because um\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I think we should also at the same time try to, uh, convert over to your new naming conventions.\n    \n    \n      Yes,\n    \n    \n      exactly. That too.\n    \n    \n      That'd be good.\n    \n    \n      So that's what I was saying. We need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      And so\n    \n    \n      I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out, so I assume that's alright with everyone.\n    \n    \n      I actually haven't looked at it yet. I haven't had a chance, so. \n    \n    \n      No.\n    \n    \n      Hmm. \n    \n    \n      I haven't either. Sorry. \n    \n    \n      Oh.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n       And -\n    \n    \n      I will by next  week,  though. \n    \n    \n      Uh, I don't know about the naming, I mean,\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Then I should have made that as an agenda item.\n    \n    \n      Th- so these names that we've been using so far are with uh\n    \n    \n      uh\n    \n    \n      uh\n    \n    \n      I wouldn't just wanna change them\n    \n    \n      you know, without some advance notice.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      I mean, th- that's all these  segment  names that we- we've been using. I would rather not mess with them\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I'm -\n    \n    \n      until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      dealing with, so -\n    \n    \n      Well, I mean, how  you  choose to do it - the naming is up to you.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Well,\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      You're talking about different files.\n    \n    \n      I mean, it should probably be -  eventually  should probably be consistent with what you're doing but,\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      yeah, I kind of agree with Andreas, like I'm a little bit -\n    \n    \n      I mean, these -\n    \n    \n      I  looked  at the naming conventions and they look fine to me, but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be -\n    \n    \n      Well, if we -\n    \n    \n      If  we  change things, it won't really affect what  you're  doing, will it?\n    \n    \n      This -\n    \n    \n      No but I think just to be consistent we should also, I mean, have the same conventions, just in case you want -\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. So you - but you can switch that any time you want, right?\n    \n    \n      Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's only gonna affect my work. So.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, it's not gonna -\n    \n    \n      I mean, if we -\n    \n    \n      I assume you're not gonna go, like, into, you know,  my  directories and change  my  file names. So. Yeah. \n    \n    \n       Everybody will use it.  Fine slash U_ slash star. \n    \n    \n      Right. \n    \n    \n      I - Actually I was gonna do a global search-replace on all entries at -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      at ICSI to change M_R to M_R_M at all places at ICSI. \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yeah, that'd be great.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Really enjoy that.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      With no - with no advance warning.\n    \n    \n      Y- you -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Well, maybe I shouldn't say that on re- record.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      There was a\n    \n    \n      typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      one of our sponsors, did a global sear- search and replace for - between \"sponsor\" and  their  name.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n       Oh no, oh no.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      And so, it - it was saying, uh -\n    \n    \n      Well, anyway, I won't -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, one - one can imagine that that might be problematic. \n    \n    \n      I'm not sure whether that's right.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Yeah, one can imagine the problems that that would  engender.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      But this - this name change affects a subset, doesn't need to reflect everything, yeah.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Um,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Thilo, you had - you wanted to talk about the -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I had one - one short point. I have just installed a Transcriber version on one of our N_T machines so it's available under Windows now.\n    \n    \n      Oh great. Actually someone - I just got an email this week from someone as-\n    \n    \n      Isn't that great?\n    \n    \n      Yeah I re- responded to sh- I have already responded to him. I - I don't know what - what - what he - what the problem was. It was really straightforward, really easy.\n    \n    \n      To Anant?\n    \n    \n      And this is not - Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Oh, I'm sorry, I - I just - So, who did you talk to?\n    \n    \n      There was some - some guy from S_R_I who wanted to - to install - Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Anant?\n    \n    \n      Anant Venkataraman? O_K.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      And he sent an email that he couldn't - couldn't install it and I - I just described him, well, what I did and it was really straightforward, so.   \n    \n    \n      Yeah, O_K. Great.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, O_K.\n    \n    \n      Great. Great. Thanks. Thanks.\n    \n    \n      And this is not just the Transcriber, this is the Channeltrans, right?\n    \n    \n      Yeah, it's the Channeltrans, so the -\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, excellent.\n    \n    \n      the\n    \n    \n      Cool.\n    \n    \n      things that Dave Gelbart -\n    \n    \n      Excellent.\n    \n    \n      So you should probably talk to a Sys Admin and get it put in some central place.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      So that it'll work on all the N_T machines.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Well, I mean, as it stands, I - I guess - yeah I see what you mean. It'll - it'll be on the - on the UNIX side but accessible through the H_drive. Yeah.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      I've -\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      O_K. Yeah. I could do that.\n    \n    \n      So I assume Tcl-T_K wasn't already on the machine, so you had to install it. Yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I had i- to install it, yeah.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Huh. Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Uh\n    \n    \n      So Andreas, would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going?\n    \n    \n      Uh -\n    \n    \n      Oh, well, yeah I - I - I actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it, because it has uh very little to do with - with  meeting  recordings, but\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n        you know, I did uh run \n    \n    \n      um some recognition experiments with ICSI  front-end. \n    \n    \n      Um\n    \n    \n      Uh, and - and you know, this is the j- joint work with Chuck, and uh,\n    \n    \n      um.\n    \n    \n      So, first,\n    \n    \n      uh, you know, we had -\n    \n    \n      we figured out sometime last week how to\n    \n    \n      um -\n    \n    \n      and - and Chuck wrote this really nice little\n    \n    \n      script - Perl script that\n    \n    \n      takes a uh waveform, runs the feature calculation\n    \n    \n      and then dumps it out into the - into um\n    \n    \n      a f- c- so-called\n    \n    \n      uh cepstra file, which is what the S_R_I system uses to read features. It's essentially uh\n    \n    \n      uh NIST headered\n    \n    \n      uh waveform. You know, it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have  feature  vectors following the header.\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      And um that's all done\n    \n    \n      um\n    \n    \n      by the script, and it works great. And\n    \n    \n      uh I first trained up two\n    \n    \n      systems, because it's gender-dep- you know, the S_R_I system is gender-dependent so to be comparable, I trained uh um on a sh- on a so-called short training set\n    \n    \n      um\n    \n    \n      a male system and a female system,\n    \n    \n      and\n    \n    \n      uh also for debugging purposes, and for the heck of it, I trained um -\n    \n    \n      trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the  S_R_I  front-end from  scratch, \n    \n    \n      um, and compared the two -\n    \n    \n      So, w- what features did you use?\n    \n    \n      Well, we used, uh, twelve P_L_P uh, uh -\n    \n    \n      So not RASTA, just P_L_P.\n    \n    \n      Just P_L_P.\n    \n    \n      Just P_L_P and actually that - uh, one of the questions I had was what the RASTA would possibly buy us. But um, we'll\n    \n    \n      talk about that later. So, the uh - so the baseline system - w- the S_R_I system was - uh used - uh also uh uh used t- twelve uh mel - uh mel cepstra\n    \n    \n      um  based on a twenty-four filter bank\n    \n    \n      um analysis.\n    \n    \n      Um\n    \n    \n      I do  not \n    \n    \n      know what - So the f- the bandwidth of the um\n    \n    \n       S_R_I  front-end is from hundreds hertz to th- th- thirty-se- thirty-seven fifty or something like that.\n    \n    \n      Thirty-seven fifty.\n    \n    \n      And I do not know what the um\n    \n    \n      ICSI um\n    \n    \n      front-end would do. I mean, what the bandwidth is.\n    \n    \n      Um,\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      but the results are such that uh, let's see -\n    \n    \n      There's one other slight difference, right? Or two -  two  differences.\n    \n    \n      Oh yeah. So the S_R_I system also does um\n    \n    \n      vocal tract length normalization and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features. So that's one difference. And the other difference is that\n    \n    \n      in the, uh -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      in the S_R_I system,\n    \n    \n      the uh th- the first - the C_zero, the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest. And what they do is\n    \n    \n      Huh.\n    \n    \n      they d- they subtract the maximum -\n    \n    \n      For each waveform segment\n    \n    \n      they subtract the maximum of - of th- over that waveform segment from\n    \n    \n      from the values of - for that waveform.\n    \n    \n      Which is a kind of automatic gain control, that is localized -\n    \n    \n      Do they subtract the max from each i- one or do they subtract each one from the max?\n    \n    \n       Who cares?\n    \n    \n      They subtract -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Doesn't matter?\n    \n    \n      No, just would be a sign change.\n    \n    \n      Except you get a lot of negatives the other way. \n    \n    \n      Right,  right, right. Um, and  then,  after - But after they done this waveform based normalization, they  then  do a  conversation  length normalization just like all the other features.\n    \n    \n      So it's their kind of two stage normalization.\n    \n    \n      Oh! \n    \n    \n      Oh! \n    \n    \n      Um now, I understand that the common practice  here  has been to just do c- standard uh mean subtraction, um on the waveform.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      For the C_zero.\n    \n    \n      Right. But in what  we've  done so far, because we didn't have any special provision for  C_zero , we just treat it as - as any of the  other  features, we've done standard mean subtraction over the whole\n    \n    \n      conversation side.\n    \n    \n      So\n    \n    \n      um since both S_R_I and ICSI use this sort of local normalization for C_zero that's presumably, you know, someone has done some experiments to - and found out that that works better.\n    \n    \n      Um, so that's another difference, and that might account for some of the\n    \n    \n      discrepancies in the results. Um, but you know. So the\n    \n    \n      the  results  are \n    \n    \n       um\n    \n    \n      Where should I start? Uh\n    \n    \n      the -\n    \n    \n      So there's a two -\n    \n    \n      Oh. I tried it  with  and  without.  Uh.\n    \n    \n      So  without \n    \n    \n      and with  adaptation. \n    \n    \n      How many iterations?\n    \n    \n      For the adaptation?\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      Well, y- we always do three E_M iterations to\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      and it's - it's this - it's this quick and dirty -\n    \n    \n      the  phone  loop adaptation which doesn't actually require prior recognition paths and - and so this is not the best you can  do  with adaptation, but it gives you sort of a first\n    \n    \n      idea of what you could gain with it.\n    \n    \n      And then, you know, so we have the\n    \n    \n      the S_R_I front-end\n    \n    \n      and the ICSI front-end\n    \n    \n      and other than that the system configuration was identical. So it was the same -\n    \n    \n      They came up with um\n    \n    \n      you know, same number of uh Gaussians per state cluster\n    \n    \n      Um, same - The clustering used the same information loss threshold, which actually led to roughly the same number of Gaussians overall. So that the system configuration is - is comparable.\n    \n    \n      Um, and the -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Uh, so  without  adaptation,\n    \n    \n      you had forty-nine p-\n    \n    \n      That's error rate or recognition rate?\n    \n    \n      This is error rate\n    \n    \n      in percent.\n    \n    \n      And\n    \n    \n      with adaptation\n    \n    \n      it's forty-seven point one\n    \n    \n      and\n    \n    \n      this - this was fifty-two point six.\n    \n    \n      and\n    \n    \n      fifty-one point three\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      and then, when I combined them - I can actually combine them with\n    \n    \n      something like ROVER. It's actually more sophisticated than ROVER but it's - \n    \n    \n      Um, here I got\n    \n    \n      forty-eight point five\n    \n    \n      and here I got forty-six point five.\n    \n    \n      So this is just combination at the utterance level.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      At the utterance level, right.\n    \n    \n      Why do you think the ICSI front-end is so much  worse? \n    \n    \n      Good  question.    That's fine .\n    \n    \n      That seems really odd to me.\n    \n    \n      Um, so, one percent I would attribute to the lack of V_T_L, about one percent. O_K.\n    \n    \n      Oh right. Right, right, right.\n    \n    \n      O_K. Ah O_K.\n    \n    \n      And then maybe another up - I don't know how much the C_zero normalization business really matters I can't it see, I mean can't see it - the \n    \n    \n      Ca- can you run the S_R_I - Just as an experiment, run the S_R_I front-end without vocal tract norma- normalization, and see how much difference it makes?\n    \n    \n      I  could.  Yeah.\n    \n    \n      I could certainly do that. Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      We could  also  do the vocal tract length normalization with the  ICSI  features. That's something we wanted to do - yeah. We could - I was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the M_F_C_C's\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      If we could figure out how.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      and just try them with the ICSI\n    \n    \n      uh front-end. Because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um -\n    \n    \n      to the P_L_P c-  uh Dan added the  -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, Dan added that in, but -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, but the -\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      They won't -\n    \n    \n      they don't correspond one-to- one  though.\n    \n    \n      No, but they  should  be\n    \n    \n       close,  since this -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I mean the -\n    \n    \n      Anyway. But I can certainly try the S_R_I front-end without uh V_T_L. That sh- that's - that's certainly quick to do.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Um\n    \n    \n      and so -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, and - and then there's all these um -\n    \n    \n      You know, the number of um -\n    \n    \n      You know, this  front-end \n    \n    \n      u- had a fair amount of experimentation going into it. You know, how many\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      filter banks do you use, what - what bandwidth do you use, and stuff like that. And uh we could play the same kind of games with the  ICSI  front-end.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Uh, actually, the  analysis  bandwidth played a very crucial role. We used to use a narrow bandwidth and\n    \n    \n      uh\n    \n    \n      uh that hurt us. So this is, um - And this is - We've now used roughly what everybody else is using. So\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      um, there's some room for improvements, I figure, in this - in the ICSI front-end.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      But the good news is that even with this - with the ICSI system being that much  worse,  you still get a win out of  combining  the two.\n    \n    \n      So that gives some hope for the future.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      Unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation, so.\n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      Also interestingly\n    \n    \n      the -\n    \n    \n      Um, the difference actually  widens.  I would actually expect it or - or  hope  that the adaptation  reduces  the difference  because it might\n    \n    \n      um, for instance,\n    \n    \n      um\n    \n    \n      remove some of the um -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      You know, som- If you - if you have some - some difference in the front-end processing that\n    \n    \n      uh is suboptimal, but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the\n    \n    \n      um\n    \n    \n      moving the models around. But - but apparently that doesn't -\n    \n    \n      doesn't really - actually the difference becomes larger, so.\n    \n    \n      Um. Anyway. So right now what I'm doing is um -\n    \n    \n      Uh well, there's several things going on. One is that Chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem - the system on the tandem features. So that would actually be the\n    \n    \n      more  interesting  experiment.\n    \n    \n      Um, the other thing is I'm training\n    \n    \n      uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models and then we can -\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      And I actually  want  to\n    \n    \n      do the  system  combination\n    \n    \n      um  with  our  eval  system um, on some subset of the data at least, probably only for the males, because I don't have time to train both males and females, but um.\n    \n    \n      Uh and um -\n    \n    \n      What about ta-\n    \n    \n      concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one?\n    \n    \n      It gets pretty big.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      It  does  get pretty big. Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      And m- my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better.\n    \n    \n      Hmm.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      For - for whatever that's worth.\n    \n    \n      Oh, you tried that on Broadcast News? Concatenating\n    \n    \n      Oh yeah.\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n    \n      So w- Yep.\n    \n    \n      different feature sets? Yeah.\n    \n    \n      Did you try uh -\n    \n    \n      It was mostly M_S_G, P_L_P, RASTA.\n    \n    \n      I see.\n    \n    \n      So, you know, the feature sets we had available. And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level. You know, so we'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities.\n    \n    \n      I see.\n    \n    \n      O_K.\n    \n    \n      Alright.\n    \n    \n      Oh.\n    \n    \n      Yeah, and it  does  become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors. And that would\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      blow up the\n    \n    \n      You'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards\n    \n    \n      uh -\n    \n    \n      so that they're uh orthogonal.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      So you'd wanna do a linear transform also.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Um\n    \n    \n      so\n    \n    \n      the - Yeah, and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the ICSI front-end to perform better.\n    \n    \n      Um. And - and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can - I can certainly run a S_R_I system without V_T_L\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      just uh to get -\n    \n    \n      Wi- without what? Without V_T_L. O_K.\n    \n    \n      Just -\n    \n    \n      Vocal tract thing, yeah.\n    \n    \n      Wh- Yeah.\n    \n    \n      And that - that's quick to do.\n    \n    \n      So.\n    \n    \n      I was thinking about\n    \n    \n      tandem system - Well, let's not talk about it here, but I had some thoughts about the tandem system.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      yeah so but things are moving ahead, so\n    \n    \n      O_K, should we do digits?\n    \n    \n      Digits.

I actually have one more thing that - I don't know if it's - i- if - if it's allowed to - to bring up after the dis-\n    \n    \n      After digits, I don't know.\n    \n    \n      Anyway.\n    \n    \n      But it might be important. For um - So Liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where\n    \n    \n      Go ahead.\n    \n    \n      it was later found that several of the\n    \n    \n      s- microphones were turned off, um\n    \n    \n      Mm-hmm.\n    \n    \n      and this must become a problem especially with non-speech-meetings.\n    \n    \n      So um\n    \n    \n      is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from\n    \n    \n      some of the channels, or - ? \n    \n    \n      Probably. We could probably build that in to the front-end.\n    \n    \n      Because it - you know it's really annoying if you go through all that trouble and then basically the meetings aren't useable because uh even -\n    \n    \n      What are people doing, they're switching their mikes off or something?\n    \n    \n      I don't  know  what they do. Maybe the batteries went dead, or th- they just didn't - they played with the thing and it didn't leave it in the \"on\" position or whatever.\n    \n    \n      I don't know, uh eh. Fff. \n    \n    \n      What would you like it to  do  when that happens? \n    \n    \n      Well, no, if - if you um - I mean obviously you always -\n    \n    \n      I mean, there's never gonna be a signal from all the channels, right? because - or  rarely. \n    \n    \n      Um.\n    \n    \n      But uh.\n    \n    \n      Well if an unblacked out channel is zero, is actually spitting out zeros, you can be pretty sure it's  off. \n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Because it doesn't spit out zeros, it spits out epsilons.\n    \n    \n      Right? Cuz there's little background noise. The question is, when the software  detects  it, what do you want it to  do? \n    \n    \n      Exactly.\n    \n    \n      That's a good  question.  I don't  know.  But is there some - We can collectively think of some - of some mechanism that might reduce the risk of - of just -\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      I mean, it - it - it -\n    \n    \n      We - we  already  have visual feedback, right? You can  see  whether your mike is working or not. Um.\n    \n    \n      Right.\n    \n    \n      Right. So maybe it's just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal.\n    \n    \n      Yep.\n    \n    \n      Test -\n    \n    \n      Turn off the screen saver during the meeting.\n    \n    \n      Tell them to test their mikes, or -\n    \n    \n      Yeah, something.\n    \n    \n      I think they sh-\n    \n    \n      Yeah, I d- I don't know what to do other than -\n    \n    \n      It - it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording.\n    \n    \n      There's no sound out right now.\n    \n    \n      Oh.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Never mind.\n    \n    \n      It should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting.\n    \n    \n      Yep. Yep. Yeah yeah. That would be good. Well, we can think about what to do about it, but it -\n    \n    \n      Oh yeah. That's a good one.\n    \n    \n      Wow, that's not a bad idea.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. O_K.\n    \n    \n      It's pretty clear we  can  detect it, so.\n    \n    \n      Yeah. Alright.\n    \n    \n      O_K. Are we done?\n    \n    \n      Yeah.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n", "mode": "spoken", "name": "Bmr021", "class": "face-to-face"}

Who are you? \n\n             That's a scary question. As for the first, not specifically I\n                identify myself as being in between group of people, kind of like being one foot in\n                each water, or like linked to different groups. \n\n             And which groups are those? \n\n             Well you would need to define group. \n\n             Well lets say culture. What cultures do you identify with and\n                why? \n\n             Cultural groups being European not French because both of my\n                parents arent french with a certain warmth towards American and Russian Culture the\n                warmth could be described as family attachement. \n\n             But not in the cultural sense as in you feel national pride Do\n                feel a national attachement to american or Russia? As in political movements,\n                traditions etc. \n\n             Probably because these are two cultures representative of my\n                childhood, the mother and father figure well, childhood memories, passport. \n\n             What aspects exactly do you identify with each culture/country? \n\n             Transmission of tradition The cultural backround of Europe the\n                passion and emotionnal side to Russia like my soul feels Russian I feel European\n                with a zest of Americanism. \n\n             How exactly do you define that emotion and passion? \n\n             So how do you define yourself as being a citizen of the world, \n                free spirited and universal. \n\n             What exactly is a citizen of the world? How do you define that? \n\n             Someone who has been raised with multiple nationals and that\n                adopts a more international perspective. Someone who does not have strong\n                nationalist pride And feels more connected to people in general. \n\n             And so in your opinion do you believe that being from two\n                different backgrouns has helped you achieve this... identity? \n\n             Well not only being from two different backgrounds but being\n                born in a third one. My father is American, My mom is Russian But I was born in\n                France. \n\n             How did those two happen to reside in France \n\n             Circumstances. Allright I'll say it. \n\n             Yes, please. \n\n             My mom after living in Russia at that time USSR moved to\n                Germany with her family finishing her high school. When she was around 18-19, she\n                decided to move to Paris not liking life in Germany. At that time, my father was\n                working closely on projects regarding the construction of oil pipelines in the\n                Caucasus and flew constantly to Russia Being between the US and Russia, he needed to\n                stay somewhere in between and decided to live in Paris They met randomly in Monaco\n                at that time and decided to stay in France. Before I was born, they would constantly\n                travel to Russia and New York. \n\n             Do you know what language they spoke together? Did your father\n                speak Russian? \n\n             English / Russian So, yes it would depend on circumstances. My\n                dad spoke russian since he was a kid, having a Russian Nanny. \n\n             Did he speak any other languages? \n\n             English, French, Chinese fluently and a couple more. My father\n                was born and raised in China till age 13. \n\n             Can you tell me about your father? \n\n             So... The reason I consider myself citizen of the world is\n                because I come from a family that has moved every generation. My father was born and\n                raised in China, his family being American, originally from New York. However with\n                the war with the Japanese and the advent of Mao Tse Tung rise, all of their wealth\n                was confiscated by the state and they were encouraged to leave. My father then took\n                a boat to the US where he pursued high school and college. My mother was born and\n                raised in Russia with German origins. Germans migrated to Russia in the 19th Century\n                because the Queen at that time needed skillful workers for her ambitious tastes. She\n                lived on the border of the Oural, the mountains, which bring to Siberia, in the\n                artic circle. She then moved to Germany with her family It seems that I am\n                continuing that family trend of hours of moving abroad. After all I was born and\n                raised in France but recently moved to New York. Although part of my roots reside\n                here, it is still life changing. When I was little, I always had the feeling I\n                wasn\u2019t as everyone else because I never spoke French at home. I would speak Russian\n                and English at home with both my mom and dad While using French at school. Now most\n                of the kids I was friends with have double nationalities or are pluricultural. \n\n             Do you remember feeling different as a child because of this? \n\n             This progressively forged me into having this idea that I have\n                nothing in me that is French but my roots lie in Europe. I think my generation is\n                one of the first of our time to have a European sentiment, feeling like they are\n                part of a European culture. Of course I'm not saying that the majority of my\n                generation feels that way, we are a minority but, the whole feeling isn\u2019t merely\n                avant garde anymore, Its foundation is solid and expanding This feeling of being\n                pluricultural is hard to digest during your teenage years. You feel like being\n                inadequate, not part of everything but the more you grow and gain in maturity, the\n                stronger those foundations which gives you global perspective, great asset in our\n                times Furthermore, having a more of a global cultural identity has prompt me to\n                travel a lot and discover other cultures which in time strengthens the feeling of\n                being part of humanity as a whole. To understand that right and wrong can be a\n                cultural, social or religious view. In the end it all depends from which angle you\n                perceive the subject from \n\n             What do you think has made it expand? Globalization? So during\n                your childhood do you have any memories of your first language? Which one was first? \n\n             Tricky question. I don\u2019t have any memory whatsoever of what my\n                first language was. My dad always spoke to me in English. My mom always spoke to me\n                in Russian. Had both Russian and American nannies. And to keep the language going\n                I'd be taken care of during summer by American students. \n\n             Did you visit Russia ever as a child? \n\n             Because Russian was a language I would only use with family as\n                a child. When I was 5 I thought Russian was a family language. My parents and I\n                would fly from time to time to Russia. \n\n             Do you remember what that was like? What were your impressions\n                of Russia? \n\n             Once when I was around 5, upon getting there, everyone spoke\n                Russian. So I turned to my mom and told her \"we have a really big family\". \n\n             That\u2019s cute. \n\n             Hard to describe my impressions of Russia. \n\n             Well what do you remember about it? \n\n             I still have the USSR vision of Russia. I remember tanks and\n                army on the highways the cold and snow in a big park. \n\n             Did that seem really strange to you compared with France? \n\n             Well not really, when you are young you do not really take\n                those things into account. You more or less take them for granted. \n\n             When was the last time you went there? \n\n             All I remember is that at that time because there were soldiers\n                all around, I thought Russia was a mighty country. \n\n             In 1992 or 1993. \n\n             Oh so you were about 10 years old? \n\n             Indeed. \n\n             Would you go to visit family? \n\n             No, most of my family moved to Germany. I would go there for\n                business purposes. My dad had an office there. My mom and I would accompany him. \n\n             I see, working with the Russian pipelines? \n\n             Oil pipelines in the Caucasus. At that time it wasn\u2019t merely\n                Russia. It was the Soviet Union. That\u2019s what I meant. Everything was centralized in\n                Moscow. \n\n             So is your family religious at all? Your last name sounds very\n                Jewish. \n\n             Not exactly, spiritual would be the more appropriate term. I\n                have Jewish origins from my father's side but he was never religious. \n\n             So neither of your parents was very religious? \n\n             My mom is catholic and would go every once in a while to church\n                like on Christmas or Easter. I was baptized in Moscow in an Orthodox church then did\n                my communion in a catholic church. \n\n             I see, so you were actually brought up with some religion? \n\n             Yeah, then I followed Kabala briefly. I certainly do have a\n                judeo Christian religious background. I was actually influenced by my classmates\n                though, Kind of embarrassing story. But one of my friends at that time told me about\n                the communion, getting presents and all. Since I wasn\u2019t really brought up through\n                religion I decided to do it because I would get gifts. I think a lot of children are\n                like that. My family taught me spirituality not dogma. \n\n             What kind of spirituality? Can you explain? \n\n             Well, that is why today I would be somewhere in between deism\n                and agnosticism. Spirituality is a vague term to express the fact that you do\n                believe in more than just physical. You believe the interconnectivity of everything\n                in the universe from the atom to the universe. \n\n             Like Buddhism? \n\n             You believe that there may be a greater purpose. Well Buddhism\n                is somewhat similar except I have more of a judeo Christian root. \n\n             You just don\u2019t stop at naming any religion in particular as\n                yours? \n\n             Well, for instance the 10 commandments, whether written or not\n                by god are good values. They are moral standards applicable to any society whether\n                religious or not. \n\n             That\u2019s true. We shouldn\u2019t have to follow them just because we\n                are afraid of going to hell. \n\n             Let\u2019s just say that I don\u2019t believe I need religion as I mean\n                to feel connected to the rest. \n\n             I believe my connection to everything is solely individual and\n                based on my own experience. Everyone should have the choice of using whatever means\n                necessary to channel himself whether religion, philosophy and so on. Furthermore,\n                having a more of a global cultural identity has prompt me to travel a lot and\n                discover other cultures which in time strengthens the feeling of being part of\n                humanity as a whole. To understand that right and wrong can be a cultural, social or\n                religious view. In the end it all depends from which angle you perceive the subject\n                from. \n\n             Finding spirituality doesn\u2019t just come automatically, are there\n                any life-changing experiences in particular which have lead you to these beliefs? \n\n             I lost my father when I was thirteen, this brought unpleasant\n                turmoil to my family and changed my life radically. During my teenage years, I had\n                trouble identifying with a specific group because I felt so different. I had lost a\n                parent, I was multicultural, Had no religious ax yet wasn\u2019t atheist either which got\n                me really lost and confused. After finishing high school I needed to find my roots\n                and decided to go on a backpacking trip to China to find out more about my father's\n                past. Now China being so different from where I grew up made me understand that the\n                world isn\u2019t just one vision, but infinite visions of reality. In a sense, by\n                traveling there, not only I found out more about my father, discovered a place and\n                tried new thing. This trip kind of cleared my head and I realized that we were all\n                part of a whole as different as we are. From then on I decided to go backpacking\n                every summer. I then went to Chile, Bolivia, and Peru, where I spent most of my time\n                living with locals hence discovering fully culture and traditions. Went to Vietnam,\n                Eastern Europe. I\u2019m proud to say that I have friends of all nationalities, religion\n                and color. \n\n             Could you tell me about a specific moment or situation on one\n                of your trips that have left a mark on you? This can be a person you've met too. \n\n             During my trips, I was lucky enough to meet very interesting\n                people as well as encounter odd situations. We started drifting around and instead\n                of staying in Chile, went north to Bolivia. Now at that time the country was on the\n                brink of civil war. Most of the roads were closed and bus drivers would tell us that\n                driving during the night was unsafe and extremely dangerous. Yet we managed going on\n                and got to La Paz, the capital. Now originally we were making way to go to Peru,\n                while seeing a couple of amazing landscapes. But like I was saying the country was\n                in civil war. rRoads were obliterated but broken pavement, while angry mobs ruled\n                the city. The ever growing presence of military rendered the situation uneasy and\n                one could see burning cars, illuminated roads as giant iron candle sticks. Now being\n                a foreigner and going through such a stage in a countries history is extremely\n                enriching because these inequalities, however serious they can be in your country of\n                origin, are more strongly demonstrated in a poor country. One can finally grasp how\n                the world is filled with conflictuous passions. \n\n             Were you ever afraid? \n\n             I wouldnt say I was afraid because we didnt encounter any\n                potential life threatening situations with locals. The military were very suspicious\n                but most of the people we met told us we should leave immediatly because it is\n                unsafe. General population is usually always friendly. Occasionally you would bump\n                into people that disliked foreigners but thats always a minority. From there on we\n                headed to Peru, saw a couple of breathtaking if not life changing views. Let me\n                point out the fact, that humanity has built such jewel across the world that merely\n                seeing thus wonderful masterpieces enables to see what potential we have. Not only\n                that, but nature also has amazing treasures to share. Coming back to the original\n                story, after hanging out in Peru for a while we were bound to head back 2000km south\n                to eventually get back to our plane. The only problem was, we drifted so far away,\n                that we started having financial issues. Furthermore, we were in such remote areas\n                that no one could actually transfer us any money through western union or money\n                gram. We literally had just barely enough to pay for buses, so we started fasting\n                for 2days. Now fasting while being constantly on the move with a 15kg bag on ur back\n                and under scorching heat was harder than expected. During one of the bus rides,\n                which was a 15h bus ride by the way, I started feeling dehydrated and nauseous. I\n                started seeing stars and couldnt get up anymore. Actually my friend told me I turned\n                green, so I got myself together and started begging for water. In a bus filled with\n                peruvian farmers we were the only foreigners. One of them shared his orange juice\n                with me. This helped me greatly, but the experience of having literally nothing and\n                having to beg for water and supplies was truly a horrible yet strong experience to\n                bear. \n\n             Yeah, it must make you appreciative of what you have. \n\n             It also stirs up the instinct of survival. \n\n             Where else have you traveled? \n\n             I have travelled also to China, Vietnam, Mexico, Eastern\n                Europe. \n\n             What about people you met on your trips? \n\n             I have met very interesting people on my trips. The most\n                intriguing person I have met is during my Vietnam expedition in 2005. I was waiting\n                for a friend to join me from Thailand and had some time to kill. So I decided to\n                visit Ho Ghi Minh City (formerly Saigon) and its surroundings. Now in Vietnam there\n                are diverse religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and the latter Cao Daisme. Now\n                Cao Dai is a religion which holds 7 million worshipers throughout the world but the\n                actual root of it is in Vietnam. It is rather complicated to explain, but it more or\n                less a combination of Buddhism, Christianity and Humanism. The practice is mainly\n                inspired by Buddhism but the belief in a certain divine order, the all seeing eye\n                (judeo christian) with reincarnation. Their temples are usually extremely colorful,\n                with blue ceilings, very different from what we are used to seeing in the Western\n                World. I was visiting one of those temples, enjoying the new scenery and started\n                talking to one of the monks. After some platonic chit chat he asked me where I was\n                from, so I cut the story short and told him I was visiting from France. He then\n                asked me if I was interested to talk in french with one of the people there. I\n                naturally accepted and followed the monk behind the altar, towards the private\n                chambers. I met up with a very old man, probably in his 80s. It was hard to\n                understand him because the communist regime under Ho Chi Minh cut his tongue off.\n                Let me remind you that communist regime heavily repressed any religious ideas and\n                concepts. It turned out progressively that the man was more than merely a priest. He\n                was the equivalent of what we would call the Pope in the Catholic Church. He started\n                showing all these letters from political personalities such as Henry Kissinger,\n                Jacques Chirac the former president of France, The Queen of England, Australia's\n                prime minister. I was literally amazed encountering such a prestigious man. He was\n                so humble, so human, so far away from politics, very down to earth if I may say. Now\n                having this opportunity and to talk about spirituality with someone so highly\n                respected in that part of the world was truly an honor. He gave me some of his\n                written teachings which I brought back to Paris with me, not to practice my newly\n                discovered religion but to remember that moment in my life. \n\n             So tell me how you feel about being half American. \n\n             Nothing specific, I have always had a certain warmth towards\n                the US. I'm definetly not as patriotic as the average American and also may have\n                developed a more critical approach towards what America is. Living in New York is\n                great. Ive always wanted to spend some of my life in the US. You have to understand\n                that although I was raised in France there are certain things that were passed on to\n                me as American culture. For instance the fact of being able to celebrate Halloween\n                within the US was something I really enjoyed. I have always wanted to celebrate it\n                in the real surrounding. \n\n             Do people take you for an American or do they tell you that you\n                seem European? \n\n             I feel more european culturally speaking, however when I talk\n                with people and have random conversations, they wouldnt know that they would come to\n                realize it when for instance they would talk about American Football which I have\n                never watched, or when I would randomly mispronounce a word that I havent used that\n                much before. Im not considered by americans as french either. They dont really\n                comment on it; thing is I know how a word sounds I just sometimes mispronounce it\n                and then auto correct myself. People just consider me as a rare commodity, an\n                American raised in Europe. \n\n             So do you identify more with french or Americans? \n\n             I don\u2019t identify at all with French, because I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t\n                even have a French passport. \n\n             But you lived there your whole life. \n\n             Yes but those circumstances have given me a more European\n                feeling that a French feeling I am part of this generation of kids that have mixed\n                nationalities in Europe and consider themselves as Europeans. \n\n             But you could easily get a french passport. \n\n             Yes but I wouldn\u2019t want it. \n\n             Why\u2019s that? \n\n             I definitely come from France, am used to eating habits, but i\n                feel different than the average french. Mainly tax purposes, but also because I am\n                weary of France and wanted to leave for a while. \n\n             Why are you weary of France? \n\n             In my opinion France hasnt been evolving lately and its\n                stagnating views are leading it to its downfall. And because it isnt turned towards\n                international careers France is very Chauvinist, and being multicultural isnt seen\n                as a high asset like in the States. \n\n             Why do you think that is so? \n\n             Hard to say, but part of it is because France was once a great\n                country on an international level. Its greatness has been withering ever since and i\n                believe its people feel that way. \n\n        \n    \n", "mode": "spoken", "name": "interview_nathan_hole", "class": "face-to-face"}

all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.\n         We would go into the bakery and we would ask for-\n      \n      \n         \n            \n         \n      \n      \n         -a nickel worth of scraps!\n         \n         \n      \n      \n         And we didn't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie.\n         And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking, mistakes.\n         So they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us.\n         And that's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now.\n         I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre.\n         And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie.\n         I mean, my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back, but today you wouldn't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother; you just wouldn't do it.\n         And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that.\n         Which is kind of sad that you can't do that anymore and it's not just because things are, there're bad people in the world but it's too much traffic.\n         You have to check everything about a movie, check it out to see what the content is and just wasn't like that when I was growing up\n         .\n         Also about that same time period in my life, I guess again between seven and ten years old, which seems to be what I remember most vividly, my best friend uh, was Kathy Josey, and she was a next door neighbor also, and we remained friends up until, uh, she was about 35 and she passed away with cancer.\n         But we, we remained close friends.\n         In fact we shared an apartment, first apartment either one of us ever had.\n         And when we were, um, little girls we used to play \"Career Girls\"!\n         \n         We did!\n         And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen.\n         And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up, we sure did; we got an apartment.\n      \n      \n         Uh-huh.\n      \n      \n         Um, Kathy and I also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just, it seems like, I remember we both had like our mother's long skirts, or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers.\n         But we had, Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother's and I didn't have the necklace.\n         And it was really beautiful and I really, really wanted one.\n         So we only had the one necklace and we, er, we decided, I don't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice of whatever, but she said I could wear it part of the time.\n         And we would literally time the amount of time, we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever.\n         And the way we decided who got to wear it first, and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally, she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than I am.\n         So, it, that became\n         a normal thing with us.\n         Whenever we only had one of something she would always say, \"Well, I think the youngest one gets to do it, or wear it or whatever first.\"\n         And, that just always stuck in my mind, that in, in our adult life I brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she didn't know anything about that and I thought to myself, \"she does,\" and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one.\n         Um, also we did a lot of pretending and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups.\n         And my sister and I used to pretend also and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am, maybe two and a half, and we used to play Robin Hood except we didn't have a Maid Marion, we had a Saretha, I don't know where in the world that name came from.\n         But we would switch playing Robin Hood, one would play Robin Hood and one would play Saretha.\n         And Saretha was the counter, would be the same thing as Maid Marion, and, why, again, I don't know why we didn't use Maid Marion.\n         But in my mind I can remember playing that, like all day long.\n         And we would go over to my grandparents' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and, uh, banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch.\n         And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or, uh, it could be a castle; just do many things with it.\n         Um, and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge, I don't know, I guess it was an oak tree, but it was a really big tree, but it was a climbable tree.\n         And it had real large, thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches.\n         And that was another game that Jill and I used to play; we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant.\n         And in the yard, we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted, um, flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a, as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever.\n         When I was a teenager, an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark.\n         And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old; we were of driving age.\n         And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with and there were, golly, there might've been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends.\n         Everybody had their own \"best\" friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together.\n         Um, and we would, had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls, Betty Belle, her dad had a VW Beetle, and we'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle.\n      \n      \n         Did Betty Belle turn Catholic?\n      \n      \n         No, huh-uh.\n      \n      \n         She didn't?\n      \n      \n         No.\n         So we went out one night to the movie, but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to, and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen, and we didn't have chain pizza places like we do now, like Pizza Hut and all that.\n         This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go.\n         And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tips.\n         We would also drink water.\n         So it wasn't a good situation for the waitresses, but we had fun and we didn't even think about it.\n         We just did what we could get away with.\n         Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time.\n         So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in.\n         And I just remember seeing, and I was sitting in a middle section, I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me.\n         And I just remember that movie was, had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and it's nothing like these movies that are out today like Scream and, what is it?\n         Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is, where they're actual horror movies.\n         This was, uh, a real intense, um, drama and, just very scary; kept you on the edge of your seat.\n         And there was a scene in the movie I remember where every one of us, and it wasn't just our group, but so many people in the theatre, they screamed out at one time.\n         And that's really all I remember about that night, it was just a lot of fun.\n         And I really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that, that I can remember going out with good friends.\n      \n   \n", "mode": "spoken", "name": "NapierDianne", "class": "face-to-face"}

Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too.\n         So he graduated from, um, Johnson C. Smith, here in Charlotte.\n         I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there.\n         I, in later years, I went on to college some but I didn't complete the, uh, whole four years.\n         Um, I remember once, when I was working in a mill, and I was spinning yarn, and I was saying to myself, and, I was praying actually, and I said, \"God, one day I want to work in the school system.\n         If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy.\"\n         As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, \"Have you considered being a teacher assistant?\"\n         I said, \"I would love to.\"\n         So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont.\n         I'd never gone to college before.\n         I was really afraid.\n         But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.\n         After a while, the principal said, \"I would like for you to bring me your, um, transcript so I can see what your grades are like.\"\n         Luckily I had all A's.\n         I did very well.\n         And he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year.\n         Um, my dream, my prayers were answered.\n         I enjoy my job very much.\n         I can't think of any job that would make me any happier.\n         A few years later, um, I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education.\n         At first I didn't want to apply for it, but the principal called me during the summer months and said, \"Sandra the time is running out, you need to apply.\"\n         And he told me I would have to write this paper.\n         Well I didn't like writing at the time\n         but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.\n         And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper.\n         And I went ahead and mailed it in thinking uh I won't get the scholarship.\n         Who cares?\n         I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy.\n         But one day I came in and I looked at my mail and I was accepted.\n         \n         I couldn't believe it.\n         Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity, so I felt very proud of myself.\n         So I went on and took the courses, and as I started I think I was taking economics.\n         I think that was the last class I took.\n         My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.\n      \n      \n         But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued?\n      \n      \n         Yeah, and at the time, I was also working in the classroom.\n         I guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence.\n         And they hired a sub but the sub didn't do that much.\n         I had to take over the classroom.\n         So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting\n         to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband.\n         After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school.\n         I just got to a certain age and I said, \"No I can't do this anymore,\" so I never went back.\n         But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so.\n      \n      \n         How many different schools did you teach at?\n      \n      \n         I've only worked at two, two schools.\n         The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down.\n         So I was in those situations where I first, come first, transfer last, come first to transfer out.\n         So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.\n         I didn't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really, really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park.\n         But then, after awhile, I fell in love with Berryhill.\n         If I'm not mistaken I think I've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years, 17, 18 years I've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire.\n         \n      \n      \n         And why did the other school close down?\n      \n      \n         Um, the, you know, I really don't know.\n         Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years.\n         I really don't, I don't remember why that school was ever closed but it was.\n         And I enjoy what I do.\n         That's it.\n      \n      \n         All right thank you.\n      \n      \n         Thank you.\n      \n   \n", "mode": "spoken", "name": "ReidSandra", "class": "face-to-face"}

voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything\n \t\n \t\n \t\tuh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all\n \t\n \t\n \t\twhat i would love to see done to stop all of this\n \t\n \t\n \t\tuh-huh\n \t\n \t\n \t\twe've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything\n \t\tbut if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand\n \t\tso yeah i do i really feel that that's uh an invasion of my privacy\n \t\ti agree with you on that particular subject there\n \t\tlet me see\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthat's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences\n \t\ti put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\tpeddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their salesman salesman to come out\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum um-hum\n \t\tyeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations\n \t\tuh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization\n \t\tand i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago\n \t\tand um gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even what i would consider you know a family hour it's time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\n \t\tand uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me\n \t\n \t\n \t\tnow i agree with their right to um\n \t\tpursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them otherwise i don't want to know they exist\n \t\n \t\n \t\tright\n \t\tyeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either\n \t\tand and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work\n \t\tand i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations\n \t\tand wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own\n \t\n \t\n \t\tnow the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in\n \t\ti don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i don't have a storm door but i'm sure i could rig up something\n \t\tbut you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like they they see that word and it says uh go\n \t\tinstead of stop\n \t\toh goodness\n \t\n \t\n \t\twonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment\n \t\n \t\n \t\t\n \n \t\toh gosh\n \t\n \t\n \t\tbut i consider invasion of my privacy\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah yeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\ta harassment in itself\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah yeah yeah that's true that's true\n \t\thm well what else\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti believe we've pretty much summed everything up\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think\n \t\tyou talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else\n \t\tand i can't remember what it was\n \t\tand i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti'm drawing the blank\n \t\n

about it\n \t\n \t\n \t\thm\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthey don't do them real often which is obviously the death penalty\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs\n \t\tand sixty dollars sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let's just screwing up the system uh\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthat's pathetic\n \t\tthat's pathetic it's\n \t\n \t\n \t\tbecause they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or\n \t\tyou know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthis is true and and and and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyou know it's crazy\n \t\n \t\n \t\tlife in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit BSing with the system\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\twell even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for starving children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that\n \t\n \t\n \t\texactly\n \t\n \t\n \t\tso to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really\n \t\n \t\n \t\ta life for a life\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it's not just like one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthe old Charles Manson case i mean the guy is really\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um\n \t\n \t\n \t\t\n \n \t\tjust shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthe the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene\n \t\tuh when there's uh my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off\n \t\tuh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay\n \t\n \t\n \t\tright yeah i heard about that on the news yeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight\n \t\tthere's a percentage certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey\n \t\n \t\n \t\tright rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a fortune you know a fortune to keep doing that\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthe guy's guilty\n \t\texactly\n \t\n \t\n \t\tand the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution\n \t\n \t\n \t\texactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial which is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more\n \t\n \t\n \t\tright\n \t\tyeah yeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti think that that if it's if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah yeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\tuh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah yeah\n \t\twell if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really\n \t\tyou know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side\n \t\tand have some judge that was paid off or you know had good a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power\n \t\tyou know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but  seems like the jury system does have it's advantages\n \t\tbut i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know\n \t\tand i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people\n \t\n \t\n \t\thm\n \t\n \t\n \t\tit almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and that's it\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah yeah i get back to Price's comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyou know\n \t\t\n \n \t\the'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something yeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\texactly\n \t\tyeah yeah i mean you're you're in Dallas so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyou'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\toh they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthis is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah yeah\n \t\twell really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no i'm at home with two little kids preschoolers  my husband works for TI\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh so you're at the house you're not at the plant\n \t\toh

\t\twell as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day and uh\n \t\ti really don't know the answer um\n \t\n \t\n \t\t\n \n \t\n \t\n \t\ti would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type\n \t\tsporty one but um\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\tsomething that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh you do want a lot of that stuff\n \t\n \t\n \t\t\n \n \t\tyeah well yeah i like i like some of those things they come in really handy\n \t\n \t\n \t\twhat kind of uh\n \t\tthings are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the\n \t\twell what do you call them you said amenities\n \t\n \t\n \t\tamenities\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthat they have but what about um their reputation of the company or the price\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration\n \t\tbut\n \t\n \t\n \t\tit is for me other people don't seem to have the same problem\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\t\n \n \t\twell that's that's a big one in my book but uh um\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti have preferences for uh for some um makers over others\n \t\tum and i would sort of like to buy American\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\tbut you know i'm not so totally hung up on that that i wouldn't buy something else how about you\n \t\n \t\n \t\twell um the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um\n \t\tseveral things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh really\n \t\n \t\n \t\tbecause several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money um that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyou know we bought the car new and after  um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh\n \t\n \t\n \t\tand they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when\n \t\tbrake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\tyeah\n \t\tyeah i wouldn't have thought so either\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah so that was that was kind of a shock\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh\n \t\n \t\n \t\t\n \n \t\n \t\n \t\toh yeah i i guess there's a lot to to think about when you're trying to make that decision\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh\n \t\tum a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable\n \t\n \t\n \t\tright\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyou would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes\n \t\n \t\n \t\tno but then um\n \t\n \t\n \t\tespecially not after two years\n \t\n \t\n \t\tno but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune\n \t\n \t\n \t\treally oh i don't know\n \t\n \t\n \t\t\n \n \t\tyeah i've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh Mercedes and\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\teven though they do a lot of the work themselves then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive but for them it's it's sort of a hobby too to own them\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\twhat kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying or like what things are you looking at\n \t\n \t\n \t\twell i haven't really really gotten that far with it um i've always sort of liked General Motors a little bit better than some of the others but uh\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh i guess i really don't know\n \t\n \t\n \t\thow come  i've been kind of um\n \t\ti guess the commercials are getting to me the Toyota commercials and i know that a lot of people i've i've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\tyeah that i think that's\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti think they have a really good um quality\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum my uh daughter has owned two different ones and uh\n \t\tyou know we've had some work done on them but it's not too bad and the reason one of the reasons we um\n \t\tbought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\tand you knew it had had been through a whole lot\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\tand yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good so\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti thought they would\n \t\n \t\n \t\tthey seem to be really durable\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\tso i don't know i'm i'm not ready to buy a new car yet but i don't know if if the next time i'm going to try to\n \t\tto stay with buying something American or if i'm going to go for a little more\n \t\twhat i would consider to be a long-term investment\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\n \t\n \t\t\n \n \t\n \t\n \t\twell and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you\n \t\n \t\n \t\toh it's easy to get gas mileage in this car it gets excellent gas mileage\n \t\n \t\n \t\tyeah\n \t\tyeah that's one of the big throwing cards for\n \t\tsome of the foreign ones\n \t\n \t\n \t\tum-hum\n \t\n \t\n \t\twell\n \t\twe talked long enough\n \t\n \t\n \t\ti think so\n \t\n \t\n \t\tokay well enjoyed it bye-bye\n \t\n \t\n \t\t\n \n

However, when I started\nlooking through my archives, it occurred to me that my output this year defines\nme much more sharply than in years past. What do I mean? \nThe posts I consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to\nhave been composed in 2009.

(It\u2019s a truism, I know, but it has the benefit of actually\nbeing true.) In this case, the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel\nPagan hit an inside-the-park home run and initiate a triple play in the same game. John Emerson responded with some humbug about it\nnot being an inside-the-park grand slam, which made me remember that I had seen an inside-the-park grand slam at some time in the remote past.\nI remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play the Cardinals in an\nafternoon game at Shea Stadium, and thanks to the miracle of the Internet, I can definitively say that at approximately 4:30\np.m. on 9 June 1985 , I watched Terry Pendleton hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Joe\nSambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily. The fact that I can verify vague\nmemories of events that occurred twenty-five years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget\nthe Internet is capable of doing.\nThis realization is obviously not of world-historical importance, merely a reminder that this\nthing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to\nhuman memory. The fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an elevator\nwith on 28 December 2005 is less weird because I chose to write\nabout riding in an elevator with Grimace . That I can access detailed information about\nevents I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Sambito. Wow. I'd completely forgotten about him. I sometimes wish I could forget that\nPendelton is the Braves hitting coach. Closest I came to that was watching Dale Murphy get\ntagged out at the plate on what would have been an inside-the-park slam.\n Posted by: Chuck | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 06:16 PM \n\n\nHe pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets, stayed for '85, then he pitched for\nthe Red Sox against the Mets in '86 World Series. I remember him being ineffective, and as it\nturns out, he was . Now that I remember him, which I didn't before, I remember him as\nbeing the pitcher who'd pitched for 1) the team the Mets faced to get to the '86 Series and 2)\nthe one they faced in it. I didn't remember that I remember that, but now that I do, I do.\nMemory, as Gertrude Stein would say, is funny.\nPosted by: SEK | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 06:27 PM\n\n\nApparently the drug use, sexual excess, and weird UCI experiences haven't softened your\nbrain yet.\n\nWhat's really bothersome, though, is when you only remember things from your distant\npast. \n\nMy grandpa was alert till the end, but when I last saw him at age 92 everything he wanted to\ntalk about was 70 years in the past.\n\nPosted by: John Emerson | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 07:02 PM\n\n\nA guess, but perhaps your grandfather's life at 22 was more interesting than the ensuing 70\nyrs. \n\n Posted by: M. Bouffant | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 08:54 PM\n\n\nYou know what makes this post great? No stinking cricket.\n Posted by: tomemos | Wednesday, 19 May 2010 at 09:04 PM \n\n\n\nYeah, I remember Sambito from the Astros (when the Braves were in the old NL West because it\nmade sense to have a team 3,000 miles from most of their division rivals). Solid pitcher for a\nwhile. But burned out toward the end. Apparently, he is a player's representative now.\n Posted by: Chuck | Thursday, 20 May 2010 at 12:14 PM \n\n >Prosthetic memory. Posted by: Endy | Thursday, 20 May 2010 at\n02:35 PM \n\n\n\nI like to read about others watching baseball more than I like to watch baseball by a factor\nof nine. Having given up on watching the actual sport, mention of baseball now only sparks\nmemories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers. It is true that at the\nend of time, the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers, as they\nhad access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing, but horrendous to watch in\nperson. Plus, they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes. \n\nnota bene: An overdue library book is a crime against Humanities. \n Posted by: THE LIBRARY | Friday, 21 May 2010 at 11:17 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "Acephalous-Internet", "class": "blog"}

Bill McGinnis , Director - LoveAllPeople.org\n\n This website and everything on it is in the Public Domain, so you may use it freely, even\nwithout attribution. \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND , September 11, 2004\n Three years have now gone by since the September 11th attacks in 2001, and terrorism is a far\ngreater threat to us now than it was then. The number and severity of terrorist attacks\nworldwide has increased dramatically, as has the number of active terrorists. Before 9/11,\nterrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals, loosely linked by radical\nIslam and hatred of Israel and its sole supporter, the USA. Now, many more moderate Muslims have\nbecome radicalized, world-wide, willing to kill innocent civilians in order to achieve their\npurposes. And the serious targets have expanded to include civilians in Russia, India, Maylasia,\nthe Philippines, Spain, and elsewhere, as well as Israel and its sole supporter, the United\nStates. True, the USA has not suffered a successful major attack since 9/11, but this does\nnot mean that we are safer. The terrorists could strike any time they choose, through any of\nthe numerous loopholes so well reported in our media. But they have chosen not to attack,\nperhaps because they are waiting to produce an effect even greater than the 9/11 attacks, so\nthey do not appear to be losing strength. What could be more spectacular than the 9/11 attacks?\nNuclear! Or massive bio-chemical attack! And I think this is what they are waiting for. All of\nour frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing small-time casual attacks, but\nthey cannot stop a serious planned attack, any more than a mere door lock can stop a serious\nrobber who really wants to get into your house.  So the Bush administration can keep\nclaiming that we are safer now, under their policies. But this claim is merely feel-good\npropaganda, intended to keep the neo-cons in power. It cannot withstand clear-headed scrutiny.\nThe fact is, Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism, much less defeat\nit. By trying to \"stamp out\" terrorism by killing terrorists, Bush and Israel have made things\ninfinitely worse for us: more dangerous, not safer. And proof that Bush has failed may come at\nany moment, explosively, with one big successful attack here in the USA.  May God help\nus all. \nWHAT IS TERRORISM?\n TERRORISM is \"the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a\npopulation and thereby to bring about a particular political objective.\" Source: Britannica.com\nhttp://www.britannica.com/search?query=terrorism&ct=  We believe that any terrorist act\nis a crime against humanity and against the will of God, because it deliberately intends to\ninjure and kill innocent people. \n\nNEUTRALIZING TERRORISM\n Our purpose here is to NEUTRALIZE TERRORISM by removing the motivation for it. Without\nmotivation, terrorism will quickly die down, like a plant without water. \n We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force, because brute\nforce radicalizes the moderates, and they then join the terrorists. So you end up fighting the\nentire population. Brute force has failed in Palestine, and it is failing in Iraq. \n We try to be even-handed in opposing all terrorism, although we recognize that the greatest\nterrorist threat in the world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that Allah\napproves of their criminal behavior against Israel, The United States, Russia, India, the\nPhilippines, Australia, and others whom they falsely believe to be \"waging war against Allah.\"\nAnd the second-greatest terrorist threat comes from several countries, mainly Israel, who\nsometimes resort to terrorism themselves, claiming \"self-defense,\" as they desperately try to\nprevent further attacks by radical Muslims. In all of these cases above, if the radical Muslims\nwould cease their attacks, all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end. \n Beyond these two sources, there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world, with the\npossible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic\nepisodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups. \n\nThe moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and\nerroneous. They need to be identified and attacked. If the terrorist loses faith in the\nrighteousness of his acts, he is less likely to perform them. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1: \"Terrorists\nOffend Allah.\"\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2: \"Terrorist\nMurderers Insult Allah, Bring Shame To Islam\"\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3 (LATEST AND BEST!\n- Framed Below): \"Qur'an Forbids Terrorism\"\n\n\nIn every case of terrorism, we will find some kind of legitimate underlying\ngrievance. If we eliminate the legitimate grievances, we have eliminated much of the\nmotivation. \n Is this \"negotiating with terrorists\" or \"trying to appease the terrorists,\" as some\nIsraeli/NeoCons would try to say? No. It is simply recognizing the realities of human\nmotivation, right or wrong. To deny reality, as the Israeli/NeoCons do, is to invite disaster,\nas they have done. \n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nA big picture of our entire Anti-Terrorism strategy can be found at our website\n=> http://www.loveallpeople.org/defeatingterrorism.html . \n\n\n\n Blessings to you.

{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/blog/blog-jet-lag", "text": "\n   \n      \n         Jet Lag: Pathophysiology and Cures\n         The longest Monday of my life\n         \nI recently returned to the US from Australia. The 14-hour flight took me from Monday morning in Sydney to Monday\nmorning, again, in L.A. Crossing the date line messed up my sense of time enough without the added bonus of thinking I\nshould be heading to bed just as the sun began to climb into the California sky.\n\nYou may be familiar with the concept: Jet lag. The catch-all name for circadian misalignment, the disruption of sleep\ncycles and circadian rhythms. If you've had the pleasure of crossing time zones in a jet plane, whether it was a mere\nthree-hour hop from one coast of the US to the other or a trip to another continent, chances are, you've experienced\nsome amount of jet lag. \n\nThe pathophysiology of jet lag\n\nNormally, two systems--the homeostatic system and the circadian system--work together to produce a 24-hour sleep\ncycle. During the day, the homeostatic system slowly accumulates a 'sleep drive,' a desire to sleep that increases as a\nfunction of time spent awake. The circadian system generates an alerting signal in opposition to this sleep drive,\nwhich, during the day, keeps a person from feeling increasingly sleepy. An hour or two before bedtime, this signal\nsubsides, and s/he realizes it's time to hit the pillow. The sleep drive dissipates as a person sleeps and by morning\n(assuming a full night's rest and possibly some coffee), s/he will be feeling alert and ready to go again.\n\nRobert Sack wrote a delightful paper [PDF] on jet lag, by the way, which is\nwhere I'm getting much of my information. \n\nSo we've got a nice cycle of sleep. Jet lag is what happens when the homeostatic and circadian processes are\nmisaligned. For example, the circadian system may signal a person to be alert when it's not actually morning, or may be\nreduced during daytime hours, causing daytime sleepiness because the homeostatic sleep drive is no longer cancelled\nout. \n\nBut I don't want to be sleepy!\n\nHow do you beat jet lag? Robert Sack lists three primary approaches: \n\n\nReset the body clock\nPrescribed sleep scheduling\nMedication to counteract daytime sleepiness or insomnia\n\n\n\nLet's start with the first one, as it turns out to be the most complicated. \n\nResetting the body clock\n\nThe two most effective ways to reset the body clock are 1) through bright light exposure, and 2) timed melatonin\nadministration. \n\nLight is one of the most important cues about time of day and has the greatest effect on circadian timing (much\nsmaller effects are seen from regular activities and meals, for example). Studies have shown that without light cues,\ntotally blind people tend to have free-running circadian\nrhythms with an average period of 24.5 hours, instead of the usual 24. If a person is exposed to bright light early in\nthe day, the person's internal clock is reset to an earlier time; if exposure is instead in the evening, the internal\nclock is reset to a later time. Brighter light has more of an effect (such as the sun, at 3000 to 10,000 lux), though\nlower intensities (e.g., 100-550 lux) can produce changes.\n\nArtificial light sources can be used to supplement daylight, to help reset a person's internal clock to the correct\nnew time zone when traveling. Alternatively, a person could wear very dark glasses, as light avoidance could help\nminimize the problems of light exposure at the wrong time of day or night. \n\nResetting the body clock, Part 2: Melatonin\n\nMelatonin is a hormone that has been linked to the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles\n[PDF]. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland at night; secretion is suppressed by light exposure, and as such, the\nhormone can be thought of as a \"darkness signal.\" If doses of melatonin are administered in the morning, circadian\nrhythms will be shifted later; evening doses shift rhythms earlier. Timing of the doses is more important than amount\nper dose, though it remains to be seen what the optimal dose and optimal time of administration is--trials have been\ndone with doses from 0.5 to 10mg, at times ranging from three days before departure to five days after arrival in the\nnew time zone.\n\nIf doses of melatonin are combined with light exposure, the results are what you might expect: synergistic if both\nare administered to produce a time shift in the same direction (both earlier or both later); antagonistic otherwise.\n\nSleep, wake, sleep, wake\n\nThe second way to beat jet lag: Sleep at weird times. Slowly adjust your sleep schedule to match that of your\ndestination, or keep your home sleep schedule for a while after you arrive. The problem with this is that your\nsleep-wake schedule won't match up with that of the people around you, and if you need to be awake for breakfast at 7am\nor for a meeting in the afternoon, your sleep schedule may interfere. Use this method at your own risk. \n\nDrugs for everything\n\nLastly, we have sleep medicines. As you might guess, hypnotic medications combat insomnia and stimulants fight off\ndaytime sleepiness pretty well, because by definition, that's what they do. Both benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine\ndrugs have been shown to be effective in the first case; for the latter, the most common solution is to consume more coffee [PDF]. This works! In the study\nlinked, subjects were treated with slow-release caffeine or with melatonin prior to a long eastward flight; the caffeine\nsubjects were less sleepy than either melatonin or placebo. Granted, caffeine subjects also took longer to fall asleep\nlater and awoke more frequently, but that may be a risk you have to take.  \n\nLagging behind\n\nLight, melatonin, drugs, strange sleep schedules. Of course, the only solution that will always work is time. The\nhomeostatic and circadian processes need to realign, and while the aforementioned ways of beating jet lag can fast track\nthe process, it still takes time. \n\nUPDATE: ; I was alerted by a friend of the existence further research of which I was\nunaware: Another way to reset your sleep-wake cycle is to stop eating . If you fast for about 12 to 16 hours, your body clock will reset, with whatever time\nyou break your fast as morning. The  Fuller, Lu, & Saper paper\n[PDF], published in Science , discusses the mechanism, though a more recent paper argues that the Fuller et al. results are inconclusive .\n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "blog-jet-lag", "class": "blog"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/blog/blog-monastery", "text": "\n   \n      \n          Tibetan Buddhist Retreat\n\n         \nFaded squares of fabric, strung together in repeating blue-white-red-green-yellow chains, crisscross the branches of\nbare-limbed trees. The gentle wind makes them flutter. Orange-gold light filters into the grassy meadow, touching a row\nof canvas tents and the temple house beyond. Tsechen Kunchab Ling : Temple of All-Encompassing Great Compassion. This is the seat of His Holiness\nthe Sakya Trizin in the United States, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery established nine years ago.\n\nI spent the past weekend there. The field work office at my college arranges this retreat every semester. Everyone\nI've talked to who has previously attended says wonderful things about it; this semester, one of my friends told me she\nwas going: I should join her! I like learning new things, so I signed up. A good decision: I didn't return all chill and\nzen, as one friend told me his roommate had, but I certainly gained a few new ideas and approaches to mull over, and\ndipped my hand into a previously unfamiliar piece of the world.\n\nMedicine for one's mind\n\nThe first evening, the twenty-something students--most from my college, four from another--gathered in the shrine\nroom, sitting cross-legged on cushions as we listened to Khenpo Kalsang introduce Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. He began\nby telling us, \"Do not take any of what I say on faith. Take it through analysis, if there is some benefit in it for\nyou.\" Religion, he said, is like a drugstore full of medicine. You do not go to the drugstore and buy everything in\nit--you just buy what would be beneficial to you now. You believe the other medicine may have just as much value, but in\nother situations, not this one.\n\nWe discussed the foundations: the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma; the four noble truths; karma; defilements;\nthe six perfections. When we talked about the giving, and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient\nbeings (in the form of material items, kind words, protection, and so on), Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha,\nand how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat. \"So,\" a fellow student asked,\n\"Giving one's life for another being is the ultimate gift?\"\n\nKhenpo Kalsang, he smiled, and shook his head. \"Only if you feel no regret,\" he said. \"If you feel regret, it\ndestroys the merit.\" Until then, preserve your own life, and do not give away anything that would cause you regret. This\nstruck a chord. Self-preservation above all else, unless the right situation arises.\n\nKnowing and understanding\n\nLater, I talked to the resident nun, Ani Kunga, about psychology and cognitive science. She had studied psychology\nfor a while in grad school, but now holds the view that psychologists are going about understanding the mind and\nunderstanding the knower and what knowing is the wrong way. \"Psychologists,\" she said, \"study the brain and the self\nexternally. Ever since the 1920s, their science has been about observation of behavior, questionnaires, recordings of\nelectrical brain activity. But the mind can only be known by you, the person whose mind it is.\" She said\nphilosophy and epistemology were doing it right: looking at experiences from the inside.\n\nA big overlap exists between Tibetan Buddhism, psychology and cognitive science. All three examine the distinction\nbetween the self and others, between the observer and the observed, between knowing and the knower. I agree with Ani\nKunga to some extent--only so much can be known about the mind from external observation. But this doesn't mean that\nthere isn't merit to such studies, nor that nothing of use can be learned in that way.\n\nTibetan Buddhist philosophy also approaches the mind and the self from the inside. During a second philsophy session,\nKhenpo Kalsang translated a sutra about a king who received advice from the Buddha. This sutra delved into some\nquestions about the nature of the self, whether the self is a delusion, and how the clinging of self is a defilement. I\nintend to discuss it in more depth later, so stay tuned.\n\nCompassion training and prayer flags\n\nIn the afternoon, a group of us gathered outside for a meditation session with Ani Kunga. Sunshine melted lazily\nthrough the tree branches above, a breeze animating the branches' shadows so they danced between our cushions.\nCompassion and anger were the session's topics. The key message: \n\n\"If there's something you can do, why are you unhappy? Just do it. If there's nothing you can do, why are you\nunhappy?\"\n\nAni Kunga explained several off-session and one on-session technique for dealing with negative emotions (anger, hate,\nirritation, stress, jealousy, and so on). All the methods built off the idea that you are in control: anger is an\nemotion, and you can change your emotions. Stay tuned for a more in-depth post on the topic.\n\nAnother of the day's activities was making prayer flags. As Ani Kunga explained, \"Prayers, wishes, hopes,\naspirations--someone, many people, may share those with you. Hanging the prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone\nelse in the world. This may do no good at all, but it may--if everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires, perhaps\nit will do good. It may not. But if no one shares their prayers, it will certainly do no good.\nSo on the offchance that it will help, why not?\"\n\nNever done\n\nThis weekend reminded me that I'm not done learning.

And if I chose to make resolutions, I'd be far from alone--a\n2008 survey on Dorthy.com found that 66% of the 2000+ adults polled\nhad made resolutions at some point (though only 17% managed to keep them).\n\nMaking resolutions: It's about self-control\n\nThe question Anirban Mukhopadhyay of the Hong Kong University and Gita Venkatarmani Johar of the Graduate School of\nBusiness at Columbia University asked is this: What determines how many goals a person will set, and\nhow successful a person will be at achieving those goals? They performed a few studies in 2005 to look at the\nrelationship between self-control, goal setting, and goal achievement. They suggested that what you believe about self-control affects the\ngoals you set and achieve [PDF].\n\nIn the paper, \"self-control\" is used to mean a sense of willpower. Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani discuss various\nlay theories of self-control, noting that the amount of self-control a person has can be seen as either an inherently\nlimited or unlimited resource, and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed (the amount of\nself-control a person has can change over time, or not). An important premise to note here is the idea that the\nprobability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained. So if you\nthink you'll be able to achieve a goal, you're more likely to set it. Combine this with theories of self-control, and in\ngeneral, if you believe you have unlimited stores of self-control, you'll set a larger number of goals. If you believe\nself-control is malleable but limited, you'll set fewer goals.\n\nMukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani also discuss self-efficacy: belief in one's capabilities, the perceived ability to\ncarry out a desired action. They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the\nresult of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals\nthan people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply\ngive up.\n\nThe studies\n\nIn the first study, 85 participants (all college students) each read one of four passages presenting lay theories of\nself-control. Each passage contained two paragraphs; the first discussed self-control either as limited or as unlimited,\nand the second discussed self-control as either malleable or fixed. The participants then answered questions about their\nbelief in each of two theories presented, followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation, in which they listed\nall their current goals.\n\nThe study was testing whether a belief in unlimited, malleable self-control would result in most resolutions, and\nindeed, this is what was found. The experimenters had some concerns about participants' natural beliefs in relation to\nthe passages they read, however, so in study two, the order of the two measures (lay theories and motivation/goal\nlisting) was varied. Data from 130 new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if the motivation & goals\nquestionnaire were assessed first, then among the people who believed self-control is malleable, those who also believed\nself-control to be unlimited (vs. limited) set more goals. When lay theories were assessed first, this result reversed.\nThe people who believed that self-control is fixed were unaffected by order.\n\nThe third study moved on to examine goal achievement, adding a measure to look at self-efficacy. The study had two\nsessions, in November then February. In the first session , the 159 participants read passages about lay theories (much\nlike in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation), listed the resolutions they were planning\non making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out\nindividual difference measures (which included a self-efficacy scale). Only 86 participants successfully returned for\nthe second session, during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions.\n\nWhat does this mean for your resolutions?\n\nThe resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar (take a look at any list of\npopular New Year's resolutions, and you'll see the majority of the goals). As shown in the first two studies, more goals\nwere set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect\nmore success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself. Self-efficacy did not have\na significant effect on goal-setting.\n\nAs far as success goes, only the interaction between lay theory and self-efficacy was significant. If participants\nbelieved in limited self-control and were low in self-efficacy, they tended to give up more often, failing to achieve\ntheir goals. But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved\njust as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed.\n\nMukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay\ntheories of self-control and beliefs about one's own amount of self-control and self-efficacy, and propose this as an\narea for future study. But in general, lay theories about self-control can determine how much success you'll expect (and\nthus, how many goals you'll set), and self-efficacy beliefs can determine how much success you'll actually have.\n\nReferences\n         \nMukhopadhyay, A. & Johar, G.V.

This proposal has been in the works for nearly two years, and at long last,\nfolks are voting to approve it. Or to not approve it, but the former seems more likely.\n\nAs a member of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee and as a long-time varsity athlete, you might say I have\nparticular stake in the proposal. After all, I could get half a unit a semester for up to four semesters--a typical\nclass is worth one unit, and a typical physical education course of any level is worth half a unit, with a maximum of\ntwo physical education units counting toward graduation requirements. It seems justified: Students can receive credit\nfor participating in other extracurricular, faculty-supervised activities, such as the orchestra, the choir, and the\nrepertory dance theatre, so why not varsity athletics?\n\nMy friend over at Carolyn Blogs agrees: from the above standpoint, sure, it seems fair to give credit to\nstudents . If you get credit for introductory P.E. classes, you should get credit for varsity athletics. But our\nschool newspaper presents other arguments in favor, which Carolyn thinks are highly unjustified:\n\nOn top of everything, we must remember that varsity athletics present a considerable time commitment. It is rare to\nfind another activity on campus\u2014academic or extracurricular\u2014that includes a comparable daily rigor and frequent\novernight obligation. Varsity athletes regularly travel throughout the northeastern to participate in meets, games and\ntournaments, often gone from campus for an entire weekend at a time.  \n\nAnd you know what? Although it's certainly frustrating to travel to Boston for an all-day competition on the same\nweekend as a good friend's birthday party, a fascinating-sounding lecture, a dance party, and seventeen other campus\nevents no one in their right mind would ever want to miss, I agree with Carolyn. The reason I participate in my sport is\nbecause I enjoy it. If I cared more about other activities, I'd do those instead. Simply being a huge time commitment is\nnot a valid reason for awarding credit. Carolyn's supporting example, that higher level courses with more difficult and\nplentiful homework are worth the same amount of credit as introductory 100-level courses, drives this point home. And\nshe's backed up by our school's system of awarding units\ninstead of credit hours :\n\nThis system\u2014which in its most basic form allots one unit of credit per semester course, regardless of difficulty,\nhours in class and subject matter\u2014makes Vassar relatively unique in its credit system.\n\nAccording to Registrar Dan Giannini, \u201cThe rationale behind such a system is to try to send the message that all\ncourses are equal in worth and that one shouldn\u2019t try to distinguish between courses based on time spent in or out of\nclass.\u201d\n\nThe reason time commitment is highlighted is because, according to the authors of the article, the faculty \"must\nconsider what it can do to mitigate possible academic pressures on these students.\" Um. No, I don't think the faculty\nhas any obligation whatsoever. Students choose to be varsity athletes of their own accord. If they can't manage to\nbalance their athletics and their coursework, then perhaps they should reconsider participating in a varsity sport in\nthe first place. Athletes shouldn't get special privileges simply because they're athletes.\n\nPersonally, I like the fact that even though I dedicate huge chunks of time to my sport (more time than\nI dedicate to any single course, at least while in-season), I can still keep up with my classmates who are taking\ncomparable course loads, minus the sport. Sacrifices must be made, sure: Dance party on Friday night, or overnight\ntravel to a competition? \n\nThe question is, what's more important to me?\n\nYou learn stuff, too\n\nThe article continues:\n\n While athletes will continue to be held to the College\u2019s rigorous academic standards, the athletics credit could\ndiscourage a varsity athlete from unnecessarily taking on five academic credits while in their athletic season.\n\nWith the proposed varsity credit, the athlete seeking to assume five courses in his or her athletic season will be\nchecked with an overload form, thus encouraging the student to think twice about assuming such a large academic and\nextracurricular load.\n\nI'd like to be known that students who have trouble balancing tough course loads and time-consuming extracurriculars\nhave always had the option of taking a lighter load or dropping an extracurricular. Adding the option of a\nvarsity unit to the list doesn't make much of a difference. Students who aren't varsity athletes could add an easy P.E.\ncourse instead. Students who can balance their work and their sport will continue to do so. And let it be known, varsity\nathletes don't have to take a half unit for their sport... thus negating the need for an overload form if\ntaking five courses. \n\nCarolyn says, in response to the above quote, that \"participating in sports is optional, and should always take\nsecond place to academics.\" True, mostly. Academics are officially what college is about. Academics are what get graded.\nStudents' GPAs will, in part, determine what they are able to do with their lives. But academics are only one particular\nkind of knowledge. Carolyn's statement assumes that a student can learn more important things from academics than from\nparticipation on a sports team. Personally, though, some of the most important things I've learned about persistence,\ngoal-setting, success and excellence, effort, teamwork, leadership.... these I've learned from my sport and my coaches.\nIt's a different kind of knowledge than what one typically gains in an academic course, yes. But it's no less important.\nAnd that, I think, is the best reason for awarding credit for varsity athletics.\n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "blog-varsity-athletics", "class": "blog"}

The longtime center of American\nautomotive manufacturing was gutted when the Big Three car companies\nsimultaneously failed.\n\nDetroit, already plagued by corruption and crime, saw its unemployment rate\nskyrocket in 2009.\n\nWhat's left behind when an economy collapses? Cheap real estate, that's what.\n\nI'd read a New\nYork Times article about some forward-thinking artist-types who bought a house in Detroit for $1,900 . $1,900! Some of us\n(and lots of New Yorkers) pay that much in rent every month!\nIn fact, the article went on, soon a nearby house went on the market for $100.\nThe artist types notified their buddies, who moved in post haste.\nI was intrigued. Really? A $100 house? Even if it was a real\nfixer-upper, even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in\nit, that'd still be a hell of a deal. Why, out in New Mexico, where you can\nstill buy unincorporated land with no water or roads, you'd pay at least $1,000\nfor a house-sized plot of dust. So how can you buy an actual home for $100? That's literally cheaper than dirt.\n\nThe possibilities of this were fascinating. I had visions of hipsters from coast\nto coast converging in Detroit, building a new city on rock&roll. I pictured\nyoung artists owning homes, fixing up neighborhoods. I saw community gardens,\nart parks, a grassroots transformation of a city. We could take that oil-stained\nsoil and those rusted factories, and create something new and beautiful. With\nhouses going for $100, I thought,  what would you have to lose\nby moving to Detroit?\nAnd so Quiet Earp and I did some research, and came up with a list of houses\nselling for under a grand. We had plenty to choose from: there were more cheap\nhouses than we would have time to visit. We picked two neighborhoods to cruise,\nand dove in.\nBut once we entered Detroit, the truth hit fast: this is a modern American ghost\ntown. The place is practically deserted. Its streets, built wide to accommodate\nheavy traffic, are mostly empty. Houses and businesses are boarded up, painted\nup, bombed out and falling down. Even in the center of the business district,\nthere's no traffic and hardly any people.\nDon't believe me? I videotaped it:\n\nIt got worse as we drove into residential areas, looking for those cheap houses.\nIn fact, I've never felt so out of place in all my life .\nEven in Chicago's South Side, where we counted five white people in an hour, I\nfelt fine just driving around; not so in Detroit. Truthfully, it wasn't about\nrace: it was about being naive. It was about driving down streets where we truly\ndid not belong and were not welcome.\n\nDetroit is a ghost town, and it's inhabited by ghosts: the only people left here\nare those who can't or won't leave. They live in deserted neighborhoods, in\nhouses with collapsed front steps and missing windows. They sit on the porch and\nwatch the cars go by, watch the deals go down, watch their neighborhoods\ncrumble. And we, driving through slowly and reading house numbers in a\nlate-model Honda, stuck out like a couple of thumbs.\nSo we sped up, and went straight to the houses. Sometimes we stopped to take a\nphoto, but mostly we didn't. Earp and I have each lived happily in the wilds of\nWest Oakland, but the danger I felt in Detroit was like nothing I'd experienced\nbefore. I was actually afraid for my life.\n\nThe New York Times correspondent wrote that his friend Mitch's $1,900 home \"had\nalready been stripped of its appliances and wiring ... But for Mitch that only\nadded to its appeal, because he now had the opportunity to renovate it with\nsolar heating, solar electricity and low-cost, high-efficiency appliances.\"\nAs for the $100 house? It \"needed some work, a hole patched, some windows\nreplaced.\"\nWell, I don't know what part of Detroit these folks live in, but the $100 houses\nI saw looked more like this:\n\nYou see, abandoned houses in this town get set on fire. No exceptions. Wherever\nwe went in those neighborhoods, one in four houses had been torched. On one\ncorner, we saw a giant banner hung across a charred front porch. We didn't slow\ndown to take a photo, but I'll paraphrase: DON'T BURN\nHOUSES DOWN! DETROIT POLICE ARE WATCHING YOU!\nExcept that they obviously aren't. People who live in this part of town are on\ntheir own. And although I and many others would love to own even a fire-scarred,\ncondemned building, the fact is that we wouldn't last a week here. Buy a $100\nhouse in Detroit, and you get a lifetime supply of sleepless nights: you'll\nspend the next several years waiting for burglars and arsonists, murderers and\ncrackheads to break in the windows.\nIt's like the Wild West without the scenery, the gold, and the hope. It's the\nRust Belt.\n\nUltimately, I do believe that change will come to Detroit. There\nwill be a green movement here ; in fact it's already being cultivated by\nforward-thinking\ngroups and \nintrepid locals . One day, this place will be reborn.\nBut right now, the NYT's story reeks of Shinola.\nTruth is, any artist-type who moves into this part of Detroit is\nprobably pretty handy with a pistol or a shotgun . Anyone who takes this\nplunge is risking their life every day, betting on a future that may take a long\ntime to arrive.\n\n\nLong story short: Yes, you can buy a house in Detroit\nfor $100. And you will get what you pay for.\n\nCheers to Toby Barlow , who inspired my trek to Detroit, and who believes in a\nhappier, greener future. May your every dream come true, sir, and your book\nsell fabulously. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 Responses to \"Detroit and the Myth of the $100 House\"\n\n\nbisnis 16. Sep, 2009 at 9:46 pm \nGreat post. Thank you for this info. I need that\n\n\n Myself 19. Sep, 2009 at 10:06 am \n\nPlease track down and watch a movie called \"Detroit: A City to Yourself\", by\nNicole MacDonald. It's full of this imagery, and talks about the 1805 fire\nand rebuilding, and the post-industrial devastation that's ravaged the city\nsince.\nMost poignantly, it talks about Hurricane Katrina, which focused attention on\nrebuilding another city with this level of devastation, and how without a\nsingle catastrophic event to blame for it, Detroit's decay has gone\nunsympathetically ignored.\nThe movie wraps up by observing this, how abandoned buildings and spaces are\nbeing reclaimed by nature. About the pop fiction which explores the concept\nof a post-human world, and how it already exists now. And about how, if\nyou're a pheasant, that's not such a bad thing.\nHOWEVER ... \nThere's a lot more to Detroit than that. There are industrial spaces being\nturned into low-rent artist lofts and business incubators. (Look at the\nRussell Industrial Complex, for one example.) There are neighborhoods that\nrefuse to cave. (west of Livernois around McNichols). There's a whole bunch\nof nice stuff happening along the riverfront, from downtown up towards Stroh\nPlace.\nAnd there's always Belle Isle. When friends come to Detroit, I take them\nthere. It's our in-the-river park, 982 acres of green space, with a zoo, a\nbotanical garden and conservatory, rentable paddle boats, and tons of other\nneat stuff. Next time you're in Detroit, please head over. Oh, and entry is\nfree, so it's available to anyone regardless of economic status. You're\nliable to see families picnicking, bums gathering bottles and cans, geese\nforaging, and deer cautiously wandering the edge of the woods. Within a\nhundred yards of each other.\nSome of that cheap real estate isn't too horrible, either. There's a whole\nstreet being taken over by artists, Farnsworth between Moran and McDougall.\nSome of the things they've done down there are amazing, and the community\ngarden is a great bridge to the surrounding neighborhood. A few weeks ago,\nsomeone broke into their shed to steal their garden tools. Think about that\nfor a moment, hoes and shovels don't have enough pawn value to be worth\ncarrying out. Whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own\ngarden.\nYes, Detroit's got more than its share of bad spots, you're right. I've lived\nin the metro area my whole life, and there are areas (I can't call them\nneighborhoods) down there where I don't feel safe in daytime, much less at\nnight. But there are bright spots, and behind every one of them is a person,\nor a bunch of people, who refuse to give up.\n\n\n Jessica 19. Sep, 2009 at 10:30 am\n\nMyself -- Thanks for the comment and the great information. You are exactly\nthe kind of person who gives me back the hope I lost on my way into town.\nSeems there's a pretty solid group of Detroit residents who are truly\ncommitted to restoring the city, and that's beautiful to see.\nLove the fact that people are stealing garden implements (though it's still\nsad that they need to).\nI will absolutely watch A City To Yourself, thank you for the recommendation.\nAnd when I'm in the area again, I'll go out to Belle Isle and think\nlong&hard about the future of American cities--as I'm sure you do\noccasionally too.\n\n\n Reader Not Writer 20. Sep, 2009 at 10:17 pm\n\nWell, growing up not far from Detroit myself, I would point out a few\nthings:\n1. Driving a Honda in Detroit right now probably isn't really going to get\nyou welcomed with open arms. See, there's a wee bit of loyalty to the Big 3\nand driving a foreign car doesn't really scream \"solidarity\" to those\nstruggling to survive. Most of the funny looks you got were less about your\ncolor than about your ride. You think I'm kidding, but I couldn't be more\nserious -- that Honda is a visceral reminder for people of how the American\nconsumer has left Detroit in the dust.\n2. Detroit (proper) has been dying for a long time -- before the 1968 riots,\neven. Its going to take some pioneering individuals to start creating those\npockets of innovation, creativity, and vision. But its not going to happen\nwith the investment of $100 into a single house. Someone will need to begin\nby creating an urban \"oasis\" that mitigates some of the fears that you had\nwhile driving through the city -- where to buy groceries, a place where you\ncan feel safe on your own front porch, the freedom to sleep soundly without\nworrying about your copper wiring.\n3. For all that is wrong with Detroit -- and that's nearly everything --\nyou'd be astonished by the pride that Detroiters have for their city. They\nlack the means to build her back to her former glory, but she won't be\nabandoned. For all of those who are trapped there by their circumstances,\nthere are just as many who insist that they wouldn't live anywhere else.\n\n\n Raggedy Anarchy 21. Sep, 2009 at 7:21 pm \nThank you for the opportunity to see post-BushCo era Detroit through the\nprism of your vision.\nI've never been there, but ever since that mad, possessed American History\nProfessor I had, I've been haunted by Detroit. No, even before that -- \nThe Dollmaker  has often been called 'America's least pretentious\nmasterpiece'. (Joyce Carol Oates in the NYTBR)\nWhen folks like Gertie Nevels, and Levon Helm and John Hiatt and my favorite,\nJohn Henry, left the mountains to go wrestle with the Industrial leviathan\nin Detroit, they were in it to the death. Detroit won't be the death of the\ncourage of those early Detroit pioneers; it looks like Nature will prevail\nafter all. Everybody wins.\nI love what you are doing.\n\n\n Uncle B 18.

Thanks again, Sarah Palin! You successfully turned a\nRepublican seat to a, you know, \"Marxist\" seat. Good job. You're a genius.\n\n\n Filed under: Christine O'Donnell, Election 2010, Sarah Palin, Teabaggers, Wingnuts\n\nPosted By Bob Cesca | October 19, 2010 2:43 PM\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\nI heard this same accusation on Kos today, that the audience is laughing AT Christine\nO'Donnell on the first thing she says, but I disagree entirely: On THAT point, HER supporters\nare laughing at COONS, it's absolutely a \"She's got YOU, DUMBASS!!\" laugh, the sort of\n\"Oh-No-She-D'I'INT!\" laugh you'd hear from a studio audience when the slightly stupid but\naffable and hitherto ineffective Dunce Character finally gets a zinger in on the Handsome\nLead.\n\nRemember that at least half the audience in a venue like this would be there to support\nO'Donnell, and the \"Point to 'Separation of Church and State' in the Constitution\" dig\nis a virulently popular meme in the loonosphere from whence comes the Teabagger Political\nPlaybook. Those are hoots and calls of SUPPORT for O'Donnell supposedly putting one over on\nCoons, they aren't laughing at her. \n\nThere may very well have been a gasp, and some uncomfortable \"Okay, that's enough now\"\nchuckles at the end, but the guffaws at the top of the clip are WITH her, not AT her.\nPosted by: ELDING at October 19, 2010 2:52 PM\n\n\n\nHilarious.\nPosted by: adx at October 19, 2010 3:00 PM\n\n\nI don't think the audience is laughing at Coons; the laughter has an incredulous, oh-my-god\nsound to it. But it's obvious that O'Donnell thinks they're laughing at him, not her. When she\nhears the reaction, she looks out at the audience with a big, proud grin. She thinks she just\nscored mucho points on Baldy.\n\nElding is right; \"separation of church and state isn't in the Constitution\" is a major\nwingnut talking point. They routinely claim that the establishment of religion clause doesn't\nmean what everyone else thinks it means. So although this shows what an extremist nut\nO'Donnell is, it's not really a gaffe; it's standard stuff right out of their playbook.\nPosted by: Steve8489 at October 19, 2010 3:04 PM\n\n\nWell, if one is looking for the phrase, \"Separation of Church and State,\" yeah,\nthat's not in there, so TADA! Yay! Looks at me, I wins a big arguments and I poops my pants.\nBut the principle is in there. I love when ignorant fucks like O'Donnell and her little\norcling hordes make huge category mistakes like this. It's is akin to taking a tour of a\ncollege and starting it off at the administration offices and when that part of the tour is\nfinished, someone like O'Donnell says, \"Ok, that's great, but when are we gonna start seeing\nthe college?\"\n\nPosted by: at October 19, 2010 3:10 PM\n\n\n\nYes, it's standard stuff, and HER CROWD would have springboarded OFF of it, that's what I'm\nsaying: As far as she's concerned, it's not a gaffe, and as far as HER SUPPORTERS in the room\nare concerned, it was not only NOT a gaffe, it was a Direct Hit. They should have applauded,\nthat would have settled this matter for good. I'm convinced that's not laughing at her, that's\n\"Ooo, good one!\" FOR her. \nPosted by: ELDING at October 19, 2010 3:11 PM\n\n\nWell ELDING, its already being reported that it was HER that was clueless so Coons gets the\nlast laugh on that. \nPosted by: Allonfla at October 19, 2010 3:30 PM\n\n\nI don't believe this was a public event, Elvis, I think it was a debate before the students\nat the law school. I mean, it could be some of her supporters infiltrated, but I truly believe\nthere would've been lots of catcalling, etc. if that were the case.\nPosted by: pea at October 19, 2010 3:30 PM\n\n\nYeah, Pea, you have a point there, but still: The laughter doesn't sound incredulous to me,\nit sounds appreciative and snarky. Put yourself in a non-partisan Law School Student position:\nWould you laugh at loud at a Teabagger Meme like the one she dropped, or would you\nmutter/grumble to yourself, whispering to your colleague, \"What a fucking idiot!\" I don't see\na crowd like that laughing out loud at such a pitiful little meme, it's not even worth a\nlaugh-out-loud guffaw. \nPosted by: ELDING at October 19, 2010 3:53 PM\n\n\nwell, keep in mind that all of them probably know what a freak she is. I think it might be\nmore of a \"holy crap, I can't believe she just topped all the other stupid shit she's said,\nand I got to bear witness to it!\" laughter. I know if I had the opportunity to attend a Sarah\nPalin rally, I'd be overjoyed to hear some incredible stupid falling out of her mouth.\nPosted by: pea at October 19, 2010 4:07 PM\n\n\nwhich would be, uh, ANY Sarah Palin rally. Also.\nPosted by: pea at October 19, 2010 4:08 PM\n\n\n\nELDING......\n\nthe debate was at a LAW SCHOOL.

Yeah, they were laughing at her, as is appropriate.\n\nPosted by: Irish Girl at October 19, 2010 5:53 PM\n\n\nIt's beyond frustrating to me, as someone who has studied Constitutional Law, who competed on\nthe the national level on it in law school, and who published an article on it, to hear people\nwho clearly haven't done the first of these talk about it as if they know better than I do what\nthe Constitution says, means, and is all about. \n\nI had a TPer over at HuffPo tell me I didn't know what I was talking about vis-\u00e0-vis the need\nfor Constitutional interpretation and Constitutional Law (he believed that any and all\nConstitutional questions must and can only be resolved by Amendment , not\nby judicial review), before proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and\n\"despise[d] the legal profession.\" \n\nWhere do you go from there?\nPosted by: GrafZeppelin127 at October 19, 2010 6:41 PM\n\n\nI thinks this illustrates their biblical view of the Constitution, and by that I mean they\nregard it the same way as they regard the Holy Bible. It's a document that is not to be\nquestioned, but merely followed to the letter because it was handed down to us by greater\nbeings. Oh, and like the Holy Bible, that we mere mortals are not supposed to question or\ninterpret, they'll let us know what it really means and that will often conflict with\nwhat it actually says.\n\nThey try to exert some sort of control over it's meaning by elevating it to a level that\nmakes it untouchable. To them it's not a living document that was designed to change with the\nnation, but essentially carved in stone like the Ten Commandments. Immutable and unchanging.\nExcept for, you know, maybe an amendment barring gay marriage. But in order to regain some\ncontrol over their lives that they firmly believe they've lost, they're now trying to\ndetermine, with unwavering certainty, that we've all been doing this wrong the whole time and\nif we just get back to what the founders wanted, everything will be ok.\n\nGive 'em a few minutes, though. They're waiting on an email reply from the Washington\nre-enacter at Arlington to hand down some decisions.\nPosted by: Nanotyrannus at October 19, 2010 7:19 PM\n\n\n@GrafZeppellin127\n\nIn answer to your question -- where do you go from there? I've recently come to the\nconclusion that the answer is \"nowhere\". I used to be against making blanket statements about\nthe hard core tea partiers, like the person you described...\"they're not all crazy\" \"they're\nnot all hateful\" but lately, i'm over it. \n\n they don't believe in: evolution, climate change, the dept of education, public education,\ntaxes in order to pay for roads/police and firemen. they believe the President is not an\nAmerican. they see no problem with racism, sexism and fascism. they don't understand that\n\"freedom of speech\" doesn't mean freedom from consequences. they confuse losing an election\nwith tyranny. they horde food because glenn beck told them so -- they conflate their \"movement\"\nwith the civil rights movement --they \"detain\" reporters, on public property, for the crime of\nasking questions...\n\nyou don't reason with people who believe these things, any more than you'd try to reason with\ncharles manson. they're crazy -- plain and simple and it's really, really sad.\nPosted by: mslarry1973 at October 19, 2010 7:23 PM\n\n\n@ ELDING - Have to disagree, buddy. The debate was at Widener Law School. They laughed at her\nthe second time as well when she incredulously asked, as if not believing Coons, \"That's in the\nFirst Amendment?\"\n\nI don't think they were laughing at him. If they were, they'd be reacting after his comment\n(and probably booing and calling him a liar) rather than reacting after her comment.\nPosted by: Broadway Carl at October 19, 2010 7:23 PM\n\n\n@Irish Girl.....so good to see you!! I hope you're well. :)\nPosted by: Nicole473 at October 19, 2010 7:59 PM\n\n\nGrafZeppelin:\n\nI had a TPer over at HuffPo tell me I didn't know what I was talking about vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe need for Constitutional interpretation and Constitutional Law (he believed that any and all\nConstitutional questions must and can only be resolved by Amendment, not by judicial review),\nbefore proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and \"despise[d] the legal\nprofession.\" \n\nThere is nowhere to go with these ignoramuses. They would not believe you if you parted the\nsea for them first. I learned my lesson at HP. While it can be personally satisfying to present\nall your little ducks in a row, they will never stop erroneously knocking the damn ducks out of\nline. \nPosted by: Nicole473 at October 19, 2010 8:02 PM\n\n\nYou know she had better watch out! The separation between church and state is what saves us\nfrom SHARIA LAW! I think those trying to diminish the separation are probably secret Muslim\nsympathizers that are sneaking SHARIA LAW in on us!\nPosted by: Ron Spridgen at October 19, 2010 8:17 PM\n\n\nNah, I'm convinced that the audible gasps and stifled chuckles were from her attempt to bluff\nher way through an exchange regarding the Constitution in a room full of lawyers. \n\nPerformance art, people.\n\nShe's not running to win, and if you think she is, you're not paying attention.\nPosted by: Lexaburn at October 19, 2010 10:58 PM\n\nThink of those Bill Maher clips. The constant television appearances for the last decade or\nso. Think of who endorsed her, and how O'Donnell could teach her a thing or two\nabout...moderate ad-libbing.\n\nThe strategy is this: be as foolish as possible, so no one anticipates you actually knowing\nanything. Embrace the derision and/or ridicule. Go on the circuit as a passionate advocate for\nwhatever cause you choose to co-opt. In O'Donnell's case it's the same pseudo-Christianity\nholy rollers dignify to play within the political arena. In Palin's case, it's the\ncrypto-fascism that oozes within the GOP. The Teapublicans fool no one with their talk of\nindependence and the theatrical in-fighting. They always tame those they let in their ranks or\nthey destroy them. Palin knows her place, as do they all.\n\nDo you really think a serious candidate would go around asking for hints during a debate?\nSeriously! O'Donnell is not that stupid. I know some of you want to think she is for the sake\nof mirth and merriment, but she ain't. Sorry. Just like Palin isn't stupid enough to confuse\nPA with WV. Poke fun all you want, but at least be realistic with yourselves: you have just as\nmuch fun as they're having. \n\nTrust me, y'all, they are faking it!\n\nO'Donnell's running on personality alone, nothing more, nothing less. Regarding politics,\nshe's a glorified booster, same as with Mangle in Nevada. Lowden the chicken-lady and Mangle\nwere merely supposed to challenge and beat Reid, then get out of the way. O'Donnell is to be a\nface for the underdog teabaggers. This is why they're not making a full investment in her. Her\nplace is not in the senate, but on television.\nPosted by: Lexaburn at October 19, 2010 11:17 PM\n\n\nElvis, having watching the video several times, I have to disagree. The audience was clearly\nlaughing at her and her ignorance. However, she clearly thinks she that she has scored a huge\nwin and that the audience was on her side.\n\nJust more of her complete separation from reality.\nPosted by: DC at October 19, 2010 11:23 PM\n\n\nOh, and ELDING, their reaction stems from the fact that she broached the subject again after\nthe moderator moved on. Her question was the equivalent of asking \"Where're the pictures?\"\nwhen staring at the document, especially in that setting.\n\nShe did it on purpose, not to further the discussion, but to establish that, yes, she is a\ndependable dumbass.\n\nI'm telling you all, she's running a game.\nPosted by: Lexaburn at October 19, 2010 11:24 PM\n\n\nLexaburn, I have to disagree with your assessment that this is all a game and that she's not\nthat dumb. I don't believe she's as dumb as she is ignorant. It if really is a game for\nO'Donnell, then what's the end game? She may have flown under the radar for her previous\ncampaigns, but now she's made herself a fool in the national spotlight and effectively ruined\nany chance of continuing her charade, if her intention was to be a lifelong nominee in the\nfirst place.\n\nBeing a perpetual campaigner can only get you so far, and if they don't intend to win after\ngetting the nomination, then that con game is limited.\n\nMaybe Palin fits more into the realm of your assessment, but if she runs and loses in 2012,\nher shelf life is limited too.\n\nPosted by: Broadway Carl at October 20, 2010 12:29 AM\n@Nicole, hi! It's good to be back. I've been awol due to having a baby....little Liam was\nborn on 9/21 (a couple of weeks early but he's doing well). Thank goodness for FMLA and\nmaternity leave. \nPosted by: Irish Girl at October 20, 2010 1:08 AM\n\nBC, you misunderstand me. I'm not saying she knows a damned thing about the Constitution. In\nfact, I'd go a far as to say she doesn't give one damn about it. What I'm saying is that going\ninto these discussions, she's fully aware of her deficiencies. To tell the truth, I can't tell\nyou her actual \"endgame,\" per se, but if I had a guess it would be an extended stint on a\ncable news channel.\n\nThe \"shelf life\" of both women is only limited to the fraction with which they uphold a\nstandard. Palin took standards out of the equation when she quit her job. Were she to actually\nrun, it would be for vanity's sake. She's reaching for what O'Donnell has already achieved.\nThey've both lowered themselves to being cheerleaders for so-called \"conservative\" causes.\nWell, Palin did anyway.\n\nI attribute part of my assessment of O'Donnell to info I've gleaned from a good friend of\nmine that knew her on the media circuit at the start of the decade. My friend describes her as\na \"bad actress\" primarily, that co-opts \"conservativism,\" but doesn't necessarily cling to it\nas some may believe. This friend tells me that Christine doesn't believe half provocative\nand/or boneheaded things she's saying. O'Donnell is described as a normal conservative\nRepublican woman by my friend. I am convinced personally that O'Donnell's just a starved media\npersonality that found a new gimmick in running for public office. That is the lifestyle\nchoice she has made, and she's sticking with it. Some of the innuendo surrounding her leads me\nto this conclusion, as well. However, I can't be too conclusive...\n\nYou know what, I'm being too much of a stuffy doctor.\n\nAnyway, that smile she gives after asking about the 1st Amendment may very well be her being\nin on the joke she's making of herself. It's not the fact that she tried and failed to dictate\ncontent within a Constitutional Amendment; it's the fact that she knew she did not know and\nsaid what she said regardless. Do not try to make sense out of anything of this if you're not\nthinking like a...celebrity of whatever quality, let's say.\n\nHere's what you do: gather all the O'Donnell appearances that you can from online sources.\nGo through all, and see if her point of view EVER evolves beyond the con-servative blather or\nthe crank conspiracy theories. Next, ask yourself why she continues to be invited to these\npublic forums. What exactly is she adding to these conversations? In all my cable news\nwatching, I've seen far more dim characters than O'Donnell with regular gigs, so it's not the\nfact that she's dumb that gets her on television. My friend tells me of certain connections\nindividuals like O'Donnell have that gets them the leeway they need to raise their public\nprofile. Since they really have no one to answer to, they can go on television and say\nanything, get away with it, and do it again in yet another televised venue. It's a perpetual\ncycle. She's not campaigning to win anything, I'm telling you, BC. \n\nYou see how Rove immediately rejected her. I don't believe that was because she beat the\n\"establishment\" candidate. In fact, my theory is that Rove wasn't so much as rejecting her, as\nlimiting her role within the media environment. I'm thinking she's aiming to be on FNC on a\nregular basis. This all comes from my observing her debate performances, as well as her more\nrecent TV appearances. She's not so much running for office, as she is auditioning to be a\nregular voice for the Cons. A reaffirmation of sorts. She's been at this for a while, and they\nhave younger, more loopier and dim-witted Con tarts traipsing about. Palin's taking time away\nfrom them, but she has her own plans, which have yet to be revealed (though they may be all\ntoo obvious).\nPosted by: Lexaburn at October 20, 2010 3:42 AM\nChristine O'Donnell is certainly ignorant in the sense that, while perfectly aware that\nthere are many things she doesn't know, she is clueless as to how that might be an\nimpediment. It's an odd combination - knowing you don't really have a solid grasp on a\nsubject, but still being convinced that one's core principals are enough to overcome any\nobstacle.\n\nO'Donnell believes in the bible. She's a Jesus freak. And that's enough for her.\n\nO'Donnell is opposed to anything liberal, anything progressive, anything Obama, anything\nDemocrat, anything that can in any way be determined NOT to accord with the demands of her\nsavior and lord jesus christ (as SHE interprets his word) in any way. And that's enough\nfor her. The only reason she's a Republican / Tea Party gangster is because her brand of\ntheocracy and batshit stupidity would simply never fly anywhere else. In the stumped,\nfrustrated, hypocritcal idiocy of the extreme right - in that gang of redneck ignoramuses who\nwant simple answers to complex questions they do not understand - she finds the only market\nfor her brand of incompetent yammering.\n\nFacts don't matter. Evidence doesn't matter. History doesn't matter. Just look at the clips\nBill Maher runs of her blithering, insistent certainty. She pisses off EVERYONE, all the time,\nand never once = not a single time ever - stops long enough to even CONSIDER that maybe she's\nthe one who doesn't get it. It's THEY who don't get it. The constitutional lawyers don't\nknow fuck all about the constitution. She does because she took a week long course at Oxford\nUniversity! That she lies about her academic credentials, inflates beyond all reason and truth\nthe actual degree of study she has accomplished, does not in any way diminish her insistence\nthat she IS highly educated - really VERY knowledgeable about all of these things she doesn't\nknow about.\n\nRichard Dawkins doesn't know anything about the \"Theory\" of evolution...he's just a cranky\natheist! She read a pamphlet from the Discovery Institute that totally explains the difference\nbetween Creationism and Intelligent Design...which are not the same things, not at all, and\nanyone who says they are is just wrong. Especially that court in Dover that found, as a matter\nof FACT, that the ID crowd simply used \"Find & Replace\" to substitute \"Intelligent Design\"\nfor \"Creation\" (resulting in numerous instances of \"Intelligent Designism\"). But fuck it.\nEveryone is wrong, Christine O'Donnell is right. And if you disagree with her, then you are\nproperly an object of scorn and derision for being so poorly informed about things.\n\nIt may not be campaigning to WIN. She may well know that she's unelectable. But in her mind\nthat's because the voters have been brainwashed by the same evil, wrong-headed liberal /\nprogressive indoctrination that has corrupted our schools, our leaders and our society.\n\nChristine O'Donnell doesn't have a hidden agenda. She sees herself as morally correct,\nprofoundly right (in both senses of the term), and struggling as only a jebus loving martyr\ncan against the tide of evil sweeping her nation. \n\nAs for why she consistently gets to appear on television: She's fuckable, in that weird\nSarah Palin way that makes me recoil in horror and wonder what the fuck is wrong with anyone\nwho would touch those women with their worst enemy's cock.  She'll say apeshit nuts\nthings about masturbation, and flirting with witchcraft, and insist that these things that SHE\nknows - things no one else knows (like the top secret information about China's plans to take\nover the USA to which only SHE is privy!) places her in the unique position to lecture Obama\non Con Law, Henry Kissinger on foreign policy history, Richard Dawkins on evolution, Lawrence\nKrause on cosmology and Murray Gell-Mann on particle physics.

Pushed as an\neffort to promote \"Sonoma County\" wines and a consumer education effort, the new\nlaw instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines\ntheir own marketing efforts. Yet, the law does nothing to educate consumers.\nPassed unanimously out of the California Assembly and Senate, AB 1798 now awaits\nthe Governor's signature, which it will surely obtain. According to Noreen\nEvans, an Assembly sponsor of the bill, this new conjunctive labeling law\n\"requires that any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located\nentirely within Sonoma County - \u2013 like Russian River Valley or Dry Creek Valley\n- must also include the word \"Sonoma County\" on the label, starting in 2014.\nThere are 13 AVAs in Sonoma County.\"\nThe problem, of course, is that by placing the words \"Sonoma\nCounty\" on a bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in \"Russian River\nValley\", \"Dry Creek Valley\", \"Sonoma Valley\" or any other AVA in\nSonoma County,\nconsumers learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle. There no\nevidence that grapes grown in \"Sonoma County\" have any single distinguishing feature derived from the\nfact that they were grown inside the borders of Sonoma County. \nAssemblywoman Evans concludes, \"By improving consumer education on each bottle,\nconjunctive labeling will unleash the full potential of our delicious wines to\nrepresent Sonoma around the world.\"\nShe's correct. Beginning in 2014, \"Sonoma County\" will receive a tremendous boost\nin recognition due to the conjunctive labeling law that forces vintners to add\nmore wording to their labels\u2014whether they think the words \"Sonoma County\" help\nor hurt their marketing efforts.\nFrankly, if I was making high end wine from the \"Sonoma Valley\", \"Sonoma\nMountain\" or \"Sonoma Coast\" AVAs that depended in part on the quality\nrecognition that comes wtih these AVAs, I'd be pissed that I'm forced now to put\na place-name on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the\nwine behind my label and, in some cases, demonstrably lowered its perceived\nquality.\nHonore Comfort, Executive Director of the Sonoma County Vintners Association and\nan outstanding representative for Sonoma County wines noted this: \". \"This\nmoment ...marks the beginning of a stronger Sonoma County brand for generations\nto come.\"\nProponents of the new Sonoma County Conjunctive labeling law like to point to a\nsimilar law that demands \"Napa Valley\" be placed on all wines that are made from\ngrapes grown in that appellation, rather than simply using a sub appellation.\nThey point to the prestige that the \"Napa Valley\" designation carries. But this\nprestige has nothing to due with the law that demands \"Napa Valley\", in addition\nto simply \"Rutherford\", be placed on these wines. It has to do entirely with the\npromotional effort that has gone into making \"Napa Valley\" a place associated\nwith great wines.\nSuch an association will not be made with \"Sonoma County\"\nwines...ever. The vintners in Sonoma County simply can't make a case for\n\"Sonoma County\" having any meaning or for a region as vast as \"Sonoma\nCounty\" delivering any degree of quality to the grapes.\nWhy is it important for someone making \"Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir\" or \"Sonoma\nValley Zinfandel\" to help promote \"Sonoma County\", a designation that has no\nability to define the quality or character of the wines in my Sonoma Coast Pinot\nNoir or my Sonoma Valley Zinfandel?\nThis is an example of a County usurping the private label real estate, and it's\nvery valuable real estate, for the sake of promoting something that is of little\nuse to private commercial interests. Ask yourself...If putting the words \"Sonoma\nCounty\" on one's wines was such a great thing, why don't more vintners who make\n\"Dry Creek Valley\", \"Russian River Valley\", \"Alexander Valley\" or \"Sonoma\nValley\" wines already put these words on their label? They legally could...if\nthey wanted to.\n\nThe new Sonoma County conjunctive labeling law is the equivalent\nof the State of California and the County of Sonoma claiming imminent domain\nover the labels of hundreds of vintners.\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n Nick Perdiew said... I love it Tom. You found a way to tie this in nicely.\nThis is a case of over-reaching government regulation, costing business\nunnecessarily and burdening them with more regulations. It's just\nunnecessary.\n It also is a 'social promotion' in the sense that great Sonoma wines that\nnow are forced to use \"Sonoma County\" will be giving some of their\ncredibility to their lesser neighbors. Shades of wealth redistribution as\nwell. :-) Ew, ew, ew. \n August 30, 2010 at 11:44 AM \n\n\nJames McCann said... How many hundreds or thousands of labels will have to be\nre-submitted to the TTB between now and 2014? \n August 30, 2010 at 11:59 AM \n\n\nJohn Kelly said... \"...I'd be pissed that I'm forced now to put a place-name\non my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the wine behind\nmy label and, in some cases, demonstrably lowered its perceived quality.\" \n Exactly, Tom. And I am really pissed. And so is every other producer I have\ndiscussed this issue with. I still don't know whose interests are being\nserved by this useless piece of crap legislation. I completely agree with\nyou when you state: \"Such an association will not be made with 'Sonoma\nCounty' wines...ever.\" Duh. \n I've got real skin in this game. We are going to have to totally redesign\nour front label to make room for \"Sonoma County\" - and so far every mock-up\nis cluttered and decreases the impact of our brand. \n Our best option looks like we will go to \"North Coast\" or \"California\" for\nour front label appellation, and discuss the grape source, vineyard name and\nmeaningful AVA on the back label. \n Who is going to compensate me for this? I estimate the value to be in six\nfigures, and we are a small winery. For a larger winery with a\nbetter-established brand the value is much higher. \n Eminent domain is exactly right - this is nothing less than governmental\n\"taking.\" The legislators who backed this should be ashamed. They should\nalso expect to lose my vote for them next election. \n August 30, 2010 at 12:04 PM \n\n\nHardy Wallace said... Thanks Tom-- This law is such BS. \n August 30, 2010 at 12:20 PM \n\n\nJohnLopresti said... I put in 1+ decades in trade coursework, and several\nbranches of the industry. I support the new labeling requirement. \n Sonoma county always was the sheep ranch joke in the era of Napa's\nwell-deserved, early, global fame. Sonoma county now is as good or better\nthan those early Napa vintages. Together we have led the world into modern\nviticulture, with the help of UC Davis, and in some pretty good company from\nother regions. \n I suppose the new law is all Sacramento hype. But I think it will improve\nnorthcoast revenue and dignity. I admit I have voted for the bill's\nauthoress. \n When I was a kid in a county called Solano (not too famous for wines or\nAVAs) people sometimes would happen by our place asking where rte 37 was,\nwhere was Black Pt.; people always were confused how the somewhat\nneighboring counties had such similar names. Now after several decades in\nSonoma county I have learned to appreciate its uniqueness, for its\nviticulture and other industries. \n The town of Sonoma is on a typical route people follow driving from Solano\nCounty to Sonoma County. The ambience in the town Sonoma is only an enclave;\nit is rightfully proud of its heritage as a village, and for its\nviticultural traditions. But Sonoma county encompasses much more territory,\nand other AVAs within the county are starkly different from the\ncharacteristics of Sonoma valley and the town of Sonoma. \n Aint many people still overseeing vineyard blends. Vive la nouveau Sonoma\nCounty. \n August 30, 2010 at 01:24 PM \n\n\nNick Perdiew said in \n to JohnLopresti... John, Good of you to comment and good to have dissent.\nWhat do you make of the fact that vintners *already* are free to put Sonoma\nCounty on any label they want? Govt. cannot mandate marketing effectiveness\nanymore than it can mandate perception of quality. If it were effective,\nwouldn't you already see it virtually everywhere? I admit, I don't see the\nreasoning of your argument here. The issue of the costs to vintners is\nnon-trivial too as you can see above. \n August 30, 2010 at 02:04 PM \n\n\nBill Cadman said... Tom-- I wonder what the response would be in Napa and\nSonoma if the vintners in Fresno convinced the state government to require\n\"California\" be put on all labels of wine made within California? \n August 31, 2010 at 10:40 AM \n\n\nJohnLopresti said... These past few years, 'eminent domain' has become a\nlibertarian property rights flashpoint, since the Kelo v New London, CT,\ncase concerning urban renewal polemics. I can see Tom W's concerns, too. \n There was a counterpoint in the label world after some court cases resulted\nin a company's revising its grape sourcing to comply with tightened\nrequirements for 75% in-county fruit in order to remain legal in designating\nthe wine as from \"Napa\". One rambling article's author counted 16\noccurrences of the word Napa on the newly designed label of a famous budget\nwine producer's 2005 Napa cabernet sauvignon. \n August 31, 2010 at 02:04 PM \n\n\nJohnLopresti said...

Then, at Steve's site there is an interesting discussion of his\ncurrent ongoing efforts with blends from Carneros and Sonoma Coast. It's\neasy to get lost in nomenclatures, when one is striving for new concepts. \n In a way, all this tries to approach terroir from a slight distance; plus\nthe historical distinctions between the two premium distinctive varietal\nregions, Napa county and Sonoma county. Winkler heat summation datapoints\nalso clarified several decades ago some of the plant physiologic\nunderpinnings of why Napa county and Sonoma county were the natural leaders\nin premium winegrape production. There are many reasons why the new labeling\nrequirement makes sense from all these perspectives. \n September 01, 2010 at 04:22 PM \n\n\nJohnLopresti said... sorry, I keep forgetting the Fermentation site's html\nprotocol; here is the OIVV label guideline link again:\nhttp://news.reseau-concept.net/images/oiv_uk/Client/OIV_Wine_Labelling_Standard_EN_2006.pdf \n September 01, 2010 at 04:25 PM \n\n\nEl Jefe said... OK, so here's the real requirement: \n \"Any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area established yada yada,\nthat is located entirely within yada yada, shall bear the designation\n\"Sonoma County\" on the label in a type size not smaller than two millimeters\non containers of more than 187 milliliters or smaller than one millimeter on\ncontainers of 187 milliliters or less.\" \n If I recall correctly, this is almost exactly the same as the requirement\nfor the government warning type size. \n So the answer seems pretty clear to me: just add \"Sonoma County\" to the\ngovernment warning. \n September 01, 2010 at 05:00 PM \n\n\nJohnonwine said... \"They [Honore Comfort and the Sonoma County Vintners]\npoint to the prestige that the \"Napa Valley\" designation carries. But this\nprestige has nothing to due with the law that demands \"Napa Valley\", in\naddition to simply \"Rutherford\", be placed on these wines. It has to do\nentirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making \"Napa Valley\"\na place associated with great wines. \n Such an association will not be made with \"Sonoma County\" wines...ever. \n Tom, I would suggest that all Napa wineries, good and bad, benefit from\nhaving Napa Valley on the label; it is indeed a great example of marketing -\nwhat you describe as promotional effort. \n Perhaps the proponents of the law are not doing the job they were hired to\ndo, perhaps the SCV needs a more passionate communicator on their marketing\nteam, putting together the quality promotion you suggest is impossible. \n Sonoma County, with roughly half of the wineries of Napa County, wins\nroughly twice as many gold medals in national and international wine\ncompetitions. That, the fact that their wines cost less on average, and the\nwineries are friendlier, less snooty is a compelling story to get out to the\npublic. \n Heck, if folks knew all that, maybe folks would be seeking out bottles with\n\"Sonoma County\" on the label. \n You suggest that this is a bad law, that Sonoma County will never be\nassociated with high quality wine in the way Napa County is. I disagree, but\nI am eternally hopeful, optimistic that the Sonoma County Vintners will\ninject a little passion and not more of the same old staid and boring in\ntheir marketing communications. I have confidence they will change, retool,\nimprove, live up to their responsibilities. \n I worked selling and marketing Sonoma County wines, I won awards for my\nmarketing efforts. The story is simple. People are receptive to it. Selling\nthe magic of Sonoma County wines is easy. \n That's my take anyway, I don't aim to be contrarian, but I don't mind being\nthe sole supporter of the law - as a Sonoma County born and bred wine guy. \n September 03, 2010 at 08:21 PM\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "Fermentation_Eminent-Domain", "class": "blog"}

This bill, currently in Congress, would give wholesaler\nlobbyists the means to turn back the clock on consumer access to wine, lead\nto the passage of laws that override federal regulations on alcohol, kill\njobs and business that focus on artisan production of wine, beer and\nspirits, punish and dismantle small specialty wine retailers that serve the\nconsumers that wholesalers won't and override the critical Constitutional\nprinciple of a single American economic union...all for the sake of\nprotecting wholesaler profits by giving them unprecedented control and\ninfluence over the entire American alcohol industry.\nBut what is truly remarkable (and likely a result of the wholesalers' hubris\nstemming from 75 years of being granted government welfare) is their\nwillingness to misrepresent facts, ignore the truth, and mislead in their\ndefense of H.R. 5034.\nThe recently launched www.hr5034.org\nwebsite is the creation of the National Beer Wholesalers Association and and\nappears to be the repository all the misrepresentation, ignorance and\nmisleading ideas supporters of H.R. 5034 could possibly muster.\nFor the sake of context and setting the record straight, this post address\nmany of the misrepresentations and misleading claims made at the middlemen's\ndisingenuous new website.\nOn their homepage ( http://www.hr5034.org/ )\n\n\"Today\u2019s system balances competition with public safety to\nensure that consumers can enjoy alcohol without suffering the negative\neffects of an unregulated marketplace\"\n\n\nIs there really any competition when the state-based\nregulatory system the wholesalers love so much require that producers of\nalcohol use a wholesaler to bring their goods to market, meaning that\nwithout use of a wholesaler a producer cannot enter a state's market? It\nalso means that wholesalers get to decide what consumers drink, not\nconsumers.\n\n\n\"Unfortunately the effective state-based regulatory system in\nthe U.S. is under attack. Over the past 10 years,more than 25 states\nhave faced challenges in federal courts to their authority to regulate\nalcohol and their ability to maintain a licensed system of alcohol\ncontrols.\"\nThe only challenges to the state-based alcohol regulatory\nsystem are those that discriminate against interstate commerce for\nprotectionist reasons. Even in the wake of successful suits that\nchallenged the protectionist laws that wholesalers originally pushed,\nthe state retained extraordinarily broad authority to maintain a robust\nsystem of alcohol controls.\n\nON THE \"LEARN MORE\" PAGE ( http://www.hr5034.org/learn-more ) \"Litigation\nagainst the states brought by those wishing to deregulate alcohol for\ntheir own economic interests is of great concern to state alcohol\nregulators, state attorneys general, public health advocates and many\nothers.\"When the economic interests of producers,\nretailers and consumers are horsewhipped by states doing the bidding of\nwholesales who receive more government protection and welfare from the\nstate than any other industry in america, you might expect them to fight\nback. As for those that have \"concern\", let's recall that it's only a\ntiny fraction of state alcohol regulators, that there is no formal\nsupport from state attorneys general, only a mere handful of public\nhealth advocates, a selection of recipients of campaign contributions\nfrom wholesalers and wholesalers themselves that support H.R.\n5034 .\n\n\"According to a recent national poll conducted by the Center\nfor Alcohol Policy, 79% of respondents support the right of individual\nstates to set their own laws and regulations surrounding the sale of\nalcohol and 87% agree that state and local laws regarding alcohol\nregulations should be decided by lawmakers and citizens, not by\njudges.\"\nI'm shocked, shocked i say, that the \"center for alcohol\npolicy\" is an arm of the national beer wholesalers association and that\nit would conduct a poll that finds results supporting those that funded\nthe poll. Does it get any more illegitimate?\n\nOn the \"Fact v. Fiction page ( http://www.hr5034.org/fact-vs-fiction ) \"FACT: This\nbill does not address direct shipping or any specific state alcohol law.\nIt does not preempt a state law that allows direct shipping. It does not\nmandate a direct shipping law where there currently is not one. The bill\ndoes PROTECT a state\u2019s wine shipping law if someone were to challenge it\nin court by providing the shipping law with the same presumption of\nvalidity granted other state alcohol laws.\"Disingenuous in the extreme. And what's worse, the wholesalers knew\nthis when they wrote this. H.R. 5034 gives states the ability to pass\nlaws unchallengeable in court that would discriminate against\nout-of-state wine shippers. And we know such laws would be introduced\ninto various states since wholesalers have seen to it that such laws\nhave been introduced into state legislatures for the past 20 years. In\nfact, H.R. 5034 would allow states to pass laws that make consumers\nreceipt of a wine by in-state shippers legal while making receipt of a\nwine by out-of-state shippers punishable to a greater degree than rape,\nhome invasion or selling cocaine to children. \"Fact:\nProtection of a state\u2019s power to regulate alcohol is not an \u201cindustry\nfood fight.\u201d \"food fight\" may be the wrong word.\nBetter to call the introduction of H.R. 5034 what it is: an attack on\nthe entire alcohol industry and consumers for the sake of protecting\nwholesaler profits. It's no coincidence that brewers large and small,\nwineries, spirit producers and importers, retailers, wine education\norganizations, wine consumers and free trade organizations all oppose\nH.R. 5034.\n\n\n\"This bill does not amend or alter the Federal Alcohol\nAdministration Act (FAA Act) which provides federal guidelines in many\nof these areas\"\nNo it doesn't \"amend\" the faa act. It overrides it entirely.\nTo quote from H.R. 5034:\n\"not withstanding that the state or territorial law\nmay burden interstate commerce or an act of congress, the state law\nshall be upheld...\"\nThis claim by the wholesalers that H.R. 5034 \"does not\namend\" federal regulations on alcohol is a straight up\nmisrepresentation. It's like saying \"i didn't kick the dog, but rather\nhis ribs fell on to my boot\".\n\n\n\"It is the intent of this language to make clear the\ncongressional support for the holding in Granholm-prohibiting state laws\nthat allow an in-state winery to do something a similarly situated\nout-of-state winery cannot do. Language that bars facial discrimination\nis included in the bill to codify this prohibition\"\nI have great faith in the wholesalers' ability to mislead.\nBut this goes beyond even my expectation. The intent of H.R. 5034 is\nprecisely to overturn the granholm v. Heald supreme court decision that\ndid away with protectionist state alcohol laws. More importantly, the\nvery language of H.R. 5034 gives states the explicit right to\ndiscriminate against out-of-state wine shippers. All the state needs to\ndo is offer the feeblest of justifications. Read for yourself: \"state or\nterritorial regulations may not facially discriminate, without\njustification, against out-of-state producers of alcoholic beverages in\nfavor of in-state producers.\" one of those \"justifications\", the bill\nstates, is maintenance of the \"structure of the state alcoholic beverage\ndistribution system.\" in other words, discrimination is ok as long as\nthe discrimination is written into the state's alcohol beverage\ndistribution laws. Furthermore, note that wine retailers are not even\ncovered by this duplicitous language on \"justification\". The state needs\nno justification to discriminate against out-of-state retailers. \n\n\n\"Over half the states have been sued challenging their\nalcohol laws. The lawsuits have attacked items such as commonsense\nsafeguards that require a face-to-face transaction (needed for I.D.\nchecks) to buy alcohol\"\nIn fact, face-to-face transactions are not needed for I.D\nchecks. We know this because states have written laws that have gone\nunchallenged that require I.D. Checks to be made at the point of\ndelivery of the wine. \n\n\n\"Unelected judges should not set alcohol policy; this\nresponsibility rightly rests with individual state legislatures, as\nguaranteed under the 21st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\"\nJudges never have set policy. State legislatures always\nhave. This is the big lie the wholesalers tell. Judges merely tell the\nstate when they have reached beyond what the 21st Amendment allows.\nAfter that, the state legislatures, in every state where litigation has\naffected badly crafted laws, went about legislating a fix. Surely the\nwholesalers don't mean to say that state alcohol laws should in no way\nbe required to abide by the principles in the u.S. Constitution. What\nnext, will the wholesalers argue the 21st amendment give the states the\nright to prohibit women from buying alcohol? Will they argue that state\nlaws banning African-Americans from being distributors is legal under\nthe 21st Amendment?\n\n\n\"State laws that raise concerns can and should be addressed\nin the state legislature.\"\nLucky for Americans it wasn't this attitude that ruled the\nday when jim crow laws were in place. The wholesalers would have argued\nthat the racist \"separate but equal\" philosophy had no business being\nlitigated and that we should wait for the legislatures that enacted the\nracist laws to overturn them with new laws. We have courts precisely to\nadjudicate concerns with the fairness and constitutionality of state\nlaws. But of course, wholesalers know this. They to have brought states\nto court over alcohol distribution laws they didn't think were fair or\nconstitutional. It appears that wholesalers don't like the courts\ninvolved when the decision don't go their way.\n\nThe hypocrisy, misleading notions and disinformation being featured at the\nwholesalers website supporting H.R. 5034 is staggering. However, they do the\nright thing when they invite readers to sign up for emails that will deliver\n\"the latest developments\". I urge all readers to sign up for those emails .\nIn the mean time, please checkout the website that spurred the wholesalers to\nlaunch their own: http://www.stophr5034.org. It is published by the\nSpecialty Wine Retailers Association and upon reading through it, you should\nfind yourself feeling much cleaner and less soiled than after wading through\nthe misrepresentations of the new wholesaler-sponsored website on H.R.\n5034.\n\n> Comments\n Scott said...

In Oregon for instance there are about 60 wholesalers\ncompeting for partnerships on both the supply and the demand side,\nhardly the ideal monopoly situation. In most cases where state laws\nallow shipping you can get a bottle of wine shipped from the winery of\nyour choice. A very important point to remember: While large \"commercial\nwineries\" (Factory wine producers) may have the ability to market their\nown wine, smaller growers whom you seem to be so concerned about do not\nhave the proper infrastructure to allow wine sales on line in many\ncases, let alone having their own transportation infrastructure. They\nare experts at farming and producing wine, which is what they likely\nprefer to do in most cases.

Oh, the numbers look good, but when you dig a little deeper a\ndifferent picture emerges. Walls filled with off topic conversations at best,\nvile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst. What happened? Wasn't\nhaving thousands of fans supposed to be a good thing?\nWell, yes and no. Sure, it's great having several hundred thousands fans. But how\ndid you come to get those fans? Did you earn them through fantastic customer\nservice, fulfilling the brand promise, providing value to the community in an\nauthentic and passionate voice, or did you run a Facebook ad campaign and hit\nthe broadcast airwaves with a promotion?\nLet's look at \u00a0 my old favorite , TGI Friday's:\n If you can see this, then you might need a Flash Player upgrade or you need to\ninstall Flash Player if it's missing. Get Flash Player\nfrom Adobe. \nRemember that ad? Pretty cool, right? In fact, as I recall, they got over 1\nmillion Facebook fans. Google TGI Friday's Fan Woody and it looks pretty good.\nBut then something not so awesome happened. All those fans wanted their free\nburgers and they wanted them now! TGI Friday's completely lost control of the\npage and eventually doled out a lot of free burgers.\u00a0Now from a short term\nperspective I'm sure they did ok on the deal. People came in and ate their food.\nBut they could have accomplished that with coupons in the mail, the newspaper or\nby an email list. But they decided to go the Social Media route.\nNow, let's take a look at what the Friday's FanWoody Facebook\u00a0page looks like\ntoday:\nWhoops! It's gone.\nApparently Woody and his\n900,000+ fans went poof . How come? I'm guessing it had something to do\nwith the venom and general anarchy the page had created by buying fans rather\nthan growing them. A TGI\nFriday's Facebook page does exist, with roughly a third of the fans they\nused to have. TGI Friday's pretty much had to spray Agent Orange on\ntheir relationship with 600,000 people.\nIt's easy to pick on TGI Friday's but they certainly aren't the only guilty\nparty. I think plenty of brands have heard the siren call of Facebook ads. The\nability to target your demo is really terrific, but you're in danger of creating\na relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a \"what have you done for\nme lately\" foundation.\nFirst, you essentially bought these fans. You paid Facebook for the right to\ntarget them. Then in the case of TGI Friday's or other brands that offer free\nproduct or discount coupons, you are essentially buying them again. This sets up\na pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with\na tangible item, that is, free stuff. That's not a bonus item, it's now a\nstandard part of the agreement. Want me as a fan? Give me free stuff.\nThe point of Social Media isn't to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to\nengage with a brand for a whole host of reasons, often free / discounted product\nis the least of these reasons. I'm not saying that special bonuses, or 'surprise\nand delight' offers aren't ever a good thing. I think when used properly they\ncan be terrific. What do I mean by used properly? As a reward for people who\nhave engaged with the brand in a meaningful way. Send us a picture of you\nwearing a brand t-shirt and sure, you've earned a free sandwich. Recruit some\nfriends and I'm happy to give you all some coupons. But when fans enter the\nrelationship feeling they are entitled to free samples and you're in\ntrouble.\n\n\n\n\n Kathy Sharpe says: April 18, 2010 at 1:02 pm\n\nAbout time there was some acknowledgement of the true value of fans. Even if\nyou have 3 million+ fans and they are all well behaved citizens what is the\nreal marketing value?\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "How_soon-Fans", "class": "blog"}

Lebron James Makes His Decision: The A-Rod\nRoute\n8 Jul 2010\nby Rick\n\nLebron James is an extremely talented basketball player. He's also a very astute\nindividual who understands how to use the media -- and various communication\nchannels -- to his advantage. He's also managed to surround himself with people\nwho understand business, but I'm starting to wonder if he's lost a bit of\nunderstanding of American culture.\nLebron didn't play college basketball, he went straight from high school to the\npros, and since joining the Cleveland Cavaliers he's won exactly zero NBA\nchampions. \u00a0He's a free agent now and tonight he made his decision about which\nteam he's going to play for in a very public manner, with a live announcement on\nESPN.\nEarlier this week Lebron jumped on Twitter and quickly gained a massive\nfollowing. This morning he announced:\n\nLebron James was of course a trending topic and that hashtag was burning as\nwell.\nBut I'm starting to wonder if Lebron isn't painting himself into a corner, and\nhas maybe misread how quickly sentiment can change.\nSure, Shaquille O'Neal once said,\u00a0 \"I've won\nat every level but college and pro,\" but Shaq was always a larger than\nlife (literally) character who was outgoing and had a great relationship with\nfans. That's one of the reasons\u00a0\nShaq's been a huge hit on Twitter . Lebron doesn't have that sort of\nrelationship with fans. I think an appropriate comparison might be Alex\nRodriguez. An incredibly talented player -- perhaps the best in the game -- who\nwent a very long time without winning a ring.\nBy making his announcement in this public way, Lebron has only heaped more\npressure on himself. Ask A-Rod how the media can turn on you when you put\nyourself above your teammates, above the game. \u00a0James now finds himself in the\nfollowing position:\n1. Winning a title is expected immediately wherever he goes\n2. Not winning a title will be seen as a massive disappointment\n3. Winning a title will result in some saying that he couldn't do it alone\n4. He's put himself in a position where if he leaves Cleveland, every other city\n(and Cleveland) will be rooting against him\nSounds just like Alex Rodriguez, doesn't it? I'm no longer the target demographic\nfor most of the products Lebron endorses, but you know what matters to me?\nWinning championships. Not live prime time press conferences, not\nself-aggrandizing twitter hashtags and not quitting on his teammates during the\nplayoffs.\nLet's see what the future holds for Lebron. We know he'll be rich, but how will\nhe be viewed by fans across the country. Perhaps Lebron should have hired a\u00a0\nChief Culture Officer along with his coterie of other advisors. If I\nwere to fulfill that role for him, I would have told him to go low key with this\ndecision and let it be led by his new team. Make sure it's clear that the team\ncomes first and that he's looking forward to being\u00a0part of the team.\u00a0That the\nonly thing that matters is winning a championship.\nThat that\u00a0was the main factor.\nUpdate:\u00a0\nLebron chooses the Miami Heat and the similarities to A-Rod continue,\nwith Dwyane Wade playing the role of Derek Jeter.\nUpdate 2: And so it begins...\n\n\n\n\nOne Comment\n\n Dan Winkler says: July 9, 2010 at 1:29 am\n\nHeatenfreude?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "How_soon-Lebron-James", "class": "blog"}

As evidence of how thoroughly corrupt the region is, I\npresent a picture (courtesy of her) of the cabin she'll be staying in free of\ncharge until July:\n That's the view she'll be writing her dissertation to the next two months. The region is poor\n(though not so much as I thought) and\npoorly serviced by internet and wifi: there's a router up the hill from her which sometimes\nprovides wifi, but only then into a loft too unbearably hot to occupy during the day. So the\nonly opportunity I have to talk to her (via Skype) is that last hour in the late evening when\nthe loft cools enough to be habitable\u2014provided, of course, that the wifi strength that evening\nis strong enough to establish and maintain a connection. Which it frequently isn't. But this\npost isn't about how melancholy I become when I haven't heard from her by 3 p.m. (which would be\nmidnight over there), because anyone who follows me on Facebook already knows that and because this post concerns Urbino, not my daily descent into emo. \nI've written about Urbino before , but because the wife is providing me with such dazzling photographs\nof the city, I feel compelled to do so again. As I noted in that post, Urbino is not a\n\"built\" city so much as an \"evolved\" one. (The De Landa seems to\nhave become an unwitting\ntheme of late.) Of course it was built , but it was built vertically\nwithin the city walls, meaning that new buildings were constructed atop\nexisting ones like so:\n The effect is the sort of architecture one only finds in dreams or representations of them,\nlike the one in the finale of the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire\nSlayer , wherein Joss Whedon took advantage of contiguous three-walled film sets to depict\nXander Harris moving seamlessly from the upstairs bathroom at Buffy's house:\n\nInto the Initiative's underground bunker: \nThen, from the bathroom-Initiative across the hall:\nInto his parent's basement:\nAnd into an ice cream truck:\nPast the the come-hither lesbians:\nThrough the back of the ice cream truck:\nBy means of a passage: \nThat returns him to you guessed it his parents' basement:\nIn which he exits the same door he originally entered it from Buffy's house only to end up in\nthe halls of Sunnydale High and (shortly) an Apocalypse Now parody:\n The only difference between what Whedon did and Urbino is that you could travel through the\nside streets of Urbino with a camera and accomplish such feats (minus the Coppola) without needing to cut once . Because without leaving officially sanctioned\nlanes of transportation, pedestrians can venture into and through outdoor kitchens, university\ndepartments, the central hallway of apartment buildings, and so on. This photograph of the\ndueling signs for the Hotel Raffaello the wife snapped the other day typifies the way the city\nfeels:\n You can enter the hotel either through the door with the green awning or the second story\nwindow of an adjacent building. (This isn't technically true, but it accurately describes how it\nfeels to those unaccustomed to the city's geography.) The city is even\nmore disturbing, though, because of the tendency of its sidewalks to transform into recessed\nbrick ladders when the street becomes too steep for bipeds\n: That picture is not from the current set, as the relative quality attests, and if I remember\ncorrectly\u2014by which I mean, \"recognize the fingerprints of amateur photographers the world\nover who think a 'good' photograph is one framed in the most dull and predictable way\npossible\"\u2014snapped by me.* I only mention that because in 2002 I visited the city with the\nwife and, as you probably guessed, the real point of this post was to indulge in a bit of\nvicarious vacationing before returning to a stack of ungraded papers that no amount of actual\ngrading seems to have the power to reduce. \n*If it wasn't, even Homer nods? No, but seriously, if that's not a picture I actually took,\nit's exactly the sort I relentlessly take, whereas check out the wife's chops above: the woman has\nan eye .\n\n\n\nIf she is working, she is not on vacation. AND this time apart will make you stronger and\nmake you realize marriage is work and you need to put some in or the marriage dies and you are\nleft with an empty hole in your heart. I know this is over kill, but you need to get out of\nthe funk you are in and grade the papers and finish the course so you can get some down time\nand catch up on your sleep.\n Posted by: alkau | Wednesday, 26 May 2010 at 11:11 AM\n\n\nhave a happy vacation that place looks fascinating I should get a passport\n Posted by: happyfeet | Wednesday, 26 May 2010 at 09:57 PM\n\n\nhappy, I don't normally like to contradict you, but in this case I must: I'm not the one on\nvacation, sadly.

I talk about it in my Green\nCulture talk. IMHO, we all have an ethical obligation to offset our carbon\nfootprint -- now. My wife and I have been doing so for a couple years. We're a\ncouple months late buying credits for last year.\n\nOne reason we're late (other than the obvious) is the insane complexity in\ncalculating it well. I travel way too much. That's the biggest chunk to cover.\nBut to calculate it accurately requires churning through a pile of flights. I\ncould estimate, no doubt. But I want something more accurate.\n\nSo I was really happy to see on the United page an announcement of a \"Carbon\nOffset Program.\" What I expected it to be was a simple way to at least know what\nthe total carbon footprint from your flights for some period was (after all,\nthey have all the data), and ideally, a simple way to buy offsets.\n\nNo such luck. United has simple linked to one of the million places where you can\ncalculate a per flight carbon cost. It\nallows you to input total miles flown, but its Mileage Plus page doesn't give you\ntotal miles flown, it gives you the\ntotal added to your account (included bonuses, etc.)\n\nLooking forward to version 2.0.\n\nPosted by Lawrence Lessig on April 27, 2009 9:08 AM\n\n\n\nComments (14) April 27, 2009 9:42 AM\n\nPeter Collopy: Dopplr has a nice carbon calculator built-in. You have to\nenter all your trips, but I think it's generally an exciting system if you\ndon't mind the Little Brother surveillance.\n\n\nApril 27, 2009 9:49 AM lessig: GREAT point. I do enter all mine in. Perfect\nsolution.\n\n\nApril 27, 2009 9:53 AM\nPadraic: Why aren't you a supporter of cap & trade? Isn't a mandatory\nscheme going to moresuccesful than voluntary measures?\n\n\nApril 27, 2009 10:20 AM lessig: I favor a mandatory scheme -- internalize\nyour externality. I am suspicious of cap & trade. It seems like a\ncomplicated partial version of that, created by the same genius quants who\ngave us the mess on wall street, that is designed to generate large fees\nfinance types. My sense is for a simpler system.\n\n\nApril 27, 2009 12:07 PM Padraic Ryan: Re: cap & trade - you shouldn't use\nthe financial crisis as an excuse to write off all of economics. A cap &\ntrade system worked very well at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution in the\nUS, finance types and all. You're right that a carbon tax is definitely\nsimpler, but there are upsides to cap & trade as well (such as the fact\nthat the market will drive the price up, whereas a tax won't increase unless\nCongress wants it to).\n\nRe: your green culture talk, I think you are misappropriating the Gore clip:\nisn't he saying that your money would be better spent on political\ncandidates and organizations that push for mandatory internalizing of\nexternalities (changing the laws) instead of on carbon offsets (changing the\nlightbulbs)? My problem with carbon offsets and other voluntary measures is\nthat given the finite amount of money, energy and attention we have to push\nfor the environment, I feel like the opportunity cost of these measures is\ntoo high compared to policy-oriented actions, the citizen role that Gore\nreferred. For example, Earth Hour would be much more productive if it were a\nglobal rally for carbon taxes; instead we de-politicize it and entertain the\nidea that voluntarily turning off lights will stop climate change.\n\nI'm a big fan of your work on IP and corruption, but I'm skeptical of these\ninitial ventures into the environmental arena...\n\n\nApril 27, 2009 12:17 PM mark: \"I am suspicious of cap & trade. It seems\nlike a complicated partial version of that, created by the same genius\nquants who gave us the mess on wall street, that is designed to generate\nlarge fees finance types.

(I use it to calculate\nhow many I'll get towards my premier status.) It's a tiny link they move\naround from time to time, but look for it near where the seat selection\noption is. You should see this on a screen before you purchase the ticket,\nand possibly also after.\n\n\nApril 27, 2009 4:45 PM Brad Templeton: When I got to United's site it has two\ncolumns, one for true miles flown (sort of) and one for elite bonus. So cut\nand paste into your spreadsheet and it should be fine. However, it does show\n500 for the short haul flights, but I bet those are mostly L.A. so you can\nfill in the real mileage to L.A. on those, it should not take long. April\n27, 2009 6:03 PMYaacov Iland: I'd check into the effectiveness of carbon\noffsets, particularly tree plantations, before spending money on them:\nhttp://www.newint.org/features/2006/07/01/keynote/\n\n\nApril 28, 2009 9:03 AM Jardinero1: The only way to reduce your carbon\nfootprint, is to reduce your carbon footprint, period. Paying someone else\nto do something they are doing, already, does not reduce your carbon\nfootprint one bit.\n\nIf you don't believe that and still insist on paying someone else to consume\nless, then please consider paying me. My wife and I telecommute. We rarely\ntravel. I ride my bike to the grocery store. We cook from whole ingredients\nand never eat processed or prepared foods. Both of our cars are high mpg and\nrarely used. They are both ten years old and we probably won't replace them\nfor another ten years. I just finished insulating my house and installed\nhigh efficiency windows and HVAC. I keep the thermostat high in the summer\nand low in the winter. All the light bulbs are fluorescent, except for the\ndimmer above the dining room table. I removed all the turf from my property\nand replaced it with vines and perennials. There are twenty three trees on\nthe property sequestering CO2 on a continuous basis. No motorized equipment\nis required to maintain my garden which is now over ten thousand square feet\nof CO2 consuming plants.\n\nI would gladly accept the sum of fifteen thousand dollars from Prof Lessig or\nanyone else to offset his carbon heavy lifestyle. In return, I would submit\nto an audit of my lifestyle and I would issue him a certificate stating the\namount of his carbon offset.\n\n\nApril 29, 2009 4:00 AM Eric the Red: Carbon credits: indulgences for the\nnon-Catholic crowd.

I've posted your feedback on my carbon offsets news blog.\n\nCurrently many companies are reticent to putting something in their purchase\npath as an upsell, just as they are reticent to putting anything in their\npurchase path. The cost for large companies to make any updates to their\ne-commerce sites is significant, another factor in keeping the type of\nprogram you'd like from being available. Additionally, there is a reluctance\nto share the data required for accurate emissions measurement due to\nperceived potential risks, possibly related to future regulatory\nconcerns.\n\nThe technology is certainly available.

{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/blog/Seedbombing", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first in a series of articles by guest blogger The\nApocalyptic Housewife .\n\n\n\nSomewhere in California, a blighted, mosquito-vector abandoned property is\nabout to get an echinacea dose via seedbomb.\n\nSeedbombing combines elements of childhood disgruntled mudbomb-hurling; the\nbalance of meticulousness and zen that good gardeners possess; and my own\nforte, the invisibility and vigilance of a sniper.\n\nIt also requires a certain attitude. The first step to seedbombing is: 1.\nUnderstand that a job worth doing is worth doing crappily.\n\nYou will fuck it up . Live with this. Embrace it. \nNothing worth\ndoing was learned perfectly the first time. If Mother Nature herself were\nperfect, she wouldn't need us urban urchins to help cover her\nscars with flowering seeds.\n\nHere's where we started -\n\n\nGift seeds of California Poppy via Jessica Reeder's mom. Thanks,\nMamaHun.\n\n\n2. Mix in seeds.\n\nUse seeds of any kind, even dumpster-salvaged ones, or the ones that might be too\nold for the garden.\n\nYou can mix them with a 30/30/40 mix of potting soil, worm casings and clay. Or\nyou could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at\nthat estate sale last year and get to mixing.\n\n\nNOTE: Cover your work area. Dust can fly into your mouth and\neyes very easily. If the fertilizer in the mix is what I think it is, that\nwouldn't be pretty. Use gloves to break up the soil with your\nfingers.\n\n\n3. Make bombs.\n\nForm the mix into balls of any size from sling-shot-pellet up to softball.\nYou're going to be throwing them. Customize it yourself.\n\nMine were more or less matzoh-ball size and shape, out of habit. This worked out\npretty well.\n\nAllow to dry overnight, or until they're solid enough for the next\nstep.\n4. Throw.\n\nToday, I kept it simple. I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from\ndowntown, and two vacant lots. The leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the\nfreeway offramps.\n\n\nFirst lesson learned -- you need at least two people to seedbomb from a\nvehicle . The first responsibility should be driving safely. I found this\nhard to do while also avoiding cops, dealing with the camera and the car window,\nscoping out angles of approach for throwing, etc.\n\nI ended up with a broken fingernail and dirt all over my lap. Also, a perfect\nstrike. But you'll have to take my word because a camera at that moment\nwould have been crazy.\n\nSecond Lesson -- keep the seedbombs in a shallow covered container .\nYou want both tidiness and easy access. Plus, those things are crumbly. I made\neight; the last two were totally pulverized after being jostled in a paper bag\nfor half an hour.\n\nAnd the last lesson -- have fun . It's play. Seedbombing is a\nhit-or-miss way for change to take root, pun intended. It's chlorophyll\ngraffiti. No one I know is getting digg'd or favrd yet for throwing color\nand scent around the ghetto. Do it to see how it feels. You may want to keep\nchecking on your flowers (I promise I will) or you might get an idea to do\nsomething else completely unexpected (I did).\n\nEnzo Angolini spike heels found by serendipity at St Paul's Thrift for\n$3.98. Sexy, non?\n\n\nFor example, make smaller wildflower seedbombs and carefully 'plant' them\nin a meridian by making holes in the ground with your heel and then gently tamping\nthe dirt over them with your sole.\n\nThis is also good practice for looking lost and cluelessly invisible. More on that in\nfuture posts.\n\n5. Enjoy.\n\n\nEarth is my friend, like that old classmate who you keep forgetting to drop a note to\non Facebook.\n\n\nWhen I took a victory lap and hand-wash break in the mall, I was happy, not in a\nsmug superior way, but in the knowledge that I had avenged myself against the\nwhole Sunday-at-the-mall culture that I felt smothered by. I did it by throwing\nflowers all along those places no one goes, but where our planet's future\nlives.\n\nThere is one over-riding message to this -- Quit being such a goddamned\nperfectionist. Yes, yes, I know, you know of much better places\nto never throw those seedbombs you haven't made. You could get better soil\nif you put it on the shopping list. You undoubtedly write much better and could\nhave a real serious article with awesome non-blurry pictures taken by a person\nwho actually can get the timer to work for a goddamn change. The actions that\nyou never do are absolutely perfectly effective, in your imagination.\nBut my actions accomplished something today.\n\nWhich brings us back to: 1.

First the holocaust survivor who said she was literally\nraised by wolves turns out to be just a regular, if depressed, person. Now, Margaret\nSeltzer, the author of Love and\nConsequences , the highly acclaimed \"memoir\" about her life as a half Native American/half\nWhite gang banger, has been been explosed as a fraud.\n\nIn the vividly told book, Ms. Seltzer wrote about her African-American foster brothers,\nTerrell and Taye, who joined the Bloods gang when they were 11 and 13. She chronicled her\nexperiences making drug deliveries for gang leaders at age 13 and how she was given her first\ngun as a birthday present when she was 14. Ms. Seltzer told The Times last week, \u201cOne of the\nfirst things I did once I started making drug money was to buy a burial plot.\u201d\n\nIt's like a satire of a satire. This is my favorite line in the whole NYT article: \"Sarah\nMcGrath, the editor at Riverhead who worked with Ms. Seltzer for three years on the book, said\nshe was stunned to discover that the author had lied.\" Gotta love that understatement and comic\ntiming.\n\nBut seriously, you may remember an article last summer that appered in TimeOut New York\nabout matters of race in publishing. (My post on the subject here .) This\nwas one of most important quotes from the article: \u201cInvariably,\u201d says Craig, \u201ca\nblack-themed book will come up for consideration, and there won\u2019t be anyone of color to put in\nan opinion, or there\u2019ll be one, who shouldn\u2019t bear the burden alone. So we all pretend we\u2019re\nexperts. Maybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s embarrassed by that.\u201d The end result of such\nroundtables, one can only fear, could be that the only books depicting people of color that\nget published are those that do not challenge white assumptions.\n\n\nI can't help but wonder if Ms. Seltzer's book with all it's far-fetched,\ntales-from-the-urban-jungle flair, would have passed the smell test were it read by a more\ndiverse panel of editors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment #1, by carleen \nI read that article in the Times and IMMEDIATELY thought it was going to be a hoax.

The last thing on my mind was spending money: it was\nbeautiful outside, and there were free things to do everywhere.\n\nBut. When I'd posted on Facebook that I was coming to town, no fewer than three people told me\nI just had to visit the Tupelo Honey Cafe . So I checked their website, and instantly fell in\nlove:\n\n\n\"Tupelo Honey Caf\u00e9 opened in downtown Asheville in 2000, an early pioneer in\nthe farm to fork movement and an active advocate for the independent\nrestaurant landscape that pervades the city. Our food is fresh, made from\nscratch, sassy and scrumptious. Our cuisine salutes our love of Southern\ntraditions at the table, but like the good people of Asheville, marches to\nits own drum. The result is a unique riff on Southern favorites.\" tupelohoneycafe.com\n\n\nI was convinced but I wasn't alone. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, the waiting list\nwas an hour long. After hemming and hawing and assessing my food stash\n(contents: 10 saltines), I decided to go for it anyway.\n\nBy the time I finally got a seat at the counter, I was starved. It took me about\nthirty seconds to pick out the Charleston Chicken Sandwich: \"grilled\nmarinated free-range chicken breast on sourdough with melted havarti, romaine\nlettuce and cranberry mayonnaise\". Free range? Cranberry? Havarti? Yes, I\ncould dig it.\n\nWhile I waited for the food, I checked out the back of the store where Tupelo\nHoney Cafe hawks their homestyle wares: preserves, pickles, salsa, honey,\nt-shirts, aprons and all sorts of mini-advertisements for the restaurant.\n\nI've visited plenty of farm-to-fork restaurants, and this one may be the best\nI've seen at self-marketing. There's nothing wrong with it: the food in those\njars is probably delicious, though I question whether the $10 tupelo honey had\nto come from Florida or if it's produced locally.\n\nEither way, it's nice to see a restaurant built on ethics that also happens to be\nincredibly busy. Some of that is surely due to good marketing, but the real\nreason for its popularity is this:\n\nThat sandwich was so good, I found myself eating slower and slower with each bite\nto savor it more completely. The potatoes were light and un-greasy; the flavors\nwere perfectly balanced; the chicken was juicy and rich; and let's be honest\nhere, I'm always happier eating dead animals when I know they've lived a good\nlife. I found myself silently thanking the chicken for its delicious\ncontribution. Thank you, chicken. I will never forget you.\n\nI stopped eating halfway through, not because I was full. I stopped so I could\ntake the rest home and taste it again later.\n\n\nOn another topic, I made a discovery there in the Tupelo Honey Cafe, one which\nI'd like to share with you now.\n\nIf you're going to a busy restaurant and want great service, bring a camera. Take\na few photos of the menu, the kitchen, the food.\n\nNo sooner had I taken the above photo, when a server (not even my server)\nappeared at my elbow. Later when I stopped eating and lifted my napkin from my\nlap, it took approximately three seconds for someone to take my food away to be\nboxed up.\n\nNow, I'm not saying the service before my camera-flash was bad, because it was\nawesome. But wow, it sure improved once I appeared to be some sort of food\ncritic or travel writer.\n\nWhich, it just so happens, I am. But even if you're not, try this out sometime. I\ncan't guarantee it'll work, but I personally will do it againand probably back\nit up with a stellar review, just like the one I've given the Tupelo Honey\nCafe.\n\nEverybody wins.\n\nOkay, that's it! I could talk about Asheville for weeks, but it's time to move\non. Next stop: sunny Tennessee, where I get down on The Farm.\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "Tupelo-Honey-Cafe", "class": "blog"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/blog/Uprooted_Bike", "text": "\n\n\n\nSave the World, Ride a Bike\na visit to Troy Bike Rescue\n\n30. Sep, 2009\n\nThis post is the first of a three-part series on bike culture. Come back Friday to read about\nanarchy,\nbike jousting, and two-wheeled social protest .\n\nRemember when you got your first bike? Was it a Christmas present, or maybe a birthday gift?\nRemember how much fun you used to have on that bike, how fast you went, how great it felt?\nWell, these days, most kids want an Xbox for their birthday; their parents ride around in\ncars with seatbelts, talking on their\nphones . Cycling is a thing of the past: a sport, a hobby, but rarely a mode of\ntransportation. But I'm here to tell you: riding your bike is still fun, and\nstill fast, and it's the cheapest and most socially responsible workout you'll ever\nget .\nAnd there are no two ways about it: if you give a kid a bike, that kid will ride.\nIn Troy, New York, I met one Andrew Lynn. He's somewhat of a man\nbrain\ntrust , and one of his best creations is the Troy Bike Rescue . It started in 2001, when Andrew\nwould ride around town pulling bikes out of dumpsters. He started hosting work parties with\nfriends in his backyard, teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding.\nSlowly but surely, the circle grew and Andrew's backyard parties became weekly workshops.\nWhen Andrew decided to leave town for a few years' schooling in NYC, friends and cohorts took\nover operations. By the time Andrew returned, Troy Bike Rescue (let's call it TBR) had a life\nof its own. These days it's an established club, run by volunteers and donations, turning\ntrashed bikes into treasures. Its influence now includes a legitimate downtown storefront; a\nsister shop in Albany ( Albany Bicycle\nCoalition ); movie screenings and pro-cycling political events; and a dedicated core crew\nthat keeps everything rolling.\n\nTBR's customers run the gamut, from businessmen to street kids to college students to\nfamilies. The one thing they have in common? They get it.\n\nThis group understands the value of a bicycle: more than just transportation, a\nbike is a statement against fossil fuels. More than a toy, it's an equalizer that allows poor\nkids to ride with rich. More than a hobby, it's a way of traveling through the world that lets\nyou interact, use your muscles, breathe fresh air -- all for the cost of a free dumpster\nbike.\n\n\nWhen I visited the TBR shop, it was packed with frames, wheels, gears, chains, handlebars,\nkids, and anarchist art (the space is being donated by some supporters who are also\nanti-capitalist activists).\nTBR hosts workshops twice a week. For a few hours, the doors are open to anyone who walks in.\nTools are available, and volunteers will help with advice and knowledge. Parts can be had for a\npittance, and you can pick out your own bike from the stacks and racks of machines filling the\nspace.\n\nThe main focus of TBR, however, is not selling bikes. The idea is to give people a workspace\nand teach them how to maintain their own bicycle. Self-sufficiency is a major tenet of the bike\nmovement, and Troy Bike Rescue is training self-reliant individuals of all stripes.\nAll around me, college students and bike punks tinkered with their machines. An older man\nasked for tips on tuning his racer. A young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he\nneeded a new one (and, despite Andrew's stern reprimand that he couldn't just walk in every\nweek and leave with a free bike, he did just that).\n\nA dad came in with his three kids, all of whom left with snazzy rides -- but first, they all\nsat down and worked on their new wheels together.\nAnd as we left at the end of the workshop, a woman walked up to Andrew. \"I love what you do,\"\nshe said. \"I have a whole bunch of bikes to give you.\"\nSee, ultimately TBR is about more than just bicycles. It's about building community, and\ntriggering a quiet but inexorable social movement. This is not the world's first bike\ncollective; in fact it's only one of many that have stealthily sprung up around America. These\ncollectives are not waiting for change to happen: they're creating it through small, positive,\npeaceful actions. You too can change the world: all you have to do is ride a\nbike.\nTry This at Home: Ride Around\nFall is here, which (in most places) means great riding weather. What are you waiting\nfor?\nBikes are cheap: you can get one at your local thrift store for $5-50. It doesn't have to be\nperfect, just good enough to get you places. So pick one up, and ride it to the end of your\nblock! Then keep going!\nEven if your life requires four wheels, you can use a bike for local errands. Ride it to the\ncorner store when you need milk, instead of driving across town to the grocery store. (Don't\nlike the milk they sell? Tell the store owner what you like, and see if he'll carry it. Now\nyou're changing the world.)\nOn weekends, instead of driving to the park, hop on your bike and go exploring. It doesn't\nhave to be a workout: you can just toodle around town and look at stuff. Or, if you're a gym\nbuff, trade a workout for a bike ride. Unless you live on a major highway, odds are you can\nride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting.\nOn vacation, rent a bike instead of a scooter (or, God forbid, a Segway). It's cheaper, and\nmuch better for the local flora&fauna.\nStill not convinced? Then think of it this way: by riding your bike instead of driving your\ncar, you're reducing your consumption of fossil fuels. You can even calculate the money you\nsave on gas, and keep it in a jar for a rainy day.\n\nWant to get involved? Bike clubs tend to be pretty anarchic, but if you look around your\ncommunity you'll find both bike riders and shop owners who ride for change. Can't find a bike\ncommunity? Start your own!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Responses to \"Save the World, Ride a Bike\"\n\n\n\n\nKaren Turnbull 01. Oct, 2009 at 12:54 pm\n\nwhat a great article, i will be passing it on.

I passed along\nthis article to her, and she suggest that when we start our own bike rescue, we'll do like the\nU.S. in East Timor did and graffiti Delta Bike Rescue on all the chassis.\nFall is exactly 79% more tingly when experienced by bike.\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "Uprooted_Bike", "class": "blog"}

Read about death \n& carnage in the shell shop , find out about the eco-friendly \nfood scene , look at the pretty pretty sunset , or continue on... \n\nDavid DeWitt doesn't look like a farmer. With his long hair, scruffy beard and\nt-shirt, he'd fit in more at a Phish show than behind a plow. But appearances\nare deceiving, and David's comfy mien belies a passion that is influencing the\nculture of northern Cape Cod.\nTo wit: in 2009, David helped launch the Truro Ag Fair\n -- an event that exceeded all expectations and brought\nhuge crowds to local farmers' booths. He runs the Rock Spray nursery, a\nCertified Natural provider of evergreens and ornamentals. And he manages the\nFirst Light Organic Farm, a lush green spot in a hollow of North Truro. Here,\nDavid and his partner \nArthur Teubner work year-round growing heirloom and hardy fruits and\nveggies to sell at market.\nDavid's a dedicated and inspired agrarian, whose passion for farming keeps him\noptimistic. But farming on the Outer Cape is the sort of Sisyphian challenge\nthat can wear anybody out.\nThe hard truth:\nThe soil of North Truro is not strong enough to support agriculture. Without\nfertilization, it deteriorates shockingly fast.\nDavid points out a patch of sand with a thin strip of fertile loam along the\nedge. Last season it was a fertile veggie bed -- but it was left un-fertilized\nas an experiment.\n\"This is what happens,\" David says. \"You have to keep feeding it\norganic material, or it turns back into sand.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis plot was a test run, left untended for a single\nseason. Last year's rich loam is now useless sand.\n\nIt's always been this way in North Truro. The Outer Cape is really just a spit of\nsand -- but still, farmers lived here for generations. How?\nSalt marsh hay.\nThere used to be a local tradition in this area: at each spring tide , the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes\nto harvest the grasses. This was called \"salt marsh haying\".\nSalt marsh hay has no weed seeds, and it doesn't compact as heavily as other\ntypes of hay. This makes it an excellent and bountiful source of compost, and it\nwas used for generations as a soil enricher. But haying had to happen regularly,\nsays David:\n\"There's so much oxygen in this soil, any added compost gets burned up in six\nweeks. All the nutrients get depleted.\"\nThat means soil left for two months without fresh compost will become -- you\nguessed it -- sand.\nThe only way to keep things going here is to keep a steady flow of compost coming\nin. That means truckloads of hay, and that means a lot of work. Last year, David\nand Arthur brought in a semi truck loaded with leaf mulch. It worked -- but it\ncost money, and it disappeared fast into the hungry ground. Not a long-term\nplan.\nIn bygone times, the whole town of North Truro would pitch in on haying days;\nnow, David's on his own. Without that community support, it's nearly impossible\nfor him to harvest hay often enough to keep the farm green.\nMeanwhile, in Tourist Town USA...\nThe Provincetown farmers market has lovely produce, but little of it was grown on\nthe Cape.\nProvincetown's official population of 3,500\nsupports a tourism industry that serves millions of visitors each year. City\nfolk marvel at the quaint charms of the Cape, its idyllic beauty and simple\npleasures. And then they go out to eat.\nEven if tourists were interested in sustainable food (they totally don't care ), they'd be hard pressed to find a locally-sourced\nmeal. Raina Stefani serves David's produce at her restaurant Terra Luna , but it only makes up a\nportion of her fares: the rest has to be shipped from the mainland. You can't\nsqueeze blood from a stone, and you can't get big vegetable crops from sand\ndunes. End of story.\nWell, not exactly.\nDavid isn't giving up -- in fact, he's got plans and ideas to refashion North\nTruro's farming community. Hence the Ag Fair, and the ongoing experimentation\nwith varieties and soils at First Light. David isn't alone: he's got the support\n(and companionship) of a growing group of gamechangers. If the young farmers and\nfoodies of Truro can organize, they might just be able to get local agriculture\nback on its feet.\nTheir main opponent? The tourism and real estate industries, which insist upon\nturning every arable inch of the Cape into somebody's backyard. The same\npopulation that would consume the food produced here is actively inhibiting its\nproduction.\nNo surprise there. After all, what's the point of farming on the beach?\n\n\n\n2 Responses to \"Farming on Sand\"\n\n Melody M Thibodeau 25. Sep, 2010 at 7:52 am\nIf, someone could start bedding the outer cape's horses, with this Hay/Straw.\nYou know they could. It would be even better for the system. This would\nalso, make it more profitable. The horses. would be heathier. They wouldn't\nhave to be standing on the acidic sand all of the time.

These archetypes seem different to me than other 'trends'. Surely the\nVampire was dead after the spoof, \"Love at First Bite \" in 1979. But then the Anne Rice -led revival brought it\nback (technically the 1st \u00a0book, Interview with the\nVampire , \u00a0was published in 1976, but didn't gain widespread popularity until\nlater). Then it jumped the shark with the Tom Cruise-Brad Pitt movie (based on the Anne Rice novel) in 1994. But\nbubbling below the surface was Blade and other genre flicks, then Twilight hit and now vampires are hot. \n Surely Ninjas were done with horrible movies like American Ninja (1985) or with\ncomedies starring Chris Farley ( Beverly Hills Ninja , 1997), and yet Ninja has become a replacement word for\n'expert' to the point where it's almost accepted parlance: A twellow search for\n'ninja' turned up more than 7,000 Twitter accounts using the term in their\nprofiles. \u00a0 Ninja Warrior is one of the\nmost popular shows on G4. \nWe can put Pirates away now after the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean flick, right? No, actually, if we've learned\nanything it's that genre memes just go back underground ( Pirates for adults [NSFW]You get\nthe point0. These characters are like Zombies (pun intended), they just keep coming\nback to life.\nSo it's not just a matter of knowing when to jump off the Vampire merry-go-round,\nit's knowing when (and where) to jump back on. If you jumped off Vampires would you\nhave known to jump back on in time to publish Twilight? Fourteen literary agents\nrejected it before Stephenie Meyer got a deal. \u00a0If you were off Zombies would you\nhave gotten back on it time to publish NY Times bestseller Pride & Prejudice and Zombies ? I don't think you can \"get off\" any\nof these, you have to triangulate your decision across several nodes of popular\nculture, a triangulation that has to revolve around the audience (young adult --\nTwilght. mature -- True Blood) and sub-genre (comedy, horror, sci-fi...) and then the\nactual quality of the content. So what sort of matrix board do you have to create to\nknow that a NC-17 comedy horror Zombie video game will work, but a PG-13 young adult\ntime-travelling Vampire TV show won't? You can't. \u00a0All you can do is hope you bat\n.300 and that when you fail, you fail\nfast .\nAhh, the classics.\nIf you broaden your scope a bit, I think it would be difficult to find a time over\nthe last 40 years or so when any of these four archetypes didn't have a level of\nbubbling popularity via books, comic books, tv, movies, video games, music. If all\nyou're looking at is 1 or 2 content categories maybe it looks like they're dead, but\nthey may be flourishing elsewhere, and like a virus they're just waiting for a new\nhost to carry them to the mainstream. Publishers, producers, editors, TV\nexecs, they all have to calibrate their decisions based on so many factors, and yet\neven with access to sophisticated data it often comes down to human factors. A gut\ninstinct that something is going to work. Somebody at AMC is greenlighting The Walking Dead based partly on historical evidence that says people like\nZombies, but also partly on the notion that this particular iteration will have a new\ntwist that will bring new people into the (zombie and\nAMC) tent . Personally, I'm waiting for someone to make Pirate Zombies v. Ninja\nVampires.

The reason that I share this with you is my respect for you as a\nCEO, a business leader and a person.  My wife is one of your employees who\nroutinely shares stories about you that are nothing less than inspiring.  I\nknow that during difficult times, sometimes words emerge that can help\npeople through difficult times.  I believe that you are sincere man and\nknow that you must be broken hearted, but I hope that this article can help\nyou lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly.  My wife, Shelly\nPierce, has worked for Enron for the past two years and like many of your\nemployees, has lost a great deal of her life savings.  Of course, I accept\nmost of the blame for this for reasons related to this article.  I lost my\ninvestment discipline and held out the false hope that Enron could not\nfalter.  After reading the article to her while I was out of town, I\nbelieve that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face the\nchallenges that lay before you.\n\nMr. Lay, I appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and our\nfamily and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successes.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom the USA Today, Tuesday, November 27, 2001, page 15A.\n\n\"In recession, face brutal facts, thrive\"\n\n\nBy Jim Collins\n\nA man in his early 20s recently asked me, \"So what's a recession like?\"\nIts an entirely alien concept to him; he'd grown up during the greatest\neconomic boom in modern memory.  His question drove home the fact that we\nhaven't faced a severe, protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades,\nleaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times.\n\nWith this recession - long in coming, perhaps long to stay - now\nofficially upon us, it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key\nlesson about how great companies (and great people) deal with difficult\ntimes differently from how they deal with merely good ones.  That lesson is\nthe \"Stockdale Paradox,\" a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge\nfrom tough times not just intact, but stronger.\n\nAdm. Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in the\nHanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War.  Tortured many times during his\n8-year imprisonment, Stockdale lived without any prisoner's rights, no set\nrelease date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his\nfamily.\n\nHe shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war\nagainst his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda.\nAt one point, he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor,\ndeliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an\nexample of a \"well-treated prisoner.\"  He exchanged secret intelligence\ninformation with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery\nwould mean more torture and perhaps death.  After his release, Stockdale\nbecame the first three-star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both\naviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nYou can understand, then, my anticipation at the prospect of spending\npart of an afternoon with Stockdale, who happened to be at the Hoover\nInstitute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford.  In\npreparation, I read In Love and War, the book he and his wife wrote to\nchronicle their experiences those 8 years.\n\nAs I read the book, I found myself getting depressed.  It just seemed\nso bleak - the uncertainty of his fate, the brutality of his captors.  And\nthen it dawned on me:  Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable office,\nlooking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.\nI'm getting depressed reading this, and I know that he gets out, reunites\nwith his family and becomes a national hero.  If it feels depressing for\nme, how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not\nknow the end of the story?\n\n\"I never lost faith in the end of the story,\" Stockdale said when I\nasked him.  \"I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I\nwould prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of\nmy life that, in retrospect, I would not trade.\"\n\nI didn't say anything for many minutes, and we continued the slow walk\ntoward the faculty club, Stockdale limping and arc-swinging his leg, still\nstiff from repeated torture.  Finally, I asked, \"Who didn't make it out?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's easy,\" he said.  \"The optimists.\"\n\n\"The optimists?  I don't understand,\" I said, completely confused.\n\n\"The optimists.  Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be\nout by Christmas.'  And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go.  Then\nthey'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.'  And Easter would come, and\nEaster would go.  And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas\nagain.  And they died of a broken heart.\"\n\nAfter another long pause, he turned to me and said, \"This is a very\nimportant lesson.  You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in\nthe end - which you can never afford to lose - with the need for discipline\nto confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they\nmight be.\"\n\nMy conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me, but I\nnever really considered it a business lesson until my research team began\nto wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to\nbecome great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties\nweakened and dispirited.  We found that companies that became great\nembraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradox.\n\nFannie Mae, for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing $1M\nevery business day, with $56B in loans under water.  Many analysts thought\nFannie Mae, which was getting 9% on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15%\non the debt it issued, was doomed.\n\nBut CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not\nmerely survive, but also to prevail as a great company.  Yes, they\nconfronted the brutal fact that the interest-rate problem was not going to\nmagically disappear (certainly not by Christmas).  But they used this grim\nfact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based on\nasking three central questions of greatness:\n\n\n        What can we potentially do better than any other company in the\n        world?\n        \n\n        What can best drive our economic engine?\n        \n\n        What best ignites the passions of our people?\n        \n\n    Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring,\nFannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions.\nEventually, it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the\ngeneral stock market.\n\nWhen asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote\nFannie Mae off, Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company.\n\"Of course, we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things, but we never\nentertained the possibility that we would fail.   We were going to use the\ncalamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company.\"\n\nThe sad truth is that most executive teams won't respond that way to\nthese dark days of uncertainty.  Instead of using this recession as an\nopportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture\nof discipline, the will simply restructure, lay off a bunch of people and\nliquidate their cultural equity.  Mediocre leaders will hold out false\nhopes for a quick fix, only to watch those hopes be swept away by events.\nTheir companies will begin to die of a broken heart.\n\nIt need not be this way.  Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox -\nthose who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail\nin the end, but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal\nfacts of reality - will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce\ngreatness.\n\n    Used correctly, this recession can be a defining time in your firm's\nhistory that , in retrospect, you would not trade.  Used wrongly, this\nrecession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to\nbecome great.  The choice is yours.\n\n    Jim Collins, the author of Good to Great, operates a\nmanagement-research laboratory in Boulder, Colo.\n\nRegards,\n\nSteve\n\nSteve Alexander\nVice President, North American Artemis Consulting\nArtemis International Solutions Corporation\nOffice:  +1 281.338.9616\nMobile:  +1 281.830.7430\nwww.artemisintl.com\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "12176", "class": "email"}

I attended a meeting \nthis afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups \npromoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming \nWTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week \nand met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee \nlooking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was \namong the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have \nan interest.\n\nSince returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her \nthe above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send \nher the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. \nOne of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of \nthese items to Delhi. \n\nJoe\n\n\nJoe Hillings\n09/08/99 11:57 AM\nTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ashok \nMehta/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John \nAmbler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, \nJeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron)\nSubject: India And The WTO Services Negotiation\n\nSanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and \ninvolvment.\n\nA group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services \nCoalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include \"energy \nservices\" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS \n2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among \nthe CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and \ncover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, \ninvestment, etc.\n\nThis morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him \nabout our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. \nAfter all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other \ncompanies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy \nservices. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them \nin India and possibly abroad.\n\nSudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the \nservices round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees \nwith the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with \ncompanies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask \nthat energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me \nthat India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key \nperson to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make \nsuch a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.\n\nI will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I \ndistributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to \nSudaker today.\n\nEveryone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in \nthis issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to \nhave an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.\n\nPlease review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get \nsomething done in October.\nJoe\n\nPS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World \nServices Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I \nhave noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but \nnot on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to \nparticipate.\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "173252", "class": "email"}

Brulte\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings All:\n\nFirst, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i\ns\nvery tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this\nmorning, with some back-up info that I've included below.\n\nAttached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f\nor\ndelivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:\n\nI don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would\nbe appreciated.\nAs we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on\nWednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to \"wallpaper\" Sacramento wi\nth\nour proposed legislation.\nThis email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the \"final\" version\ns\nof our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I\nbelieve Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.\nYou'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver \nto\nhis office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on\nWednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed\nlegislation to the rest of the world at the same time.\nWhen we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would\ndetermine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same\ntime that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will\nhandle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom\nyou've decided to circulate.\nThis email does, however, include a \"summary\" of our proposed legislation. \nBut I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the\nappropriate language to distribute \"to the world,\" or if we'll need instead\nto tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a \"one\npager\" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the\npackage effectively.\nWe also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our\nproposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul\nd\npropose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the\nDirect Access coalition?\nWe also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the \nPR\nmachinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our\nlegislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we\ncan discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted\nMarathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.\nYou'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR\ncredit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.\n \nYou note that attached to the email is a \"legislative fix\" to AB1X that cou\nld\nsolve the credit issue and an attached set of \"taking points\" related to a\nsecond alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying tha\nt\nDWR will get its money for power purchase costs.\nNote also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to\nget the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a\nbrief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section\n(legislative solution) under the topic \"create a real competitive retail\nmarket in California.\"  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have\nlegislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to\ndiscuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please\ndon't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.  I can be best\nreached to day by pager at 888.916.7184. \n\nThanks to all for helping pull this together.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 02/16/2001 08:27 AM -----\n\nJeff Dasovich\nSent by: Jeff Dasovich\n02/15/2001 06:11 PM\n\n To: jdasovic@enron.com, skean@enron.com, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@En\nron,\nJames D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron\n cc:\n Subject:\n\nSteve:\nHere's a substantially more cleaned-version, with attachments.

Based on our conversation,\nthis email includes the following:\n\nAn Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan\nds.\n\nOur views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h\now\nto remove those impediments.\n\nA description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR,s ability\n to\nsign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two\npossible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC\norder clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through\nrates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I\nhave attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose\nd\namendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable\noption.\n\nOur assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.\n\nOur suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-\nand long-term electricity crisis in California.

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n\nExcessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\n\nSolution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took\n a\nstep in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been\ndesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract\nmonopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t\nhe\nelimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than\n1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for\nCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc\ne\nthe risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by\noffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o\nf\ndistributed generation.\n\nExcessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with\ninvestor-owned and municipal utilities\n\nSolution:   The Governor,s executive order regarding interconnection is \na\nstep in the right direction*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete\ninterconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this\nrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed\ngeneration.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when\ninterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome\nthrough executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent\npossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th\ne\nutility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be\naccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\nDevelopers of distributed (i.e., \"on-site\") generation that is 50 MWs\n or\ngreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an\nd\ntherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale\ngeneration faces. \n\nSolution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru\nD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant\noutput apply equally to smaller scale, \"distributed generation\" facil\nities.\nIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to\nface local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial\ninterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects\n. \nThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n\n3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase\nElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities\n\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with\nsuppliers.\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th\ne\ngoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\nWe understand that the lion,s share of counterparties share Enron,s c\nredit\nrisk concerns.\nEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and\nis working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to\nboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements\ngoing forward.\n\nSummary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\nThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to\ncharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our\nanalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the\nCalifornia PUC,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  \nAs\nsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat\nes\nadequate charges to cover DWR,s costs of power purchases.\n\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract \"Prudence\"\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public\nUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are\n\"imprudent.\"  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref\nuse to\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr\nee\nto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\n\nAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to\nRecover DWR,s Costs of Power Purchases\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to\nthe specific ratemaking \"mechanics\" that AB1X directs the PUC to empl\noy to\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i\ns\nextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu\nre\nDWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it \nis\ndifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in\nrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR,s power purchase\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since\nsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover\nfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk\n\nWe have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri\nsk\nissues.  We have identified three options:\n\nAmend AB1X\nThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the\nPUC would accept as \"prudent and reasonable\" all purchase costs incur\nred by\nDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary \nto\nensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the\npreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political\nchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file\nentitled, \"AmendAB1X.doc\".)\n\nClarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and\nthrough Contract Language\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo\nre\ntime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,\n\"cpuctalkingpoints.doc.\")\n\nMake Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\nAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR's RFP, we are willing to ac\ncept\nother forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,\ncash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have\nindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR\nprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through\ncontract amendments.\n\n4. California's Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n\nBoth the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research\nAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports\nshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe\nr\nonly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al\nl\ncredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer\nof 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are\nlikely. \n\nCEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this\nsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our\nestimates.  California's supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,\n well\nbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio\nn\nin the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power\nthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the\nunpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t\no\ndate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t\nhe\nflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. \nCalifornia's very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to \nthis\nrequirement. \n\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early\ndraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve\nre\nsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced\nnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the\nutilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren\nt\npace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be\nadded to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n\nCERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of\nrolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more\noptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California\nshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\n\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California\n's\nElectricity Crisis\n\nThis email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil\nl\ndeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing\nbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n\nAs we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\n\nIncrease supply\nDecrease demand\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\nReturn California's Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n\nIncrease supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. \nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n\nThe Governor's executive orders and Senator Sher's siting reform legi\nslation\nare steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho\nse\nefforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face\nin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit\nrequirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron's\nproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)\ntransfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an\ninnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund\nemissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a\nir\ndistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the\nrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\n\nDecrease demand*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\nBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing\nthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the\nbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo\nst\neffectively and quickly in two ways:\n\nBuy-down demand\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun\nd\nto finance DWR's power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand\n more\neconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou\nld\nbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,\nthrough the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to\ndetermine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To\nparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment\nnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the\nreductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, \"D\neal\nBench,\" that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\n\nUse Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\nTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n\nAn internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price\nfor hour-ahead power in real time.\nReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment\nverification.\nSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be\npaid for load reduction (\"Negawatts\").\n\nThe potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ\ne:\n\n\"creation\" of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti\ncularly\nin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation\nresources.\nreduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California\nelectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity \nin\nthe state.\nfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris\nk\nof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to\ncustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for\nresponding.\n\nWe estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in\nexcess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for\nsummer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate\nthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time\ns\nthat amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates\ndirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and\ncontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\n\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market*Legislative vehi\ncle:\nSB27X\nThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we\nre\ncustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy\nservice providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from\ncustomers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th\ne\nprohibition against Direct Access.\n\nEnron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a\ndirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o\nf\nWater Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from\ncustomer migration. \n\nIn addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when\nthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme\nnt\nis not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial\ncondition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should\ntherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement\nfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a\nnon-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, California\nshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period \nin\nwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments\nof utility load.\n\nReturn California's Investor-owned utilities to solvency*Legislative \nvehicle:\nAB18X\nUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand. \nIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California's supply-demand\nimbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers\nand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California\nState government assume the role of \"electricity buyer\" for an extended\nperiod of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence\nin California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to\nparticipate in that market.\n\nCalifornia can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a\nseries of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate\nincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without\n\"shocking\" the economy or household budgets For example, California could\namortize the recovery of the utilities, past debt over a 5-10 year period. \nIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:\nFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in\nrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of \nAB\n1890.  Second, California can \"net\" the revenues the utilities have r\neceived\nfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav\ne\naccrued due to the retail price cap.\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "175841", "class": "email"}

These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the \"Review Team\" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the \"Resource Group\" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:\n\n<http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp>\n\nIf you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extension 3-1939. \n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "21257", "class": "email"}

Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do\n     sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal\n     government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier'\n     contractor.  (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I\n     have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him\n     today.)  Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to\n     abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors.\n\n     Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare\n     affirmative action plans.  In addition, we do not feel that we are\n     subject to an OFCCP audit.\n\n     Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not\n     included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's\n     status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1\n     and AAPs.\n\n     Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any\n     of this.\n\n     Hoyt\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "230685", "class": "email"}

I am not optimistic primarily because this is handled out of Chennai, as it must since the parents are residents of Andhra Pradesh. Our earlier requests for visas from Chennai have been a very mixed bag, with us being turned down more often than not. The fact of the matter is that the visa officers in the respective consulates have incredible amounts of discretion and ability to say no. Once they say no, it is very difficult to reverse.\n\nBut I will go through our good contacts at the US Consulate in Mumbai, as this has had more success than us speaking directly to Chennai. \n\nWade\n\nFrom:\tVince J.

You probably remember Krishna\nfrom his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.\n\nA brief outline of the facts.\n\n1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years\nago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival\nwas a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy\nis also very complicated.\n\n2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a \ntourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the\nterm of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with\nthe US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.\n\nThe company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an \noutstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American \nsociety. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his \nbehalf to the State Department.\n\nI would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational\napproach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.\n\nI hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's\nbehalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. \nI shall fax to you a copy of the decision.\n\nThanks.\n\nVince\n\n << File: Krishna's Letter.DOC >> \n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "54536", "class": "email"}

Adam Caldwell.\n\nGood day and compliments, I know this letter will definitely come to you as a huge surprise, but I implore you to take\nyour time to go through it carefully as the decision you make will go off a long way to determine my future and\ncontinued existence.\n\nPlease allow me to introduce myself. I am Sgt. Adam Caldwell, a US Marine Sgt.serving in the 3rd Battalion, 25th Marine\nRegiment that Patrols the An bar province, Iraq. I am desperately in need of assistance and I have summoned up courage\nto contact you. I am presently in Iraq and I found your contact particulars in an address journal.\n\nI am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of Nine Hundred Thousand US Dollars (Nine Hundred thousand USD) in cash\nto the States or any safe country; as far as I can be assured that it will be safe in your care until I complete my\nservice here in Iraq. This is not stolen money and there are no Dangers involved.\n\nSOURCE OF MONEY:\n\nSome money in various currencies was discovered and concealed in barrels with piles of weapons and ammunition at a\nlocation near one of Saddam Hussein's old Presidential Palaces during a rescue operation and it was agreed by all party\npresent that the money will be shared among us.\n\nClick this link http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2988455.stm.\n\nThis might appear as an illegal thing to do but I tell you what.\n\nNo compensation can make up for the risks we have taken with our lives in this hellhole. The above figure was given to\nme as my share and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a British contact working\nwith the UN here (his office enjoys some immunity)I was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of\ntrouble spot.\n\nHe does not know the real contents of the package as he believes that it belongs to an American who died in an air raid,\nwho before giving up trusted me to hand over the package to his close relative. I have now found a secured way of\ngetting the package out of Iraq for you to pick it up.\n\nI do not know for how long I will remain here, as I have been lucky to survive 2 suicide bomb attacks by Pure Divine\nintervention.\n\nThis and other reasons put into consideration have prompted me to reach out for help. If it might be of interest to you\nthen Endeavor to contact me and we would work out the necessary formalities, but I pray that you are discreet about this\nmutually benefiting relationship.\n\nRespectfully,\nSgt. Adam Caldwell,\nUnited States Marine Corps. IRAQ.\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "111348", "class": "email"}

The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of\naccount; a store of value; and, occasionally, a standard of deferred payment. Money originated as commodity money, but\nnearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money. Fiat money is without intrinsic use value as a physical\ncommodity, and derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a\nform of payment within the boundaries of the country, for \"all debts, public and private\". \n\n The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and demand deposits or 'bank money' (the\nbalance held in checking accounts and savings accounts). These demand deposits usually account for a much larger part of\nthe money supply than currency. Bank money is intangible and exists only in the form of various bank records. Despite\nbeing intangible, bank money still performs the basic functions of money, being generally accepted as a form of payment.\n\n\n The word \"money\" is believed to originate from a temple of Hera, located on Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills.\nIn the ancient world Hera was often associated with money. The temple of Juno Moneta at Rome was the place where the\nmint of Ancient Rome was located. The name \"Juno\" may derive from the Etruscan goddess Uni (which means \"the one\",\n\"unique\", \"unit\", \"union\", \"united\") and \"Moneta\" either from the Latin word \"monere\" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the\nGreek word \"moneres\" (alone, unique). In the Western world, a prevalent term for coin-money has been specie, stemming\nfrom Latin in specie, meaning 'in kind'.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "111359", "class": "email"}

Though I am very rich, I was never\ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my self as that was the only thing I Cared for.

Now that I know My time is near I have been touched by God to donate from what I have Inherited from my late\nhusband for the good work of God, rather than Allow my relatives to use my husband hard earned funds ungodly.\n\nSo far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, London and Ireland. Now that my health has\ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to Close one of my accounts\nand donate the money, which I have there to Charity organization in Bulgaria; they refused and kept the money to\nthemselves hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

I\ndecided to WILL/donate the money to you for the good work of the lord, And also to help the motherless and less\nprivilege and also for the Assistance of the widows according to (JAMES 1:27).\n\nI took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit This money and my husband relatives are not\ninclined to helping poor Persons and I do not want my husband's hard earned money to be misused Or spent in the\nmanner in which my late husband did not specify. At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the\nFact that my relatives are around my health status and me. I wish you all the best and May the good Lord bless you\nabundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others.\n\nNB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the task is accomplished, as I don't want\nanything that will jeopardize my last wish.

It all depends on our trusting each\n other but I've chosen to contact you prayerfully and believing that you are the person to help me. I am Mr.Godfred\n Nana, 30yrs of age; I became an orphan some couple of years ago. The source of my parent's death was believed\n to be from our detractors who are never happy that my Father was making so much progress. The issue is that my parents\n are diamond merchants in my country Liberia and they made too much money from the business that prompted the government\n of Liberia to probe them.\n\n So during the crisis in Liberia our home was among the first target by the Liberian rebels. They allegedly said that,\n my late parents have a close relationship with former president of Liberia (Charles Taylor) that was their reason of\n storming our home. My mother died immediately they storm our resident and my father sustained serious bruises that he\n could not survive while in the hospital. I and my younger sister managed to escape during the incident. As i am talking\n to you now, i and my younger sister are staying in Ghana for some obvious reasons that i will like to relay to you on\n your response to this message.\n\n This is a confidential matter i will like to discuss with someone whom my spirits accepted to deal with. Because after\n my parents exit, the government of Liberia have taken over all of our belongings. They have also emptied my parents\n bank accounts left alone with a deposit my father made in a nearby country called Ghana during his trade to Ghana. No\n one knows of this deposit, it is only me as the next of kin and my father had earlier warned me not to disclose this\n issue to anyone before he died in the hospital after the incident that cause his death. Today I and my younger sister\n find for ourselves in Ghana.\n\n And life has been very difficult since the government of Ghana started their deportation exercise which says that we\n refugees should evacuate their Bujumbura refugee camp to our various countries. Please my dear beloved, our plans now\n are to relocate from Ghana since we can not afford to go back to Liberia following our past experience as they killed\n our parents, but we will need to move out the fund left by my late father here in Ghana. Meanwhile, my father left an\n order with the depositary that without me, presenting a foreign partner that the company should not mind me. He made\n such an agreement with them following the economic and political crisis in Africa. And any attempt for me to try and\n move this fund alone in my name will cause me more problems than I can imagine as an African young boy, as the\n government may bent on taking this money from me and my sister.\n\n Once you agree to help us move this fund, we will link you up with our late father's lawyer who endorsed his signatures\n during the day my father was depositing the fund so that he can brief you more better. As soon as we agree, we will\n come to your country where I and my sister will invest the money under your guide. The main reason of contacting you is\n to solicit your help in coming forward to help us claim the fund as my late father instructed and after that we will\n move the Money to your Country for an investment. I have all the documents of the deposit given to me by my late father\n and also the lawyer will help us get all necessary documents that will enable you receive this boxes on our behalf in\n your country for us to come over in your country for investment. So please let me know what will be your compensation\n for helping me and my sister out?\n\n Please NOTE that the earlier you help me the better as you will be doing God a great favor because our lives are no\n more safe with these people over here. I will need your reply stating your readiness to help in seeing this through. I\n will give our lawyer your contact when I hear from you with your contact info, so we can discuss further arrangement on\n this transaction.I wait for your favorable reply.\n\n Thanks and be bless,\n Godfred Nana and his Younger Sister\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "111400", "class": "email"}

I need you to make out time to read this mail attentively in order\nto understand the reason I am sending you this mail.\n\nI am Lawson, 20 years of age, the only child of my parents, Mr and Mrs Ernest Stanley, My parents were Natives of Ivory\nCoast before they migrated to the United States when I was just 4 year old. We lived at No 215 West Wieuca Road\nNortheast Atlanta, Georgia USA and I attended the famous Frederick Douglass High School northwest Atlanta, Georgia USA,\nbut when my mother fell sick and died June 2001, My father became weak every day and later he fall sick, I believe it\nwas the shock of my mum's sudden death that deteriorated his health.. He got retired from his office, Fidelity National\nInsurance Company at No 200 Galleria Parkway Southeast Atlanta GA 30339 USA October 2004, from there we moved to New\nYork City because of my dad medication.\n\nThen December 2005 my father called me and told that he doesn't want to die in a foreign land. That he has made enough\nmoney, that he felt the best thing for him to do now is for us to relocate back to his home country of COTE D'lVOIRE so\nthat he can set up his own Insurance company and give job opportunities to his people and he also told me that he want\nme to learn about his people and their culture. On the 14 of December 2005 we returned back to COTE D'lVOIRE.\n\nThen after some time my dad started to look for properties to buy to use for an office, in several occasions I went out\nwith him to inspect some properties. But unfortunately on the 22nd of February 2006 my father collapsed and later died.\n\nWhy am telling you all this because now my life in danger and well know that your stranger which you can help me out!!!\nThe reason I am telling you and revealing to you my family's secret because my late dad's burial is over and my Uncle is\nsearching every where looking for bank documents that my father used in depositing all his money in the bank when his\nsickness became serious..\n\nBut he doesn't know that I have hide the documents in a safe place outside the house where he can not find them based on\nmy late father's advice on his sick bed before his death. This secret has been in my mind for close to a years now and I\ndon't even know who to tell because I need someone to help me receive this money in a foreign account to enable me leave\nhere peacefully. This is the reason I make contact with you to help me received the money. That mean you will provide an\naccount where the money will be transfer into then I will take the next available flight to join you once you confirm to\nme that you have received the money in your account.. I have thought about it and I came to the conclusion that this is\nthe only way I can get the money transfer out of here without my uncle knowing about it.\n\nIf you have the fear of God Almighty and believe that you can help me please respond to this mail include with your\ndirect telephone number and also try to call me for more details.\n\nI want you to know that I passed by so many people and many profile before I came in contact with your contact info and\nwhen I did, my heart and the spirit of God dwelling inside me asked me to confide and trust you.\n\nPlease get back to me ASAP, Reply to this email\n\nGod bless you as I look forward in meeting you soon!!!\n\nThanks,\n\nLawson Stanley.\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "114423", "class": "email"}

Some providers have or will be informing their clients, but others could simply be\nincreasing fees slowly over time. The bottom line is, it would be wise to get competitive bids from multiple credit card\nprocessing companies sooner rather than later. Many merchants are overpaying for credit card processing fees by up to\n30%, and don't even know it. Could this be you?\n\nGo to: http://www.mysasan.info/bb/ to have multiple credit card processing\ncompanies bid for your business today. Only the lowest bidding vendor and the vendors that you select will receive your\ninformation, so you won't be inundated with solicitations.\n\nThat's right! You can now get competitive bids\nfrom multiple credit card processing companies at once. Compare these rates against your current provider and see what\nyou could be saving, or at the very least verify that your current rate is competitive. Odds are, you can cut your\nprocessing fees substantially and improve your bottom line immediately. We estimate that at least 80% of merchants are\nsignificantly over paying for credit card processing. \n\nGo to: http://www.mysasan.info/bb/ to have multiple credit card processing companies\ncompete for your business today.\n                               \n Thank you,\n BBI Services\n 3183 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 196\n Los Angeles, CA. 90010                                                       \n 702-628-8640\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "114442", "class": "email"}

They have managed to cut through all the hype and\ncontroversy that surrounds menopause in their latest book - a virtual\nmakeover and guide that helps make the smoothest transition through this\nvery natural occurrence in a woman\u2019s life.  Please read the following\npress release and let me know if you are interested in receiving a copy of\ntheir book for consideration of an engaging interview, or to provide a\nreview.  Thank you.\n\nMonica Foster\nAscot Media Group, Inc.\nPost Office Box 133032\nThe Woodlands, TX 77393\nmfoster@ascotmediagroup.com\nOffice: (281) 324-2180\nDirect: (713) 446-8815\nwww.ascotmediagroup.com\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nTwo dedicated doctors did their part to make sixty the new forty for all\nwomen - thanks to their virtual makeover\n\nLaPorte, IN, February 21, 2011 - Even in our modern world, \u2018menopause\u2019\nstill bears a stigma and people still speak about it softly for fear that\nit might be contagious.  Truth is, every woman has to go through it; there\nis no way to avoid it - so why not get the best possible information to\nhelp in the transition?  Doctors David C. Miller and Lovera Wolf Miller\nunderstand this and it is a primary reason they wrote Womenopause: Stop\nPausing and Start Living (O-Books) \u2013 an exceptional book that acts as an\ninformative yet compassionate guide through menopause.\n\nEven the most self-assured woman anticipates this very natural occurrence\nwith dread, conjuring up visions of decline and even associating it with\nlosing their looks \u2013 or worse, possibly even their husbands!  \nWomenopause was written to help the over six thousand women reaching\nmenopause in America every single day, and Drs. David and Lovera Miller\nrecognize that there is a real need for help on this sensitive subject that\nencompasses more than half of a woman\u2019s lifetime between peri-menopause\nand post-menopause.\n\nWomenopause is a breath of fresh air to many women because it offers real\nsolutions on everything from hormones and hot flashes, brain and bone\npreservation, breast health, skin, fitness, food, sleep, to intimacy and\nmore.  In other words, it is packed with thirty years of proven success\nrather than a swing in trends that has become \u2018the cure du jour!\u2019\n\nThe superior credentials of both doctors authenticate how they have devoted\ntheir lives to helping menopausal women.  Dr. Lovera is a board certified\nobstetrician and gynecologist, a Fellow of the American College of\nObstetrics & Gynecology, and a certified menopause practitioner.  Dr. David\nMiller is boarded in pain and anesthesiology, taught neuroanatomy at UCLA,\nwas an instructor of courses in physiology and neurophysiology, and is also\na certified menopause practitioner.

Parish, M.D Professor of Medicine, Albert Einstein School of\nMedicine: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s a fabulous book. Womenopause is a very well-rounded,\ncomprehensive compendium on the female transition commonly termed menopause.\n\u2026offer a refreshing look at a natural process that affects every aspect of\nthe midlife woman\u2019s health and well-being. They challenge standard social\nconcepts of menopause as well as provide a new paradigm that focuses on\nvitality and wellness. The book offers a clear and understandable, yet\nthorough and scientifically sound explanation of the physiology of\nmenopause and the anticipated physical, psychological and mental changes.\nThe authors offer a well-balanced view of available remedies for symptoms\nincluding hormonal, non-hormonal-pharmaceutical, and alternative\ntreatments. Also, they nicely discuss behavioral and lifestyle approaches.\nThis book is a tremendous resource for any woman seeking to employ an\nintelligent and multifaceted approach to the Womenopause transition.\u201d\n\nWatch the authors Dr. David Miller and Dr. Lovera Miller recently appearing\non CBS Los Angeles: Pop Up Video \n\n\n\n\nClick Here to Unsubscribe\nhttp://www.ascotmedianews.com/em12all/box.php?nl=227&c=1383&m=66&s=4345d6ab29f61487f38545fdded3dede&funcml=unsub2\n: Sender information: Ascot Media Group Inc., Post Office Box 133032, The\nWoodlands, TX  77393.  281-333-3507\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "114448", "class": "email"}

But it\u2019s not just his reading and writing skills\nthat make him a well-known figure; it\u2019s his brain-based learning strategies that\nmake it possible to comprehend and retain the information. Since his strategies\ncan be learned by anyone, the possibilities are mind-boggling!\n\n\u2028\u2028Berg once completed a 1,100 page book on Cleveland\u2019s Morning Exchange and\nachieved a perfect score on recall \u2013 what makes it truly astounding is that he\nwas retested three years later on the same book and again had perfect recall. As\na guest on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, he memorized a 200-page book, reading\nat the rate of 13-14 pages/minute, and scored 100% accuracy on an extensive test\ngiven by the author.\u2028\u2028\n\nBerg has created more than fourteen other accelerated learning programs\nthat include speed math and memory. His Time-Warner book Super Reading Secrets\nis in its 28th reprint and his Nightingale-Conant program, Mega Speed Reading,\ngrossed over $65,000,000 and earned him recognition as a leading expert on\nbrain-based learning. He has been honored by both Who\u2019s Who Among Emerging\nLeaders and 2,000 Notable American Men; two leading books that track outstanding\nprofessional performance.\u2028\u2028\n\nKnown as the world\u2019s fastest reader, Berg\u2019s talents are attributed to the\ncutting-edge, accelerated learning techniques he developed that turn information\noverload into information assets. His methods have not only enabled the\nunemployed to get back to work sooner by teaching them additional skills that\nmake them more marketable, but by continuing to apply these skills they will\nstay on top of the information their success depends upon! He makes life easier\nby cutting learning time in half \u2013 giving everyone the opportunity to succeed\nbut with more time left for the things they enjoy.\n\n\u2028\u2028Howard Berg is an entertaining celebrity who has appeared on over one\nthousand radio and television programs including Neil Cavuto and Jon Stewart,\nand is the spokesperson for the Sony E-Reader along with Justin Timberlake,\nPeyton Manning and Amy Sedaris.\u2028\u2028\n\nHe \u2018walked the talk\u2019 by completing a four-year psychology program in one year\nusing his brain-based learning techniques, leading the way for many others to\nfollow as evidenced by the testimonials on his website at:\nwww.howiereadingtip.com.\n\n\u2028\u2028###\u2028\u2028\n\nTIP SHEET:\n\n\u2028\u2028Results from student, Stephen Terry, using Howard Berg\u2019s learning techniques:\nAmazingly, at age sixteen Stephen graduated University of Texas at Arlington\nwith a 4.0 GPA while majoring in Economics!

(If users dink with the message headers themselves,\nall bets are off.)\n\n> Should the Pine developers remove this feature?\n\nI'm not sure what the feature in question is, but if it's\nsomething which lets users specify the value to be sent out as the\nMIME Content-Type: charset, I think it's a bad idea, and should be\nremoved or significantly altered.\n\nAn easy mistake to make (I speak from experience) is to assume\nthat the charset parameter on a MIME Content-Type: line encodes\nthe character set used by the entity composing the message, or\nthe character set to be used by the entity displaying the\nmessage. I find that the best way to think about charset is that\nit is *neither*.  charset is an octet-based encoding used during\nmessage transfer; it need bear no relation to the composing or\nviewing character sets.  In the most general case, a message will\nbe composed using some native character set, translated\nautomatically to a MIME-registered charset, and translated at the\nother end into a native display character set.  It should be more\nlikely that the charset value be selected by an automaton, not by\na human.\n\n(If anyone finds the above paragraph startling, you're welcome to\nwrite to me for clarification.  I'm not going to prolong this\nmessage with additional explanations right now.)\n\nIt's not necessarily *wrong* to think of charset as having\nsomething to do with the composing or viewing character set (in\nmany cases, not coincidentally, all three will be identical), but\nit is very easy to make conceptual mistakes, implement\nnonconformant software, or just generally misunderstand how MIME\nis supposed to work if you don't explicitly separate in your mind\nthe concepts of composing/viewing character sets and transmission\ncharsets.  (You'll notice that I reinforce this distinction in my\nown head and in this message by using the terms \"character set\"\nand \"charset\" noninterchangeably.)\n\nThe charset situation is much like the canonical CRLF situation:\nthe fact that the canonical representation is identical to some\nbut not all of the available local representations guarantees\nmisunderstandings.\n\nTo be sure, automated selection of and translation to a registered\nMIME charset is a non-trivial task, and mailers which are trying\nto adopt MIME right away cannot be faulted for deferring\ndevelopment of such functionality for a while.  However, just\nletting users specify non-default, non-7-bit-US-ASCII, (non-MIME)\ncharsets is an open invitation to misunderstanding and\nnoninteroperability.\n\nFor now, composition agents which wish to allow users to use\nextended character sets (such as Latin-1), but which elect to\nrelegate character set and/or charset selection to the user,\nshould either present the user with a menu of registered MIME\ncharsets from which to select (presumably it will be up to the\nuser to ensure that the editor or composition tool is actually\nusing a character set corresponding to the selected charset), or\n(in the case of what it sounds like PINE is doing) at least filter\nthe user's open-ended charset selection against the list of\nregistered values (and perhaps also the X- pattern).\n\nI've copied this message to the IETF character sets mailing list\n(ietf-charsets@innosoft.com, subscription requests to\nietf-charsets-request@innosoft.com); any followup traffic should\nbe sent there, and *not* to the ietf-822 list.\n\n                                        Steve Summit\n                                        scs@adam.mit.edu\n\nP.S. to pine-info@cac.washington.edu: despite my e-mail address,\nI'm actually in Seattle, near UW.

For example if you set Pine to use ISO-8859-1 and send an\nall ASCII message it will tag it US-ASCII (instead of ISO-8859-1).  Also,\nit's smart enough to display the lower 128 for all incoming messages in\nthe ISO-8859-X characters sets and greek the ones it can't if the\ncharacter set of the receiving Pine is US-ASCII or ISO-8859-X.

I maintain that CHARSET specification should be\nomitted when feasible.   This is because there are such things as\ngateways which translate the SMTP octet-stream into anything.\n\n        There are two goals:  1)  to be able to specify new and/or\nextended character sets  (and mark-ups and other extensions to plain text)\nand  2)  to use  \"plain text\"  (in mail)  as a transport medium.\nFor the former,  use  Base64  encoding when needed.   For the latter,\ndon't label the text  \"ASCII\"  or any other codepoint mapping if there's\nany way on earth that it might get translated by a gateway.\n\n        I don't think this is making sense and I can't find the words.\nSteve apparently has:   charset -vs- character_set.\n\n        Plain text  is defined differently from system to system.\nOn UNIX,  plain text is ASCII (now ISO-8859-1) with lines delimited by\nNL (actually LF).

And this thinking,  carried into MIME  (thus this\nshould be kicked BACK TO the IETF-822 list,  but I refrain),  shows up\nin the use of  CHARSET=ISO-8859-1  rather than  CHARACTER_SET=Latin-1.\nIf you specify  \"Latin-1\",  then you can  (must;  I'm arguing for a\ndefinition here,  not an explanation)  assume that  SMTP  will carry it\nas ISO-8859-1,  BUT THE RECEIVING  (or sending)  HOST MIGHT NOT.\n(and yes,  sad but true,  any SMTPs will strip the high bit)\n\n>To be sure, automated selection of and translation to a registered\n>MIME charset is a non-trivial task,   ...\n\n        Yes.

That's why I ask that\n(today,  1993)  we  NOT LABEL  true plain text as  US-ASCII/ISO-8859-1.\nJust leave it alone and let it default at the receiving end.\n\n>                                    and mailers which are trying\n>to adopt MIME right away cannot be faulted for deferring\n>development of such functionality for a while.\n\n        And let me reiterate that I'm not mad at the Pine developers\n(nor the MIME developers;  not mad at anyone,  just trying to push a\npoint that I think is important and has been missed).

This is especially a problem as information services are\nprovided for clients on various difference hardware architectures.\n\nCurrently, for the Western European languages at least 5 different encodings\nare in use on the network: ISO-7 National Variants, ISO 8859/1, ROMAN8, T.61,\nand RC850. (See RFC1345 for further information on these character sets.) If we\nconsider the other scripts used in Europe and the other encodings the number of\ndifferent charater set codes rise to as many as 40. This is the real (and\nmessy) world we live in.  Changing the character sets in this world is not an\noption, as current systems run applications which can support only the\ncharacter sets used by that system.\n\nHowever, a universal encoding has begun to appear: UCS (ISO 10646). Initial\nexperience with this solution has been positive. However, there are still\nmany issued to be addressed in the context of ISO 10 646 and the other\ncharacter set codes, which will exist on the Internet in the future:\n\n\n(1) Can we agree on some common network services/model for character set\n   handling?\n\n(2) Should a general-purpose SW tool be designed that will support both\n    UCS and regional character sets?\n\n(3) Is there a solution that will make character set convertors for diffrent\n    codes \"plug-and-play\" (i.e. an API) without specifying the actual\n    underlying implementation? Can we use UCS as a common denominator for that?\n\n(4) Is it necessary to have a document identifying the language and the\n    character sets which cater for particular language?\n\n(5) If we need to solve these problems and UCS (ISO 10 646)  is the\n    only available general option today which is maybe close to be\n    sufficient,  can we  start with UCS and make minimal\n    changes or specifications which will be sufficient for our needs. Can we\n    discuss the missing agreement/specifiactions  required in the\n    communication protocols such as:\n\n(5.1) The order of octets in the interchange of data is left to be specified\n    by the sender and the recipient in UCS.  What are the \"sender\" and\n    \"recipient\"      on the Internet? Can we define a mechanism to\n    identify the serialized     byte order of a data stream?\n\n(5.2) Additional encoding mechanisms for the UCS have been proposed.  Do these\n    schemes have any merit?\n\n(5.3) Some amount of profiling may be necessary for UCS use in some countries,\n      do we need to specify that globally or we can leave it to particular\n      region to be solved as regional matter?\n\n(5.4) Do we need to differentiate or specify how tagged data (i.e the field typ\ne\n    in a data base)and how \"serialized byte order\" data are treated in a\n    communication protocol or will some common specification for the tag and\n    the type be sufficient?\n\n\nThe goal of the BOF is to test the interest for the various issues.\nIf possible a clear set of issues could be identified then WG(s)\nwill be defined.\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "lists-003-2173878", "class": "email"}

It is just terse. The ideas are\nbased on experience. They have been put to use in the field of 8-bit\ncharacters. I participated to the design of Kermit multinational 8-bit\ncharacters support and the TCP/IP network I work for is well on the way\ntowards the the same theory that every character on the communication\nline is ISO 8859-1. Any exception to this, like translating EBCDIC directly\nto PC code on one machine, is considered harmful to our internetworking,\neven if convenient.\nEvery piece working towards a common well defined goal finally pays more\nwhen all parts start to clutch than wandering for immediate interest.\nAnd I hope that saying that my language is French will make the ideas\nin a difficult to write text even more convincing, despite being short.\n\nNetworking has had for long the problem of a common representation of\ncomputer-specific data (numbers, bit strings...) on the wire (rather, on the\nconnection), because different computers had different conventions for them.\nTo solve this problem, rules like XDR (external data representation) have\nbeen devised, and, because it was so important, the rules have been adopted.\n\nCharacter data caused little problem because ASCII was assumed, full stop.\nThere was hardly an expressed rule. It was tacit computer culture.\n\nNow that networking reaches its real dimension of an international mesh,\nthe problem of national languages usage becomes very real, at least locally,\nbut more and more internationally. Any computer has to exchange more\nthan ASCII.\nMany generous people have spent much time to have system Si with character\ncode Ci translate data for system Sj with code Cj under protocol Pk.\nWith much respect for their work, this is not (no longer) the way to do it.\nSupposing that N character codes exist on different systems, the effort\namounts to M*N**2 to reach a complete solution. Let us count the different\ncharacter codes (IBM have their share) and protocols, the bill is amazing!\n\nThe _most_important_point_ is that a single common representation code\nbe defined _for_the_line_ (suiting the purpose, namely to cover all national\nlanguages in one single way) and that people be instructed that every bit\nof text should travel in that code on the wire, whatever_the_protocol_is.\n(Meaning that common tools be available to translate present local code).\nIt is best for a computer to use the code of interchange internally,\nbut all computers in the world cannot be modified overnight.\nWhat computer Si has to do to abide by the external representation is\nthe sole matter of computer Si: to appear to others as if it were using\nit internally. On any protocol the same way, even during dialog with\ncomputer Ti using the same code (\"One need not know which kind of system\none is sending mail to\"). No tagging of the data nor any need to know\nany character code other than one's own and the interchange code.\nThe M*N**2 order of magnitude reduces to N.\nThis is the extended \"ASCII culture\" of some future, no doubt.\nIt is a very important goal just now.\nIt is a fact that the choice of a character code has long lasting effects,\nbecause of the building software base. The impact of today's decisions\nis amplified by time. The sooner the better. The better the sooner.\n\nMore theoretically said this time, this local-code to exchange-code\ntranslation works much a la OSI layer (or \"a` la\", if you don't mind :-)\nData is encoded towards a lower layer, exchanged, and decoded back to\nsame level, but possibly to a different local code.\nIt probably belongs between level 6 and 7, as it could prove that the\napplication layer provides all the textual data. But that's not sure,\nlike for XDR which can be used from many levels to convert CPU data\nto line format.\nShould we merge \"presentation\" and \"representation\" layers, split level 6\nlike level 2 or not assign it to any level, I'll leave the discussion to\nthe theoricians.\n\nWhat seems clear in my mind is that the translation is not in several\nfinal protocols, but a protocol by itself -- like XDR -- that other\nprotocols refer to.\nAnd this may be the most important point.\nIt is a pity to see each protocol tackle the problem its own way.\n\nNote that the \"level 6 or so\" concept applied to text extends slightly beyond\nthe representation of characters (and binary data) towards file structure.\nThink of the line separator problem of NFS for the basic case of text files.\nWhile file structure (including file name etc...) is clearly a specialized\nproblem (as opposed to communication of streams of text), the impact on\nsystems and protocols design is just as high.\n\nClearly, it will take much time to stand in ASCII's shoes.\nBut doing otherwise would take even longer to erase and redo.\nOne cannot increase complication eternally.\n\nSome intermediate compromises will have to be used like additional\nencoding on pathes some insist to not even try to convert to 8-bit,\nasking the rest of the networks to convert to 7-bit instead and to\nrewrite all their programs to use a complicated method for sending\nplain text when the sole problem is that it contains 8-bit data.\n\nThe important thing is that the new layer be known and used.\nIt's the interest of both the software writer and buyer.\nIt will get void when a system will use the interchange code for itself.\n\nNow that the international character code ISO 10646 is out, isn't it time\nfor communication systems to be able to not only exchange pictures and sound\nbut also plain text?  Will ISO 10646 be used by OSI 6?\n\nThanks for your interest.\nI go away for holidays today.

Dave will attempt to\nkeep Nico in the loop via email on the mailing list and separate phone calls.\n\n\nAdding further People to the Math-ERB\n\nStu Weibel of OCLC sends his regrets that they are too busy to accept the\ninvitation at this time. Elsevier have contacted the AMS. Ralph Youngen,\nAssociate Director, Electronic Product Development for AMS has accepted the\ninvitation to join the group, along with a couple of his colleagues.\n\nThe need for full SGML?\n\nWe discussed whether it was necessary to use SGML for the math notation.\nBasically, we have a preference for an extensible operator precedence\nnotation. This can be included in HTML documents and handled correctly by\nSGML processing applications via the NOTATION mechanism.\n\nWhen using operator precedence, there is a need to constrain the context in\nwhich given operators can be used. Niel said this wasn't as simple as at\nfirst it might appear. Dave will work on a formal mechanism for this.\n\nIt is also unclear as to when macro processing is applied. Further discussion\non this is needed. It should be practical for parsers to deal with missing\narguments sensibly. This in general depends on the context.\n\nRaman voiced a concern on Bruce's comment on 2D pictures. We agreed however,\nthat a fixed set of \"layout\" idioms are sufficient for HTML-math. Raman\npromised to propose some new wording. He also gave us a URL for his test\nsuite, which I have added to the math-erb home page.\n\nWe ended by discussing some of the parsing issues for mismatched brackets and\nnumber literals. It seems clear that bracket matching can't in general be\nrequired. Authors should be able to control the settings for this and for\nliterals.\n\nDave has posted a dump of his understanding as a result of this conference\ncall.

V.)\nCc: w3c-math-erb@w3.org\n\n\n\n     \n   \nI've read the minutes of the last few meetings and Dave's\nproposal. Here are some comments.\n\n1. If you want to have a model for large or extendible characters,\nI would like to suggest that we consider (again) the model of TeX\nand the Computer Modern fonts. Barbara Beeton of the AMS has also\ndone interesting work on math font layout in some ISO workgroup.\n\n2. Automatic numbering, or better: automatic generation of numbers\n(labels) from keys used in symbolic referencing, a la \\label/\\ref\nin LaTeX or ID/IDREF in SGML, is fraught with difficulties.\nBetween =-=-=-= lines I'll include a piece I wrote about that in\nrelation to the Elsevier Science DTD's.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nThe problem of symbolic referencing has never been one of the DTDs,\nbut one of finding an algorithm for deriving (printed) numbers/labels\nfrom symbolic labels in the SGML source document.\n\n\nEarlier summary of the problem\n------------------------------\nA generic mechanism for counters, including some rules for\npresentation of counters, is as follows.\n\n- Every type of numbered object, table, figure, equation,\n  reference, has its own counter.\n- All top-level counters start at the value 0 (zero) at the\n  beginning of the document.\n- If nesting is possible, every nesting level has its own counter.\n- Counters of levels below top-level start at the value 0 (zero) at the\n  start tag of the next higher (parent) level.\n- From the values of the counter(s) a label is calculated. This\n  label is e.g. printed in the article as it appears in a journal\n  issue. The relation between labels and counters is\n  application-dependent.\n  Example: |<sec id=\"99\">| could be printed as ``3.2.1''.\n- The values of the |id| attributes are unique within the\n  document instance.\n- The |id| attribute is not identical to the counter value.\n- If the |id| attribute is missing, the counter is not\n  incremented, and the element is not numbered. This allows for e.g.\n  un-numbered equations. This means that tables and figures always have\n  an |id| attribute even when they are not referenced. (Or are\n  there also cases where tables and figures are not numbered?)\n\nThere are (at least) the following exceptions to the algorithm\ndescribed above:\n\n1. The contents of a figure form one (physical) entity, but\ninspection of the contents show that there are logical sub-figures\n(hidden) inside the figure. Example: the contents of figure~2 contains\nmarkers `a', `b' and `c', which indicate logical sub-figures 2a, 2b and\n2c.\n\n2. Normal equation numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) is interrupted by an\nequation number that is `derived from' an earlier one. Example: (1),\n(2), (3), (1'), (4), (5), ...\n\n3. Numbering in lists, or sub-numbering in equations, is\ninterrupted. Example: a numbered list with items 1, 2, 3, is followed\nby a paragraph of text (the || is on the same level as the\n|<l>|), and then the list continues 4, 5, 6. The intention of the\nauthor appears to be {\\em one\\/} list, but this list is\ninterrupted. A similar example can be found in equation sub-numbering:\nequations (4a) and (4b) are followed by a paragraph of text, followed\nby equations (4c) and (4d).\n\nBelow I will discuss each case separately.\n\nHidden sub-figures\n------------------\n\nWhen a figure (as far as we know, hidden sub-components occur only\nwith figures.) that exists as one physical entity consists of logical\nsub-entities, the only solution lies in adding this information, which\nlies *outside* the document, to the document. One possibility for this\nis to give the |<fig>| start tag a new attribute that specifies the\nlabels of the individual components. This enables generation of the\nlabels of the sub-figures.\n\nFirst an example of a regular case:\n\n  <fig id=fig4>\n  <fig id=fig4a><figlnk file=\"fig4a\"></fig>\n  <fig id=fig4b><figlnk file=\"fig4b\"></fig>\n  </fig>\n\nHere the outer figure and the two nested figures each have their own\nunique key for referencing (fig4, fig4a, fig4b), and we have the\nfollowing (id, label) pairs:\n\n  (fig4, 4)  (fig4a, (4 1))  (fig4b, (4 2))\n\nwhere the counter strings (4 1) and (4 2) are represented as `4a' and `4b'\n(but this presentation is application-dependent of course).\n\nSecond an example of hidden sub-figures:\n\n  <fig id=fig4>\n  <figlnk file=\"fig4\">\n  </fig>\n\nthe picture in |fig4| contains two labels, `a' and `b', that identify\nsub-figures. Both the figure as a whole and the individual sub-figures\nare referenced. If we add an attribute to the start tag we can achieve\nthis: |<fig id=fig4 comp=\"a b\"^gt;|. The keys `fig4a' and `fig4b' are\nimplied (automatically generated); these implied keys act as aliases\nfor `fig4', since they refer to the same physical object.\nUnfortunately, the attribute |comp=\"a b\"| also suggests a\npresentation. Now we have the following (id, label) pairs:\n\n  (fig4, 4)  (fig4a, (4 1))  (fig4b, (4 2))\n\nwhere |4|, |(4 1)| and |(4 2)| refer to the same object\n(physical figure) in the document instance.\n\nDerived equation numbers\n------------------------\nWe illustrate this case with an example. Suppose an article contains\nthe following sequence of equations: (1), (2), (3), (1'), (4), (5),\n... In that case we have the following (id, label) pairs for the first\nthree equations:\n\n  (eq1, 1)  (eq2, 2)  (eq3, 3)\n\nThe next equation should have an (id, label) pair like this:\n\n  (eq$1, label(eq1)')\n\nwhere |eq$1| is the unique |id| assigned to equation~(1'), and\n|label(eq1)| stands for the label of the equation with id=eq1.\n\nAnd the next equation, (4), should have an (id, label) pair like this:\n\n  (eq4, 4)\n\nThe question is whether appending material to an existing label is the\nonly form of derivation, or whether other forms of derivation exist.\n\nInterrupted sequences\n---------------------\nThis case occurs with list items within a numbered list, or with\nnumbered sub-equations. (Lists look like a special case of nesting:\nnumbering of list items normally starts with 1, but every list item\nmust have an \\verb|id| that is unique within the document. This could\nbe achieved if we also numbered the parent element \\verb|<l^gt;|.)\n\nSuppose we have\n\n  <l>\n  <li id=\"liA\">a footnote is ...\n  <li id=\"liB\">footnotes should be ...\n  </l>\n  A paragraph of text comes between the two numbered lists.\n  <l>\n  <li id=\"liC\">a figure is ...\n  <li id=\"liD\">a table is ...\n  </l>\n\nand the author has numbered the list items as 1, 2, 3, 4. We agreed\nearlier that one of the guiding principles is to follow the author\nunless there are errors in the manuscript.\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n3. \"HTML-Math is intended to allow ... as well as rendering to\ngraphical bitmapped displays.\" What about rendering to paper??\n\n4. \"There are hundreds of symbols in use in mathematics.\" For those\nof you who think this is covered by Unicode, Computer Modern fonts and\nthe AMS fonts (although the latter *are* very useful), should study\npages 47-50 of the following document\n\n    ftp://ftp.elsevier.nl/pub/sgml/artdoc.ps.gz\n\nThis is the documentation of our article DTD, and it contains\ntables with *all* symbols and characters we use in typesetting our\nproducts. There is redundancy in it, I know. But more important is\nthat to cover this set 100% you need more than the font sets I\nmentioned earlier. Elsevier Science is in discussion with several\nsocieties about the possibility of completing a font set that\ncovers all this, and perhaps more, and make it freely available.\nThis will also solve legal problems with embedding fonts or parts\nof fonts in PDF files.\n\n5. Superiors/inferiors: I think we should add something about\nvertical position of inferiors in mathematics and chemistry (these\ndiffer, as some of you may know).\n\n6. In the list of layout idioms I believe there is at least\none missing, namely an arrow that adjusts its width to the text\nappearing above or below it. This is used in chemical formulas, and\nis different from an arrow or brace AS ORNAMENT, that adjusts its width\nto the text underneath it. Examples of both:\n\n    \\widebrace{a b c ... x y z} (the brace is the ornament)\n\n           catalyst\n      A  -----------> B         (the text above the arrow is the ornament)\n\n7. In example 2 a lot of reserved words occur: from, to, of. How\ndo you get these words as normal words in the text (in roman)?\n\n8. What about coding fractions: are we going to follow LaTeX and most\nSGML DTD's and use something like (fraction (numerator ...)\n(denominator ...)) or are we copying the horrible TeX construct\n(... over ...)? I've been asked by people on the LaTeX3 development\nteam to express a strong preference for the former, and a strong\ndislike for \\over!\n\nThat's it. I'll try to monitor the corner designated to our group\non www.w3.org, although the password Dave gave me doesn't work!  :-)\n\nIf Dave can let me know several days in advance when a telephone\nconference occurs (on Monday evenings) I can try to attend. But\nthere will be Mondays on which I am not at home from 7 pm to midnight\n(that's 12 noon to 5 pm EST, since we're in daylight saving time\nas of last weekend).\n\nRegards,\n\nNico\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDr. Nico A.F.M.

V. Raman   (left early)\nRalph Youngen\nRon Whitney\nBruce Smith\nNeil Soiffer\n\nThe meeting discussed Bruce's new proposal, see:\n\n        http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Math/WG/Smith-960531.html\n\nDave asked about lexical details. For instance if one uses an SGML\nnamed character entity how does the tokenizer know whether the\ncharacter is allowed as part of an identifier? Bruce replied that\nthere needs to be a large dictionary that specifies properties such\nas:\n\n    o   Whether the character is allowed as the first or subsequent\n        characters in an identifier.\n\n    o   If it is an operator, its types (prefix/infix/postfix) and the\n        associated left and right precedences.\n\n    o   Whether it can be used to embellish other operators.\n\nAction: Bruce to add a detailed schema for the character dictionary.\n\nDave also suggested that as a matter of principle any tag names should\nhave meaningful names. Bruce said he wanted to avoid potential naming\nconflicts with other groups wishing to define new HTML tags. Dave said\nthat this wasn't a big problem, given W3C's role in defining HTML.\n\nAction: Dave to post a proposal for the HTML-math tag names.\n\nRobert added that to allow him to implement the proposal he would need\nmore detail on the various layout schema. Bruce will work on this.\n\nDave queried the flat associativity with same precedences for `+' and `-'.\nNeil explained that this makes it much easier to write the line breaking\nalgorithm.\n\nMacro definitions. Bruce will add an SGML element to represent these.\nThis raises the issue of scoping and how a plug-in could exploit the\nHTML parse tree. In the short term, this will remain a problem.\n\nWe discussed the representation for arrays. Dave explained that the\nHTML 3.0 proposal borrowed from LaTeX and TeX. See:\n\n    http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html3/arrays.html\n\nIt supports:\n\n    o   setting position of array relative to\n        preceding and followng expressions\n\n    o   column specification for cell alignment\n\n    o   cells spanning multiple rows or columns\n\n    o   \"+\", \"-\" or \"=\" characters as column separators\n\n    o   separation of first row/column as labels\n\n    o   setting left and right bracket symbols\n\n    o   filling a cell spanning several columns with dots\n\nThe features needed for math make it inappropriate to use the HTML\ntable tags.\n\nWe discussed what HTML tags might be appropriate within HTML-math.\nThe current inability to call the browser to handle such nested tags\nsuggests we need to take a cautious approach. A the minimum we probably\nneed:\n\n    o   plain text\n\n    o   simple kinds of emphasis (bold/italic)\n\n    o   control over font size\n\n    o   hypertext links\n\n    o   line numbering\n\nWe could further allow this text to include math elements so that we get\nmath including text including math etc. This doesn't seem to be needed\nin practice though.\n\nThe current plug-in api's are inadequate. For instance one would like to\nknow the current font family, size and baseline position, as well as the\nbackground color or texture tile and pattern origin. One would like to\nset the visible size according to the expression being displayed, and\nto be sent a message when relevant parameters are changed. How can CSS\nbased style sheets influence the style properties used within plugins?\nDave would like the math-erb to put pressure on browser vendors to fix\nthese problems.\n\nAction: Neil to investigate Netscape Navigator 3.0 plug-in SDK to see\nwhat improvements have been made to the api.\n\nOne short term solution would be to add parameters to the math tags\nto specify the context in which the elements occur, e.g. <h1>, or .\nThe control panel for the html-math plug-in would allow the user to\nset the font size to be used in these contexts.\n\nWe discussed ideas for folding and unfolding expressions. One idea is\nto allow the author to name a subexpression and then to use that name\nin place of further occurrences of that subexpression. When folded the\ngiven name would be shown in place of the subexpression itself. The\nscope for such definitions shouldn't be resticted to a single math\nelement. This could be supported via SGML tags and attributes.\n\nBruce talked through the case where names for subexpressions are generated\nautomatically at browse-time.

My own perceptions of this\ncommittee's work to date follow.\n\nWhile the immediate goal of an HTML-Math capability might have been to\nsimply render math visually (and perhaps this was the goal of\nHTML-Math 3), that goal has been considerably expanded as we look at\nissues now.  Insofar as the work of the ISO 12083 Math Committee\nstopped short of recommending ways to handle \"semantic\" aspects of\nmath markup, recognizing that the issues were many and difficult, the\nwork of this committee in that regard feels to me a welcome addition\nto the overall discussion of those sorts of problems.  And as the\nsemantics of any formal discipline lies rather closer to form than\nI've heard many SGML diehards acknowledge, I also welcome this\ncommittee's efforts to examine a more primitive notational base for\nthe standard.  This effort, in some sense competing with Roy Pike's,\nseems very healthy to me.  Pike appears undissuadable in my view.\n\nThe Wolfram proposal certainly acknowledges the need to accommodate\nSGML entities and supports and SGML style of markup.  In my recent\nlist of questions and comments to Bruce, I made reference to the fact\nthat I felt ISO 12083 Math gave a good basis for the fundamental\nlayout schemata and might better be used than TeX for HTML-math.\nI was hoping, and still do, that formal support such as this would\ngive a direct means of filtering ISO 12083 math into HTML-math.  Support\nin this way gives strong acknowledgement to prior SGML work.\n\nAnd then there may be the feeling that WRI is pushing a standard of\nits own.  While Stephen himself broadcasts at a very powerful wattage,\nI've found the committee members from WRI quite accommodating and\nundogmatic.  I view their contributions as wholly positive.  I'm\ncertain that Nico was *not* asserting otherwise, but I would\ncommunicate this to others from outside the committee if a perception\nof a WRI-centric \"standard\" is misapprehended.  This is a quiet\nstatement, not a defensive one.\n\n\n-Ron\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "lists-046-12146425", "class": "email"}

Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award. Their chances are small, however, as their arguments rely on polemic, exaggeration and misrepresentation -- in other words, on the same techniques which they accuse Moore of using. \nDear David Hardy, \nIt is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary. In a time of simple-minded patriotism, loud, clear and dissenting voices like Mr. Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative \"grass-roots\" propaganda. Not surprisingly, much of the criticism of Moore's film is misguided or outright wrong, often vastly more inaccurate than Moore's work itself. \n\nMoore portrays the NRA as an unethical, dishonest organization; he sees the paranoia and fear in the United States as a primary cause of violence, and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem. His documentary is full of subtle humor, jaw-dropping dialogue and dark contrasts. All in all, it is an accurate portrayal of America's gun and violence culture. It also raises questions about America's foreign policy of recent decades, questions which have been all but ignored by Moore's critics. \nOn your webpage, you state that \"Moore's resolution is questionable. After all, early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence -- because Canadians like, and Japanese positively love, those. If violent movies and violent videogames cannot cause violence -- then how can newscasts about violence do so?\" \nThis is a faulty generalization. If, as Moore implies (although never states as fact), video games and violent movies are relatively harmless, it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless. There is a huge difference, for example, between playing a game like \"Quake\" and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now. The latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, which killed 800,000 people. Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved. \nObviously, media propaganda can incite people to kill. Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven. Moore's hypothesis (which apparently comes at least in part from the book \"Culture of Fear\" by Barry Glassner, also advertised on Moore's website) is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia, which itself can lead to violent acts. This is consistent with the kind of media-incited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence. It is no surprise, however, that US (and European) media do not question their own propaganda of fear. \nMoore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts, a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists. Children who grow up in war-torn regions are known for having similar views -- war is perceived as a normal part of existence, violence as a natural way to solve disputes. In a weaker sense, the same message is projected to American children, who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another, but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how \"the enemies of freedom\" are punished. Moore's film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV. Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show: \n\"They squealed like little piggies too, so you'll have to make do with 'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll' for their last words. That goes for your grandson Mustafa too, by the way. Still think fucking with the U.S. was a good idea, Sammy?\" \nMustafa was 14 years when he was killed. Americans cheer the killing of children, yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations. It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moore's film seeks to address. \nInaccuracies \nYour webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moore's movies. It is true that Moore's film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive, but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme. It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades. Let's look at some specific criticisms: \n1) The bank scene, listed on your website on a separate page. Critics have stated that this scene was \"staged\", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time. It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, an employee claims that the gun would have been \"normally\" picked up at another dealer. It is not explained what \"normally\" is supposed to mean, but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film. This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore. \nThe only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe. According to the same WSJ interview, \"Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period.\" This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed. Moore's detractors have sometimes extended those 7-10 days to several weeks, contradicting the bank's own estimate. \nThere is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene. The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account. The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation: a bank handing out guns to its customers, higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious. \n2) The Lockheed-Martin interview. This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate. First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly. The dialogue goes as follows: \nMoore: \"So you don't think our kids say to themselves, gee, dad goes off to the factory every day - he builds missiles. These are weapons of mass destruction. What's the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?\" \nMcCollum (PR person): \"I guess I don't see that specific connection because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us.\" \nFirst, note the word \"our\" in Moore's question. Moore is not from Colorado -- his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question. McCollum understands it this way -- otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized. However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant. \nEven Lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible. In response to one Moore detractor, McCollum wrote: \"Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited.\" Of course, critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military, and that the company is the nation's largest military contractor. As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons, but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults. \nYes, Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant -- but he makes no incorrect statement. It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims. \n3) Denver NRA meeting. Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards. \nFirst, the \"from my cold, dead hands\" part: This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston. It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes, shown on national TV even here in Germany. It tells viewers: Aha, this is the person we are talking about. Nowhere does Moore say or imply that these words were uttered at the rally in Denver, and in fact, their reptition later in the movie at another occasion (oddly claimed by critics to be again \"misattributed\") is simply a reminder of this. It is Moore's way to say: Viewers, meet Charlton Heston, gun nut extraordinaire. \nThe \"visual of a billboard and a narration\" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver. Moore is a professional filmmaker -- he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites, and to accomplish that effect, uses subtle interludes instead of long-winded introductions. This is a common technique, but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking, they believe critics who claim that he is \"distorting\" the interview. What he does is standard filmmaking practice. \nThe same goes for the interview which follows. Moore's critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety, have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of \"balance\". The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so. They were right. You claim that there was \"no way to change location, since you have to give advance notice of that to the members, and there were upwards of 4,000,000 members.\" 10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date, had the NRA really wanted to. It is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money, not to piss off the victims of Colubmine. That does not change the fact that they did just that. Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff. This is what good documentary filmmaking is about. And here the critics again ignore important evidence: \nWhen Heston mentions the mayor of Denver, the crowd boos loudly. Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!). This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said \"Fuck you\". To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics. \n4) The Kayla Rolland case. Again, critics like yourself charge Moore with deception. The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29. Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion: \"Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas. It is brilliantly, if unethically, done.\" As noted above, the \"from my cold dead hands\" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston. Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else? He certainly does not \"attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered\" and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is. \nConcerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: \"There is no indication that [Heston] recognized Kayla Rolland's case.\" This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence. Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview, he certainly knew about the case at that point. \nRegarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase \"48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead\": This is one valid criticism, but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing. The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there (as will become quite obvious), but simply to highlight the first mention of the name \"Kayla Rolland\" in the text, which is in this paragraph. \nUnfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression. It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website. However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons: \na) Moore clearly states that \"before he came to Flint\", Heston gave an interview. In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March. If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published? \nb) Why should Moore leave the words \"Clinton is on the Today Show\" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part? I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing. \nc) Both the \"soccer mom\" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact. The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that \"we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland\". You make the hysterical claim that the interview \"may be faked\" (on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee), but if Moore had faked it, why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla's death? Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out? This makes no sense. \nOpinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of \"Bowling\" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston. The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as \"Hanlon's Razor\" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence. The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly. Had they done so, Moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe. In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is \"full of lies\". \n5) You write: \"Having created the desired impression, Moore follows with his Heston interview.\" No, he doesn't. You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself. The Heston interview is at the very end of the movie. After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of \"people from all over America\", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating. These people do not feel the need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel the need to assert their \"rights\" and to look for quick, simple answers -- as Busch states, gun owners wanted to \"hang [the child] from the highest tree\". This is all not mentioned by critics of Moore's movie, who claim to be objective. \nPerhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding Moore's film is your sub-essay \"Is the end of the Heston interview itself faked?\" \nMoore answers a simple question -- how could the scene have been filmed -- with a simple answer: two cameras. From this, you construct an obscure conspiracy of \"re-enactment\": \"For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted 'Hey!' to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left.\" Even if your \"re-enactment\" theory is true (and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion), this itself is not unethical, and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here, just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview. You use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader, without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion. \n6)Animated history of the US. Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film. But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \"gun rights\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish. Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it. But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK. This is the key message of this part of the animation, which is again being ignored by its critics. \n7) Buell shooting in Flint. You write: \"Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before\". This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against. It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset. The kid was a little bastard, and the parents were involved in drugs -- case closed. But why do people deal with drugs? Because it's so much fun to do so? It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American \"contras\" \nIt is equally well known that the so-called \"war on drugs\" begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population (both in relative and absolute numbers). \nIn poor areas, the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort. But the real cause here are not the drugs themselves, but poverty and the \"war on drugs\". \nHad the boy's mother not been shipped to a \"welfare to work\" program, she might at least have had some time to spend with her son. Virtually every child psychologist knows that mother/child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities, the awareness of the consequences of one's actions, and the learning of conflict resolution by non-violent means. Even the official quoted by Moore blames the welfare to work program, knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring. Once again, your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moore's (and Busch's) assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes. \nThat's because while there is a so-called war on drugs, there is no war on poverty. Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural, and the poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCR-owners who are just too lazy to work. \nIn reality, what Moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen, to the detriment of families. \nIt is notable that the Wall Street Journal's reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours: It called Moore's claim \"preposterous\". How could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens? \n8) Taliban and American aid. After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour. Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies. Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage. Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal. Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore's website about the film. \n9) Gun homicides. Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics don't dwell on them longer. That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have a far greater homicide rate (both gun- and non-gun) than most other first world countries. His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data, his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources (and, as you correctly point out, he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries). A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite.com website. \nNot surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years -- as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology. The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are: \nJapan: 0.02 per 100,000 (1994)England/Wales: 0.11 per 100,000 (1997)Germany: 0.22 per 100,000 (1994)Australia: 0.44 per 100,000 (1994)United States: 3.72 per 100,000 (1999)\nCritics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make -- concluding that gun ownership \"leads\" to violence. In fact, Moore mentions several counter-examples, and more such counter-examples can indeed be cited. It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence -- but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly. It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John \"Mary\" Lott. \nThe gun control movement, on the other hand, distracts from the real causes of violence -- poverty, paranoia, the \"war on drugs\" and antisexuality. If these causes were addressed, gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem (but also unnecessary); just like it is in Switzerland. \n10) Canada ammunition purchase. You write: \nBowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart. He asks us to \"look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart.\" He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised. \"That's right. I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada. Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal. \nOnce again, you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and \"faking\" (a word which \"Canadian officials\" have never used; for such a distortion, Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics). If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson, there is nothing fraudulent about that. He made no claims whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification. His claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarkets is independent from that claim. \n11) Heston's allegedly implied racism. You conclude from Heston's own words that Heston was somehow portrayed as racist. If anything, it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with \"having a more mixed ethnicity\". Heston's answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful. While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition, if he is unable to defend the interests of the NRA, he should not be their spokesman. In this case, Hanlon's Razor can be applied to Heston -- he is probably not racist, but incompetent. Your accusations of inappropriate cutting are once again entirely unsupported -- in fact, it is quite clear from watching that particular scene that there is not a single cut from the point at which Moore asks Heston a second time for the cause of the higher violence in the States, and the point when he mentions the Kayla Rolland incident. If Heston makes himself look like a fool, that should hardly be blamed on Michael Moore. \nConclusion \nYou write: \"Bowling for Columbine is dishonest. It is fraudulent. To trash Heston, it even uses the audio/video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give, and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewer's mind to a wrong conclusion.\" None of this is true. What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries, one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture. It is not a flawless diamond -- the \"48 hours\" scene in particular suffers from bad editing, the statistics are suboptimal, and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves. Other than towards the NRA, the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions, and comes up with some thoughtful answers. The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics. Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film, he would have used other material: photos from America's Emergency Rooms. \nCertainly, Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today, and his film fully deserved its Oscar. The shrill (and remarkably unsuccessful) Internet campaign to \"revoke\" his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the film's accuracy. It is not only the highest grossing non-music documentary of all time, among the users of the largest Internet film database, IMDB, it is also the highest rated one. According to the LA Times, the documentary genre \"owes a huge debt to Michael Moore\" -- after Bowling's success, films like \"Spellbound\" and \"Capturing the Friedmans\" were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely. \nBut perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason. His next project has the working title \"Fahrenheit 9/11: The temperature at which freedom burns\", and he intends to launch it shortly before the next US presidential election. It is unlikely, however, that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact. After all, the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous record-holding documentary: \"Roger & Me\" by Michael Moore. \nYours sincerely, \nErik M\u00f6ller \nThis text is in the public domain. \n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "A_defense_of_Michael_Moore", "class": "essays"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/essays/Ant_Robot", "text": "\n   \n      \n         \n            Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching\n            Sonia Roberts\n            11/27/07\n            Introduction\n            \n            Background\n            Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years. Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society. Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler. Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees, ants and cockroaches, and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already (Halloy et al, 2007). No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them. Such a robot would allow for both long-term studies of ant-robot interactions and studies of task-switching in the robots. I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot (hereafter referred to as Antie) that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest, switching between the foraging, patrolling and midden work behaviors.\n            \n            Environment\n            The red harvester ant lives in hot, dry deserts, building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain. The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds, many of which do not grow in the desert (Gordon, 54), where only a few varieties of small shrubs, small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow (Gordon, 51). Other insects and creatures, including other species of ants, are present in the desert, but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals (Gordon, 7-11). Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests, intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive (Gordon, 11). Because of this, I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie, and will not create a fighting behavior. Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil.\n            \n            The Ant & the Robot\n            Ants of this species are of two types: breeding ants (queens and drones) and sterile female workers. Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season, which occurs but once per year. The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging. Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest. Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest, but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest (midden work) occurs close enough to the surface to be observable. Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for the most part outside of the nest, and have therefore been studied extensively (ex., Schafer, et al, 2006; Gordon, et al, 2002; Gordon, 2002; Gordon, 1987). It is therefore these three behaviors that I would like to focus on in this proposal: the others remain a bit too mysterious to yet model, and the ability of a robot to pass undetected in the depths of a colony would be very difficult to observe.\n            These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems. In the case of midden work, Antie must be able to identify garbage, grasp it, carry it out of the nest, and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum (or until stimulated to switch behaviors). Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling. An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit. Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers\u2019 cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest. An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is. This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998). In addition to following these trails to the food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to the nest. Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks (as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task), walk, navigate both within and outside of the nest, and of course switch tasks at appropriate times.\n            \n            The Agent \n            \n            Chassis\n            Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system. Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C, for which some pseudocode is included. Sensors will include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors. Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization. A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs. Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging. These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted. Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance. For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day. A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached. (Fig 1)\n            \n            Sensors\n            In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors. In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible, these sensors include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors and sonar, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae. On its front grippers, Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure. The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function.\n            The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way, and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius. Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius (Gordon, 9), and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in-nest navigation.\n            Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant\u2019s eyes. These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night: the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night (Gordon, 5).\n            The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects. The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation, and the bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate the escape function. The sonar will correspond to the ant\u2019s limited optical object detection ability, and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions.\n            The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and -45 degrees from the center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern. These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants\u2019 eyes sensitive to polarized light, and research has shown that many insects, including ants, do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer (Labhart, et al, 2002). Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers. (Fig 2) The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie, who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest: Upon each exit from the nest, Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky, and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later. This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest, given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning.\n            \n            \n               \n            \n            Fig. 2. Diagram of the polarization-opponent unit described by Lambrinos, et al (2000). The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier, which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes. The e-vector (heading) returned from the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes (1, 2) follows a cos2-function.\n            \n            Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting \u201cstalks\u201d with which to both interact with other ants (who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae) and take in chemical information. These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n-alkene levels present in another ant\u2019s cuticular hydrocarbons, which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate\u2019s current task, perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun, causing a different ratio of n-alkanes to n-alkenes and the presence of branched n-alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile (Wagner, et al, 2001, as cited in Gordon & Greene, 2003). Antie\u2019s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves, which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate (Arnold, et al, 1996, as cited in Gordon & Mehdiabadi, 1999), receptors to detect food, and receptors for three types of pheromones: those released by successful foragers returning with food, those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest, and those marking piles of trash as midden. Research shows that successful foragers returning to the nest do have a different effect on the inactive workers than unsuccessful foragers returning (Schafer, et al, 2006). Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007). Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species (Gordon, 35). For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone. All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks, with four of each type of receptor per stalk. This technique, described by Ishida, et al (2001), has been shown to improve the chemical plume-tracking abilities of robots. The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the on-board PC.\n            Finally, Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object. These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson, et al (Patent #4,492,949), and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage. These will correspond to the muscles of the ant\u2019s mandibles, which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects. A table of the sensors and their relation to the ant\u2019s sensory system is provided below.\n            \n            Fig 3.

There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs. Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers, emulating the grasping power of the ant\u2019s mandibles. A third motor will lift and lower the grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head. Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs. These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt. Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task, on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants. Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section.\n            \n            The Behavior\n            \n            Antie will have a hybrid software architecture: a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors, but many sub-behaviors will operate on a schema basis. Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked.\n            \n            Common Behaviors\n            A few sub-behaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior. To ease Antie\u2019s on-board memory requirements and processing capabilities (and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand), I propose a few global variables and subroutines.\n            The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference:\n            \n            // number representing calibration for speed\n            double calibrate = 0;\n            \n            // constant representing the light at sunrise\n            double sunrise;\n            \n            // outputs\n            double left_motor_OP = 0;// left wheel motor\n            double right_motor_OP = 0; // right wheel motor\n            \n            // inputs\n            double photo_IP;// photoreceptor\n            double temp_IP;// thermometer\n            \n            // Array inputs from left and right midden pheromone \n            // detectors.

The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos, et al. Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest, and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance. We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters. The first function might look something like this:\n            \n            // Nest Orient\n            // Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs\n            // and returns the location of the nest in degrees.\n            int nestOrient(double left_POL_IP, double right_POL_IP) {\n            int degrees = 0;\n            // Calculates direction of nest, and returns as degrees.\n            return degrees;\n            } // end nestOrient\n            \n            The second function, which would return the distance in centimeters, might look something like this:\n            \n            // Nest Distance\n            // Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs\n            // and returns the current distance to the nest.\n            int nestDist(double left_POL_IP, double right_POL_IP) {\n            int dist = 0;\n            // Calculates distance from nest, returning distance in cm.\n            return dist;\n            } // end nestDist\n            \n            In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie\u2019s thermometer and a light source. To exit, Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight, and to get deeper, Antie will seek a lower temperature. The code may look something like this:\n            \n            // Exit Nest\n            // Uses temperature gradient to navigate towards the nest\n            // entrance from inside\n            \n            void nestExit() {\n            // Reads temperature, scoots forward 1s, reads temperature\n            // again, takes the difference, and determines whether current \n            // heading is increasing temperature reading. If not, rotates // 45 degrees and tries again.\n            while(photo_IP < sunrise) {\n            double temp = temp_IP;\n            while([timer] < 1){\n            forCruz(5);\n            }\n            temp -= temp_IP;\n            if(temp>0) rotate(45);\n            } // end nestExit\n            \n            To enter the nest, such as at the end of a task, Antie will perform the same function, except it will seek a lower temperature instead of a higher temperature, it will avoid light, and it will only activate while Antie is less than 10cm from the nest entrance. This void function will be called nestEnter(), and will take in no inputs. \n            To avoid bumping into things (including other ants), Antie be provided with an escape function. Each of Antie\u2019s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount, and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction. Regardless, this will be a very simple function. I will include one example:\n            \n            // Escape\n            // Escapes from danger when bump sensors or sonar are \n            // activated.\n            \n            void escape() {\n            // Declare and initialize left bump sensors in \n            // order from front to back.\n            bump_left1;\n            bump_left2;\n            bump_left3;\n            bump_left4;\n            // Declare and initialize right bump sensors in \n            // order from front to back.\n            // Sonar sensors are globally declared.\n            \n            if(bump_left1) {\n            // reverse \u2026 (at reduced speed)\n            forCruz(-3);\n            // \u2026 and rotate!\n            rotate(45);\n            }\n            } // end escape\n            \n            Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie\u2019s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds.\n            Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them. This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated. Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell. Objects will include midden and food. The code may look something like this:\n            \n            // Object Identification\n            // Identifies an object that has snuck up on the \n            // unsuspecting robot.\n            \n            void objID() {\n            // Declare and initialize front bump sensor.\n            // Sonar sensors are globally declared.\n            \n            // Check inputs to determine which smell is strongest\n            // if food smell is detected at higher rate and \n            // above the food threshold for detection, Antie \n            // assumes object is food\n            while (bump_front || (sonar_left_IP && sonar_right_IP)) {\n            if(((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) \n            < ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP))\n            && ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP) \n            > food_threshold) {\n            food_detect = true;\n            }\n            // if midden smell is detected at higher rate \n            // and above threshold for midden detection, \n            // Antie assumes object is midden\n            else if(((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) \n            > ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP))\n            && ((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) \n            > midden_threshold) {\n            midden_detect = true;\n            }\n            } // end objID\n            \n            Once the object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it. A simple void function grip() taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached, at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying. A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse.\n            Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers, and localize the source of food-odors and midden-odors. Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on \u201cantennae\u201d stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones. As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing, a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie\u2019s four sensors on each stalk. The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a \u201cleft_IP\u201d or \u201cright_IP.\u201d Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg\u2019s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book \u201cVehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,\u201d as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models. Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine. Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis:\n            \n            // Follow Gradient\n            // Follows a generic chemical gradient, seeking a higher\n            // concentration.\n            \n            void gradientFollow() {\n            // Compares left and right inputs and activates opposite\n            // motor to a greater degree. \n            if (left_IP > right_IP) {\n            [schema] {\n            rotate(-90);\n            forCruz(5);\n            } // end schema\n            } // end if\n            if (right_IP > left_IP) {\n            [schema] {\n            rotate(90);\n            forCruz(5);\n            } // end schema\n            } // end if\n            else forCruz(5);\n            } // end gradientFollow\n            \n            For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow(), findFood(), and findMidden(). All three are void and take no inputs.\n            The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants. When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously, Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate. As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non-nestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest. Research has shown that red harvester ants may identify the tasks nestmates are engaged in based on the ratio of n-alkenes to n-alkanes in their hydrocarbons and the presence or absence of branched n-alkanes. The difference in ratio is caused by the time ants spend outside in the sun, which depletes their n-alkene levels. Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n-alkene levels. The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this:\n            \n            // Ant Identification\n            // Identifies an ant that has snuck up on the \n            // unsuspecting robot.\n            \n            void antID() {\n            while (left_sonar_IP && right_sonar_IP) {\n            // Are hydrocarbons present? (Is this a nestmate?)\n            if((left_hydrocarb_IP + right_hydrocarb_IP)\n            > hydrocarb_threshold) {\n            nestmate_detect = true;\n            // In what task is the nestmate engaged?\n            if (n-alkene level is appropriate for a forager) {\n            forager_detect = true;\n            }\n            if (n-alkene level is appropriate for a patroller) {\n            patroller_detect = true;\n            }\n            if (n-alkene level is appropriate for a midden worker) {\n            midworker_detect = true;\n            } // If not midden work, foraging or patrolling, ignore\n            } // If not nestmate, ignore\n            }\n            } // end antID\n            \n            Using these basic common behaviors, more complex behaviors may be coded.\n            Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996). Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age (ex., Ingram, et al, 2005) and partially as a function of interactions with other workers (ex., Schafer et al, 2006; Gordon, 2002; Greene & Gordon, 2007). Younger ants work more inside the nest, and older ants work more outside the nest. As a result, I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in. Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior. Finally, I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors.\n            The midden work behavior will be Antie\u2019s default initial behavior. It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise, and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52\u00ad\u00ad\u00adoC, at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest. As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden. A program encoding this behavior might look like this:\n            \n            //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            // MIDDEN WORK\n            //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            // Antie will leave nest in the morning after sunrise,\n            // carrying bits of midden halfway down the nest mound\n            // and depositing them. Antie will return to the nest and\n            // repeat this task until the temperature reaches above\n            // 52 degrees Celsius.\n            \n            void midden() {\n            \n            // Initiated by sunrise, stopped by temperature\n            while (photo_IP > sunrise && temp_IP < 52) {\n            // Find midden and identify any found objects. If\n            // they are midden, grip and carry outside nest.\n            findMidden();\n            objID();\n            if(midden_detect) {\n            grip();\n            nestExit();\n            // cruise to halfway down the nest mound\n            while(nestDistance() < 25) {\n            forCruz();\n            }\n            release();\n            // reset midden_detect\n            midden_detect = 0;\n            nestEnter();\n            } // end if\n            } // end while\n            } // end midden\n            \n            The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling. Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest. This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age. Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005). It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling. In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34). Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests\u2019 territories (Gordon, 57-60). To control for this behavior, Antie\u2019s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones. This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths (Gordon, 45). The code may look something like this:\n            \n            // Explore\n            // Takes in desired distance from nest to explore \n            // in cm and moves in a slightly randomized zigzag \n            // pattern\n            \n            void explore(int distance, int time) {\n            // Local Variables\n            int time=0; // integer representing the time to \n             // wander one direction\n            int angle=0; // integer representing number of \n             // degrees to rotate\n            int dir=0; // integer representing the direction to \n             // turn (0=right, 1=left)\n            \n            // Random number generator to add a bit of wanderlust\n            RandomGenerator rGen = new RandomGenerator();\n            \n            // While loop; robot will keep zigging and zagging \n            // for a set amount of time\n            while ([timer] < time) {\n            if (ant's distance from nest < distance) {\n            // int time gets a random number of seconds \n            // between 3 and 10\n            time = rGen.nextInt(3,10);\n            // int angle gets a random number of degrees \n            // between 15 and 75\n            angle = rGen.nextInt(15,75);\n            \n            // function call to rotation subroutine\n            // if dir is 0, rotate to the right; if dir \n            // is 1, rotate to the left.\n            if (dir==0) {\n            dir = 1; // dir changes direction- turn \n             // left next time\n            rotate(angle); // rotate to the right\n            } else {\n            dir = 0; // dir changes direction- turn \n             // right next time\n            rotate(-angle); // rotate to the left\n            } // end rotation call\n            \n            // while loop to count down number of seconds \n            // using a timer\n            while ( [timer] < time) {\n            // command to go forward is given\n            goForward = 1;\n            // call to forward cruise function; \n            // straight cruise\n            forCruz(5,5);\n            } // end timer while loop\n            } // end distance from nest while loop\n            // if ant is approaching the desired distance,\n            // double back (at angle) to explore more!\n            if (ant's distance from nest ==\n            distance - some small constant) {\n            rotate(135);\n            } // end if\n            // Avoid leaving nest territory\n            else if (nestmate pheromones IP < very low threshold) {\n            while([short timer]) {\n            forCruz(5); // explore a bit further\n            } // end while\n            rotate(45);\n            } // end if\n            } // end if (distance from nest < distance)\n            } // end explore\n            \n            Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again. Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow. A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food. Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this (note that part is on a schema basis):\n            \n            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            // PATROLLING\n            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            //\n            // Main patrolling behavior function.\n            // Includes nest patrolling, trail patrolling and the\n            // stimulation and thresholds to initiate and switch between\n            // the two.\n            \n            // Nest Patrolling\n            // Patrollers' first job of the day: exit the nest and\n            // explore the nest mound, taking measurements.\n            void nestPatrol() {\n            while (photo_IP > [light at sunrise]\n            && temp_IP < 52 degrees Celsius ) {\n            nestExit();\n            // Nest mounds are generally up to 1m across\n            // Thus, explore in a 50cm radius (Gordon, 6)\n            explore(50, 120);\n            [schema] {\n            rotate(nestOrient());\n            forCruz(5);\n            nestEnter();\n            }\n            wait a short time\n            } // end if\n            } // end nestPatrol\n            \n            // Trail Patrolling\n            // Patrollers exit nest and attempt to find food.

The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks.\n            \n            // PATROLLING\n            // Task-switching hierarchy for the two types of patrolling\n            void patrol() {\n            while (age > nestpatrol_age && age < trailpatrol_age) {\n            nestPatrol();\n            }\n            while (age > trailpatrol_age && age < forage_age) {\n            trailPatrol();\n            }\n            }\n            \n            The final behavior, foraging, will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R. Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume. This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest. This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them. It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise. The code for this, adapted from Russell\u2019s paper, might look like this:\n            \n            // Hex-path search\n            // Localizes an object through sand using chemical detection\n            void hexSearch() {\n            double intense1 = inensity at n-1;\n            double intense2 = intensity at n-2;\n            while (nothing in grippers) {\n            if (((intense2 > intense 1)\n            && last rotation was counterclockwise)\n            ||\n            (((intense2 < intense1)\n            && last rotation was clockwise)) {\n            rotate(-60);\n            while([short timer]) {\n            forCruz(5);\n            }\n            } // end if\n            else {\n            rotate(60);\n            while([short timer]) {\n            forCruz(5);\n            } // end while\n            } // end else\n            } // end while\n            } // end hexSearch\n            \n            Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path (Gordon, 47). To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon. The code might look like this:\n            \n            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            // FORAGING\n            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            //\n            // Main foraging behavior function.\n            // Foragers will exit the nest upon activation and follow\n            // a trail laid by the patrollers. Upon completion of the\n            // trail-following, will locate and grip food, returning\n            // to the nest. Boolean forage_today represents Antie\u2019s\n            // activation status for each day once it has switched to \n            // the foraging behavior.\n            \n            void forage() {\n            // Wait for a successful patroller to return.\n            if (sucpat_detect) forage_today = true;\n            while (forage_today && temp_IP < 52) {\n            nestExit();\n            trailFollow(); // Follow successful patroller trail.\n            // Note that this is NOT a schema basis, which would \n            // cause Antie to stop and retrieve food encountered en \n            // route.\n            // When end of plume is reached, retrieve food.\n            while (!food_detect) {\n            // while food has not yet been found, continue searching \n            // and identifying found objects\n            hexSearch();\n            objID();\n            }\n            // Once that loop has been broken, return to nest\n            [schema] {\n            // grip food and return to nest\n            grip();\n            rotate(nestOrient());\n            forCruz(5);\n            nestEnter();\n            }\n            // release food just inside nest entrance\n            release();\n            } // end while\n            } // end forage\n            \n            Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors. Because the midden work behavior is Antie\u2019s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work. Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie\u2019s CPU that will count its \u201cage\u201d since last boot. To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling. The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers\u2019 returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002). Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate. According to Schafer\u2019s, et al. model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue. For the purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly a function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers. The code to model this task-switching might look something like this:\n            \n            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            // TASK-SWITCHING\n            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            //\n            // Main function of Antie\u2019s software. Examines the task-\n            // switching criteria and determines when Antie will perform \n            // what behavior. Int \u201cage\u201d is an integer representing the\n            // time since Antie\u2019s last boot, corresponding to the age\n            // of an ant being simulated. Int nestpatrol_age refers to the \n            // starting age at which Antie will begin to nest patrol; \n            // forage_age refers to the starting age at which Antie may be \n            // activated to forage. This would correspond to the change in \n            // gene expression described by Gordon (2002).\n            \n            main() {\n            // default to midden work\n            while (age < nestpatrol_age) {\n            midden();\n            } // end while\n            // switch to patrolling behavior based on age\n            while (nestpatrol_age < age && age < forage_ave) {\n            patrol();\n            } // end while\n            // switch to foraging as a function of time, but \n            // remain inactive until stimulated by returning \n            // successful foragers\n            // Assume that inactive foragers will not smell different \n            // from patrollers, which was their last task, because \n            // they have not yet spent sufficient time in the sun.\n            if (sucfor_detect at time n-1 == false \n            && sucfor_detect at time n == 1) {\n            0.0035 probability: forage_active = true;\n            }\n            \n            while (age > forage_age && forage_active) {\n            forage();\n            }\n            } // end main\n            \n            \n            Conclusion\n            \n            Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants\u2019 behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary. Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            REFERENCES\n            \n            Braitenberg, V.

This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those \u201coutside\u201d them, those who do not belong. Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices. One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language. The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry. In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers. Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key. Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia. Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their \u201cindigenous identity\u201d, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages.\n            The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries. One of the most prominent, lasting influences is that of the land grant system. Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land. This was in turn replaced by the repartimento; the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish, providing labor and taxes as demanded. In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers. The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century. Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations; previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture. The Marxists, on the contrary, argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity. However, they also claimed that they were part of a larger group, the working class, whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7). \n            In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party. A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response. Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples. This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an \u201carmed and dangerous menace within\u201d, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25). This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts. In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced. The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord (Warren 2002: 157-158).\n            The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements. By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82). Central to these was the question of indigenous identity: largely lost amidst the overwhelming Spanish influence, local leaders sought to rediscover their native roots and redefine what it meant to be a part of indigenous culture. Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people. Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739). Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734). The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool. It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse . The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181). A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society. This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior. Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736). By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.\n            Colombia, in contrast, has no unified \"pan-Indian\" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language. Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85). The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82). It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84). Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109). The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2). This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other. In the 1990s the rhetoric of \"cultural diversity\" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole.\n            A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991, which includes a section on indigenous rights, as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57). Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty. While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities. They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52). The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity: no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era. The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58).\n            The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999. Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158). It failed, despite the Mayan majority; possible reasons include the overwhelming illiteracy rates among the indigenous population and inaccessibility of voting stations (Warren 2002: 149, 151). However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172). Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone (England 2003: 733). Nonetheless, in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language, recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion. While largely symbolic, it is still significant in that Guatemalan identity is seen as encompassing languages other than Spanish.\n            This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia. Within the pan-Mayan movement, there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity: some view the reduction of their language to the status of \"dialect\" devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world; however, despite differences over standardization, the pan-Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive. In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves. An example is the Tukanoans: while considered a single \u201cethnic group\u201d, they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of one language group must marry into another (Jackson 1995: 4). \n            Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture. Indigenous cosmology, or \u201ccosmovision\u201d, is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages; it maintains a concept of culture, defined as \u201cthe form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature\u201d (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58) and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought. Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed, often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non-governmental organizations. The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves: the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with. It is necessary to work within the national legal system in order to gain policy reform beyond the local level; however, with widely differing concepts of justice a a balance is difficult to achieve. Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships: tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony, crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime, but may have influenced the accused to do so. When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole. Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence, sharing in their ordeal. (Rappaport 2005) Once punishments are completed, the criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into the community (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 61, Rappaport 2005: 97).\n            Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision. The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59). This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture, and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing (Rappaport 2005: 93, 236). Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself. Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries. The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten (Rappaport 2005: 165).\n            This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use. Difficulties arise, however, as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop. Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers, raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use. The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought. In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new. The authenticity of the modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by the traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence(Rappaport 2005). In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so. Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya; thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions, which most often occurs under Spanish influence.\n            A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic \u201cIndianness\u201d, both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture. The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not \u201cIndian enough\u201d; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85). Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself. The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences. Efforts towards development, then, cannot endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy (Jackson 1995: 5). There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom. An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day-to-day basis (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 66-67).\n             This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed. In Guatemala, they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress; the pan-Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law. In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8). Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status, indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws (Jackson 1995: 5). Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever-persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment.\n            Works Cited\n            Gow, David D. and Joanne Rappaport. 2002. \u201cThe Indigenous Public Voice: The Multiple Idioms of Modernity.\u201d in Indigenous Movements, Self-Representation, and the State in Latin America.

Nobile\n            University of Washington\n            Before beginning an analysis of any piece by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used. Bart\u00f3k\u2019s music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure. This remains true even with one of his last compositions, the Concerto for Orchestra, written two years before his death in 1943. The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement. The analysis will treat the movement tonally, investigating the progression of local \u201ctonics\u201d and its relationship to the overall form. We will also examine to what degree a \u201ctonal\u201d reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bart\u00f3k strays from common-practice compositional techniques.\n            Harmonic Structure and Form\n            Bart\u00f3k describes the form of the first movement as \u201cmore or less regular sonata form.\u201d\n                  Bart\u00f3k, 431.\n                While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order. The \u201cbackwards\u201d recapitulation is a technique that Bart\u00f3k employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates.\n                  For example, the fifth string quartet. Also see Bart\u00f3k\u2019s comments on that (Bart\u00f3k, 414).\n                Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction. As the example shows, the development section is divided into three subsections; the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group, and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition. Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric.\n                  Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different. See Wilson, 168-170.\n               \n            \n            || Intro | FTG | STG | Dev I (FTG) | Dev II (new) | Dev III (FTG) | STG | FTG ||\n                  The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively.\n               \n            \n            example 1: formal structure of the first movement\n            Sonata form\u2014or, \u201cmore-or-less\u201d sonata form\u2014carries harmonic as well as formal connotations. While \u201ctonality\u201d in this piece (and in Bart\u00f3k\u2019s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure. To begin with, the movement is in F. When we say \u201cin F,\u201d we do not imply F major (or minor, for that matter)\u2014the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece\u2014but rather that the pitch-class F is the tonal center of the movement, and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement. Using this interpretation, we can map out the local tonics (tonal centers) used throughout the movement, as shown in Example 2.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 2: harmonic structure of the first movement\n            In this example, the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece (Introduction\u2013Exposition\u2013Development\u00ad\u2013Recapitulation)\u2014so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins. Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C\u266f to F through D\u266f (shown as D\u266d and E\u266d in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg. The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the \u201cdominant\u201d to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition. Bart\u00f3k has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet.\n                  See Bart\u00f3k, 414-415.\n                In this particular movement, Bart\u00f3k feigns moving to the tonal dominant, C, for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D\u266d and B\u2014this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections.\n            \n               \n            \n            Paul Wilson gives a detailed account of the foreground activity throughout this movement in his analysis; we do not seek to duplicate or substitute for his findings. Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure. The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements, it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced, this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper.\n            The Introduction\n            As Paul Wilson points out, the title \u201cIntroduzione\u201d given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures.\n                  Wilson, 172.\n                The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement\u2014in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section\u2014but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece. To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C\u266f as the tonal center. The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale. Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself. The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive. Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth, and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 3: measures 1-6 (celli and basses)\n            \n               \n            \n            example 4: measures 12-16 (celli and basses)\n            \n               \n            \n            example 5: measures 22-29 (celli, basses and violas)\n            Example 4 transitions from C\u266f to F\u266f, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths. Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths.\n                  If we begin from the final D\u266f and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.\n                Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F\u266f to D\u266f. The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C\u266f to D\u266f, through F\u266f; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D\u266d, E\u266d and G\u266d. As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F. So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth. We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths; indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often \u201cfilled in\u201d with the intervening fourth. This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm. 155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2. \n            Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples. This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8. So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole.\n            The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D\u266f, enharmonically respelled as E\u266d, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor. This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor. The concluding motive of this section in the violins (the bracketed sections of Example 6), as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff. (Example 7), are related to the first head motive of the first theme, which is shown in the first measure of Example 8. All three of these motives span a tritone, which as mentioned is the \u201cdominant\u201d relationship in this movement. Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as \u201cquite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,\u201d\n                  Wilson, 173.\n                but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 6: measures 56-58 (violin 1)\n            \n               \n            \n            example 7: measure 58 (violas, celli, basses); repeated through measure 75\n            The Exposition\n            Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears. The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over. As mentioned, the first theme, the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8, contains two head motives: the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure, and the second is an iteration of the interval cell (+5, -2, +5) that appears in the second through third measures. While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter, the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation. Rather, this motive is a small-scale representation of the tonic-dominant relationship of tritone partners, specifically F and B, that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 8: measures 76-80 (violins)\n            Rhythmically, we have a dissonance between the melody, which follows the written meter, and the accompanying chords in the bassoons, horns and lower strings. Example 9 reproduces the chords, and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern. As Example 10 shows, the chords are more-or-less in duple meter (4/8 and 2/8) with one \u201chiccup\u201d occurring in the 5/8 measure. This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody (with its own \u201chiccups\u201d occurring in the written 2/8 measures). As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 9: measures 77-91 (bassoons, horns, lower strings; reduced)\n            \n               \n            \n            example 10: measures 77-91 rebarred to reflect rhythmic pattern\n            We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F\u2014this is made clear from the onset, both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77. While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 76-94, these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F. E\u266d is the tonal center for measures 95-134, although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131. Measures 95-130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E\u266d, where E\u266d is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass. Example 11 illustrates this structure. Immediately following the arrival of E\u266d in the bass, C\u266f (D\u266d) is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme. The trombone motive in measures 134-141, shown in Example 12, is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development, although its importance is downplayed here. Note that the initial G\u266f is a pickup to the section in C\u266f, which fills in the whole-tone descent from E\u266d to C\u266f with the intervening fourth. This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G\u266f-C\u266f-B-E (with the addition of some passing tones), in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 11: bass structure of the first theme group, measures 76-155\n            \n               \n            \n            example 12: measures 134-141 (trombone)\n            Wilson claims that C and E\u266d are \u201clocal dominants\u201d to F in this first section of the exposition.\n                  Wilson, 174.\n                While the strong V-I motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context. E\u266d, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all. The passage from measures 85-89 is centered on E\u266d (and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step), but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function. Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E\u266d as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E\u266d at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2. In measures 91-95, the bass descends F-E\u266d-D\u266d-C, which might seem to support C\u2019s functioning as structural dominant. However, as previously mentioned, C acts as a \u201cfake\u201d dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B, the \u201ctrue\u201d dominant. The descent in measures 91-95 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C, which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger. This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge.\n            The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple, which is in stark contrast to the first theme. B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it. Measures 192-197 are in E\u266d, with the bass notes in the harp, and measures 198-209 are in D\u266d. A\u266d intervenes between E\u266d and D\u266d in measure 195\u2014another instance of the whole-tone being \u201cfilled in\u201d by a fourth. The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F\u266f in measures 208-209. Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E\u266d-D\u266d-B; the same stepwise descent (E\u266d-D\u266d) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged. Paul Wilson points out that \u201c[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.\u201d\n                  Wilson, 179.\n                In our terminology, this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant.\n            The Development\n            As mentioned, the development is divided into three subsections. In Example 2, the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches, and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center\u2014none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole-tone descent. As Paul Wilson states, the development \u201cis, for Bart\u00f3k\u2019s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way\u201d; the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified, and tonalities other than those expected arise.\n                  Wilson, 180.\n                The only slight abnormality, though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical-period sonata movements, is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development. Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on \u201ca transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],\u201d\n                  Wilson, 182.\n                there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives, and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed. Furthermore, this section, being the middle section of the movement, upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme.\n            The first section of the development, measures 231-271, begins with a big D-minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section. Although it moves to E\u266d minor in measure 239, it returns to D minor in measure 248, which suggests that E\u266d is an upper neighbor prolonging D. The passage beginning at measure 248, shown in Example 13, can be considered to be the \u201ctheme\u201d of this section, and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme. This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section. While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 13: measures 248-264 (violins)\n            The second section of the development is in C\u266f (which is sometimes spelled D\u266d). This section is reproduced as Example 14. This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section. Although the C\u266f major chord in measure 293, preceded by A\u266d major (V) in measure 285, suggests C\u266f as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303. The arrival at C\u266f was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C\u266f.\n                  Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group, we could conceive of C# as a sub-dominant in this movement. As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology\u2014there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms.\n               \n            \n            \n               \n            \n            example 15: measures 231-232 (violins and trumpets)\n            \n            \n               \n            \n            \n            example 14: measures 272-313 (reduction): development, part 2\n            The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17. The tonal center B\u266d is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong V-I chord progression (Example 16). As previously mentioned, the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme. The resultant set is the pentatonic set F-B\u266d-E\u266d-A\u266d-D\u266d; the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set. The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B\u266d rather than C, which allows Bart\u00f3k to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B\u266d as tonal center).\n            \n               \n            \n            example 16: measures 316-318: establishment of b\u266d\n            The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C. The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363. The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B\u266d is obscured as tonal center which allows A\u266d to emerge as the goal tone of this section\u2014only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation. Both B\u266d and A\u266d are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 17: measures 316-340 (brass): fugato section\n            \n               \n            \n            example 18: measures 342-349 (horns): inverted fugato subject\n            The Recapitulation\n            The recapitulation, as we have seen, presents the themes in reverse order. The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of the whole-tone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified. It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D, which constitutes another \u201cfilling in\u201d of the whole-step by the intervening fourth. The A\u266f in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure 444, which constitutes a V chord still applied to G. Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bart\u00f3k shifts briefly to F\u266f in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467. E and F\u266f are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme (measures 456-487) which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F, which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much-anticipated recapitulation of the first theme.\n            The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences. Firstly, its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it; the first chord in Example 9 is an F-minor triad, and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the F-minor scale. In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A\u266d is replaced by A\u266e in the melody. In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major\u2014while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A\u266d in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation.\n            In addition to the \u201cmode\u201d-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes. In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards the finish\u2014because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement. Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it\u2014it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout. There are also no phrase divisions\u2014the music simply drives forward with no pause until measure 514, where the fugato motive appears in the brass over an obvious V-I cadence, signaling the end of the movement which occurs as the motive completes.\n            \n               \n            \n            example 19: measures 488-494: the first theme in the recapitulation\n            \n               \n            \n            There is no fine line between music that is \u201ctonal\u201d and music that is \u201catonal.\u201d Bart\u00f3k is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality. While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work. Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music\u2014their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum. But if we apply it to music such as Bart\u00f3k\u2019s that is in the middle area, we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results. To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra. By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm, we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain, but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions. It is not disputed that Bart\u00f3k\u2019s music has great expressive power\u2014perhaps now we can understand why.\n            References\n            Antokoletz, Elliot.

What would our lives be without color? At the same time in\n               our modern society, color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the\n               enlightened mind and space. color is seen as corrupting, intoxicating, disorienting\n               and in art, has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch. We went from\n               times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white\n               were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence.\n               What is the significance for this preference for black and white when it comes to\n               high art? Why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our\n               space? What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more\n               specifically can black and white be considered non-colors? \n            Ever since the dawn of man, human society has evolved in ways which attempt to\n               ultimately control nature. Seeing as color is something of the natural world, age\n               old and archaic, washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above\n               the physical world. \u201cIntelligent beings have a language represented by articulate\n               sounds; organized beings, like all animals and vegetables, express themselves by\n               cries or forms, contour or carriage. Inorganic nature has only the language of\n               color. It is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or\n               emerald\u2026 color, then, is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature,\n               while drawing becomes the medium of expression, more and more dominant, the higher we\n               rise in the scale of being\u201d(Blanc, Chromophobia, p.25). The history of color is\n               about the ways in which man has tried to find the ideal state of being throughout the\n               ages. \n            In the Far East, reaching a state of colorless-ness is associated with the highest\n               state of spiritual being, the state of Zen. What is typical of this sort of ascetism\n               is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal. This is\n               apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and\n               Japan. For them, reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in\n               its most minimal form. This reduction of color and expression proved the purity the\n               artist had reached within himself, it was a means of reducing down to the essence of\n               a thing. \n            In the Elimination of color in the Far East, Izutsu explains though how this\n               ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine\n               knowledge of color. \u201cThis artistic acestism, i.e., the suppression of externals and\n               the reduction of all colors to black and white, manifests its real aesthetic\n               function only against the background of a highly refined sensibility for colors and\n               their subtle hues. In other words, the true profundity of the beauty of black and\n               white is disclosed only to those eyes that are able to appreciate the splendors of\n               sumptuous and glowing colors with all their delicate shades and tints\u201d(Izutsu, p.\n               169). For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of\n               color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors\n               in themselves as non-colors. \n            It is through the absence of color that one brings to mind the colors that are no\n               longer present. It is up to the mind to fill in the blank space. Without color one\n               could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space. colorlessness needs\n               color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place. \u201cThat is to say,\n               under the total absence of color, there is a vague reminiscence of all colors that\n               have been \u201ckilled\u201d(Izutsu, p. 177). Black and white are the consummation of all\n               colors into one. \u201cBlack is life; it is the infinite possibility of expression and\n               development. Black here is not sheer black. For in it\u2019s negation of all colors, all\n               colors are positively affirmed\u201d(Izutsu, p. 193). It is through these means that one\n               finds the essence in a thing. \n            In Western society, this purging of color began with the rejection of ideals of\n               generations past. Eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the\n               18th century. Society turned to minimalism as a way of cleansing life, representing\n               modernity. color became a moral issue, seen as something sensuous and dangerous in\n               its secondary nature to the essence of life and form. \u201cThe predominance of color at\n               the expense of drawing is a usurpation of the relative over the absolute, of fleeting\n               appearance over permanent form, of physical impression over the empire of the\n               soul\u201d(Chromophobia, p. 28). color rests on the surface of an object, it is\n               superficial, cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that\n               thing. \n            color is associated with the Fall from Grace. It is something which speaks to the\n               senses, not the mind, it is external and therefore secondary to life. It deals with\n               the body, emotions, not the intellect. It strays from reason in the way which it\n               consumes and manipulates life. \u201ccolor was a permanent internal threat, an\n               ever-present inner other which, if unleashed, would be the ruin of everything, the\n               fall of culture. For [Charles Blanc] color also represents a kind of ruination.\n               color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization, the\n               nobility of the human spirit, slowly, heroically, has lifted itself \u2013 but back into\n               which it could always slide\u201d(Chromophobia, p. 23). It is a descent in the way it\n               makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire, and to\n               desire is to lose control over oneself. Thus, began the cult of the black and white. \n            White is seen as representing spirituality, the heavens, and light, it is all which\n               is modern, it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color. It is the\n               control of nature, and the body and represents the modern man. \n            \u201cWHITE is the spiritual color of our times, the clearness which directs all out\n               actions. It is neither grey white, nor vory white, but pure white. \n            WHITE is the color of modern times, the color which dissipates a whole era; our era\n               is perfection, purity, certitude.\n            WHITE It includes everything.\n            We have superceded both the \u2018brown\u2019 of decadence and classiscm and the \u2018blue\u2019 of\n               divisionism, the cult of the blue ky, the gods with green beards and the\n               spectrum.\n            WHITE pure white.\u201d(Chromophobia, p. 47). \n            For these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of\n               colors. Abolishing color means controlling color. \u201cThe white surface exposes\n               color, presents it for disciplining. It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames.\n               But before that, it keeps an eye on itself, watching its freshly laundered and neatly\n               folded fabric for the stain of color\u201d(Wigly, p. 151). colorlessness is not natural,\n               and thus proves man\u2019s superiority over this world. \n            On the other hand, we need color in order to distinguish black and white. Just as\n               those from the Far East, the purity of white implies what has been washed away and\n               thus makes the white glitter even more. White and black stand out because of color,\n               and color stand out because of white and black. They are linked intrinsically\n               together, one cannot go without the other. \u201cWhite is the setting for color.. In a\n               mosque for example, the architectonic effect of its white garment is assisted by a\n               strategic use of color: \u201cAll these things are clothed in a majestic coat of\n               whitewash. The forms stand out clearly; the impeccable construction displays all its\n               boldness. At times a high stylobate of delightful ceramic produces a blue vibration.\u201d\n               The sensuous vibration of the color clarifies the white surface whose limit it\n               marks\u201d(Wigley, p. 209). We need this opposition between color and \u2018non-color\u2019 to make\n               distinction between the two, otherwise neither would hold such significance. White\n               helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash, it brings together and unites.\n               \u201cWhite expresses a certain incorporeality. The use of white is therefore decisive for\n               the bodily appearance of a space. Concrete bodies decrease the space more or less\n               depending on their color value. Against white, one can actually establish the\n               intensity of clashing colors; white determines the tone in the first place. Because\n               of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize\u201d(Wigley,\n               p. 311). \n            For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and\n               architectural spaces. The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set\n               before them. It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours\n               of the space. \u201cIn the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and\n               disposition was surest and most convincing, all the details of the form and color of\n               the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background\u2026In this a\n               form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could\n               be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in \u201cclosed\u201d\n               spaces\u201d(Wigley, p. 313). \n            There is another important aspect which white is representative of, and that is the\n               well educated and socially elite. In the 19th century it became fashionable for\n               bourgeois women to dress in white, while men dressed in black (Wigley). These\n               distinctions proved a certain rational order, only attained by those able to afford\n               of it. White walls, white clothing, they both require much more maintenance than\n               something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors. Crisp\n               whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury, and leisure. White clothing\n               proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work,\n               for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women\n               who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white, while men who were the ones\n               to go out and work wore black, for black did in fact hide stains. \n            The same goes with white walls, in their impeccability it proved to whoever, that the\n               owner could afford to not live actually live in this space, or could afford more\n               simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint. Both as well were signs of\n               the modern age man had reached. \u201cPure white was de rigueur, partly because of its\n               exciting novelty, partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture, and\n               pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature\u201d(Wigley, p. xvii). The use of\n               white was proof that man had conquered nature. \n            The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of\n               distinguishing oneself from the vulgar, normal, lower classes. \u201c..it is also worthy\n               of remark, that savage nations, uneducated people, and children have a great\n               predilection for vivid colors; that animals are excited to rage by certain colors;\n               that people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the objects that are\n               about them, and seem inclined to banish them altogether from their\n               presence\u201d(Chromophobia, p. 112). Furthermore, with the advent of industrialization\n               the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for\n               all classes. Now, anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began\n               to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them. \n            Thus said, the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new\n               bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the\n               vulgarity from the low. \u201cIn the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie, there\n               long survived a tendency to limit the use of color, with strong emphasis on what are\n               generally thought of as non colors, such as white, black and gray\u201d(The Style Engine,\n               p. 40). Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in\n               black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession\n               with purity and cleanliness. Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of\n               labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing\n               of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so. This simplicity of dress\n               was seen as a mark of the modern man. \n            Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on\n               this preference for black and white. Photography took over as a means of portraiture\n               for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to\n               color the photographs, for the most part they were left in black and white because it\n               was seen as more \u201cnatural\u201d. Above all, it is believed that the expanse of literacy\n               and the printed word, mainly the newspaper, had a profound effect in influencing the\n               choice of black and white. \u201cThis world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform,\n               a world in \u201cblack and white\u201d. This led to the idea of writing = rationality =\n               production that confined images, especially images in color, to the emerging field of\n               \u201cart\u201d, which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially\n               unproductive, while it assigned to the two-toned and orderly world of printed paper\n               the role of a daily guide to existence\u201d(The Style Engine, p. 42). The world of print\n               was therefore seen as something serious for the modern man. \n            Black and white became a symbol for the superiority of man\u2019s intellect and\n               technology. This then translated down into the world of fashion, as seen with the\n               distinction between black and white clothing, as well as art, namely photography but\n               also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space. \n            Seeing as since the time of Aristotle, form was valued over that of color, the arts\n               which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form.\n               The explosion of mass production and printing allowed for a plethora of colorful\n               advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch. \u201cKitsch is a product\n               of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America\n               and established what is called universal literacy\u201d(Greenberg). In order to meet the\n               demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the\n               attention of consumers. Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it\n               reproduced it d infinitum. Greenberg continues by saying, \u201cKitsch, using for raw\n               material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and\n               cultivates this insensibility. It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical\n               and operates by formulas. Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch\n               changes according to style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all\n               that is spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its\n               customers except their money -- not even their time\u201d. With the advent of kitsch came\n               a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms. Avant guard at\n               the time was considered to be true art, while this kitsch was simply pure imitation. \n            Thus said, this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the\n               cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious, high art,\n               while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes.\n               Of course during the early stages of color film and photography, the quality was so\n               poor that it gave a cheap look, whereas black and white film really allowed one to\n               see the light and the shadows in the images. For the play of light and form was key\n               in demonstrating the true art form. That was what made up the essence of an image,\n               not the artificial, or superficial filling in of form with color. Color was thought\n               to distract the viewer from the soul of the image. \n            These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being\n               almost better than reality. Still though black and white is seen as something of a\n               more sober tradition. Photographers still use black and white and white is still the\n               most widely used color for walls within gallery spaces. These non colors allow for\n               the appreciation of color. When something is black and white, it allows the mind to\n               fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen.\n               Many actually complained with the invention of color in movies that this stunted the\n               mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors placed before them. It is for\n               this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an\n               intellectual process. It forces one to imagine, it forces one to delve into the core\n               of the object. Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non\n               color, the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years.\n               Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color, but perhaps it\n               is human instinct, to want to surpass and rebel against generations before, so\n               possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration. Thus is the ebb and\n               flow of life. \n\n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "Black_and_white", "class": "essays"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/essays/Homosexuality", "text": "\n   \n      \n         \n            The debate over homosexuality has been one of the most long-lasting and controversial\n               ones ever. What, exactly, causes homosexuality? Some would say it is a gene, passed\n               on from parents to child. Others would argue that it is a result of a child\u2019s\n               upbringing. Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be\n               cured. Perhaps then, it is a combination of some of these? No one knows for sure, and\n               it is possible no one ever will, but that surely does not stop everyone from coming\n               up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter.\n            Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of\n               the time, where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence (Emond).\n               In his book The Symposium, Plato wrote \u201cThose who are halves of a man whole pursue\n               males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood,\n               and take pleasure in physical contact with men\u201d (qtd. in Isay 11). This shows that\n               not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male, he\n               also believed that it began at a very young age, as the word \u201cboyhood\u201d signifies. In\n               fact, Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only\n               \u201creal and lasting love\u201d and necessary for democracy. Furthermore, there were many\n               occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology; Hercules is rumored to have\n               had 14 male lovers, and Zeus himself partook in such behavior. Even Homer wrote about\n               Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love\n               (Emond).\n            But it was not until 1869 that the term \u201chomosexual\u201d was first used, to describe \u201ca\n               man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex\u201d\n               (Marcus 1). (However, for the purposes of this paper, homosexuality will be looked at\n               solely in terms of men). At this point in time, Karl Maria Kertbeny used the word in\n               a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of Prussia.\n               Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for \u201csame\u201d and the Latin word for\n               \u201csex,\u201d whereas a heterosexual is a person\u201d whose feelings of sexual attraction are\n               for the opposite sex\u201d (Marcus 1).\n            It was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was\n               started by Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician, sex researcher, leading sexologist,\n               homosexual, and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany, who believed\n               that homosexuality was biological in nature (Marcus 10). Hirschfeld also founded the\n               Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in 1897. The\n               committee published many books and other forms of literature, which gave Hirschfeld a\n               great amount of prestige in his field. He became known as one of the founding fathers\n               of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world\u2019s first sexological\n               institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed\n               by the Nazis 15 years later. Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl\n               Ulrichs, with minor additions; he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of\n               homosexuality, but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to \u201ccure\u201d homosexuals with\n               the use of hormone injections. This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned\n               to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs,\n               starting in1864. The first, Vindex, defended Urnings, while the second, Inclusa,\n               which followed shortly after, described the first scientific theory of homoerotic\n               desire. Ulrichs believed that Urnings were attracted to other males because they were\n               \u201chermaphrodites of the mind,\u201d meaning while they may have been male in body, they\n               were female in soul and mind, leading them to be naturally attracted to males in\n               terms of sexual partners. This, he claimed, made laws such as paragraph 175, a law\n               adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their\n               unification which forbade sex between males, and forced criminal penalties upon\n               individuals partaking in such behavior, unfair and unreasonable . Ulrichs claimed\n               that the origin of such a disposition was natural and inborn (Wikholm).\n            A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer, Sigmund Freud still believed\n               homosexuality to be a natural behavior. In an interview in 1903, he professed his\n               beliefs: \u201cI am\u2026 of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick\n               people\u2026 Homosexual persons are not sick. They also do not belong in a court of law!\u201d\n               (qtd. in Isay 3). In 1935, he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous \u201cLetter\n               to an American Mother\u201d of a homosexual, which stated that \u201cHomosexuality is assuredly\n               no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be\n               classified as an illness\u2026 Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern\n               times have been homosexuals\u201d (qtd. in Isay 3).\n            However, the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s, including the medical\n               professionals, regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness. Treatments such as\n               castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted\n               cures. By the mid 1900s, psychotherapy became the most common \u201ccure,\u201d and many\n               homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual\n               preference (Dudley 125).\n            Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a heterosexual psychologist, conducted a ground-breaking study in\n               the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud. In this courageous\n               experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual\n               and half heterosexual. She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that\n               homosexuality was a mental illness, and concluded that there was no significant\n               psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men; \u201cgay\u201d men were no\n               more insane than their \u201cstraight\u201d counterparts (Marcus 183).\n            Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an\n               illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who\n               has been referred to as \u201cthe Rosa Parks of the gay movement\u201d convinced the American\n               Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the\n               Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973. Just over\n               a year later, the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from\n               their list of mental illnesses (Marcus 11). The American Psychological Association\n               further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of\n               Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual\n               Orientation in 1997, which publicly chastised those who attempted to \u201ccure\u201d\n               homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment. It stated, rather that\n               homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person,\n               but must still be respected as an individual orientation, and thus treated as one\n               (Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation).\n            Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael\n               Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard\n               Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of\n               Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics. For\n               two years, these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both\n               monozygotic, or identical twins (a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg\n               and thus having identical DNA), and dizygotic, or fraternal twins (a set of twins\n               from too separate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than\n               that of two ordinary siblings), in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males\n               (meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment). In\n               total, 110 pairs of twins (identical and fraternal) and 142 sets of male and their\n               adopted brothers were studied, where at least one of the two had been classified as\n               homosexual, either by self-identification or other means. Out of the 56 homosexual\n               males who had identical twins, 29, or approximately 52 % of their identical twin\n               brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only 12, or approximately\n               22 % of the 54 non-identical twins of homosexual males, and 6, or approximately 11 %\n               of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of\n               genetics. Strangely enough, the study also included pairs of biological brothers that\n               were not twins, and out of the 142 homosexual males studied, only 14, or about 9 %,\n               had homosexual brothers, which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of\n               homosexuality in the general population (Bailey & Pillard).\n            More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a \u201cchoice,\u201d\n               but rather a feeling that one is born with. As one grows older, they become aware of\n               sexual feelings towards other persons. The only difference between homosexuals and\n               heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite\n               sex, homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex. Therefore, neither\n               homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a \u201cchoice\u201d in the matter, and asking a\n               homosexual \u201cWhy are you attracted to other members of your sex\u201d is likened to asking\n               a heterosexual \u201cWhy are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?\u201d After all, why\n               would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle? As a homosexual, one risks horrifying\n               their parents, other family members, and friends to the point of losing all contact\n               with them, ruining their career, being condemned by their religion, being beat up for\n               publicly displaying their sexuality, and much much more. Rather, the only actual\n               choice is whether or not to be open with one\u2019s sexuality and sexual preference;\n               whether to act on one\u2019s sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings,\n               or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions (Marcus\n               9).\n            To supplement my findings from research, I have conducted personal interviews with\n               two adolescent homosexual males, James Dobbens and Daniel Woods. Both were asked how\n               what they thought determined homosexuality (nature vs. nurture) and why, when they\n               realized they were homosexual and how they knew, and similar questions. Both believed\n               that homosexual was a result of nature, rather than nurture (Dobbens & Woods).\n               Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual;\n               \u201cThey\u2019re not like \u2018My child\u2019s going to be gay!\u201d\u2019 (Dobbens). Dobbens believes that he\n               was born homosexual. When why he was a homosexual, he explained \u201cIt\u2019s just the way\n               you are, you can\u2019t explain it, I was just born that way, it\u2019s like asking how the\n               world was made \u2013 no one really knows\u201d (Dobbens). He went on to explain that while his\n               nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it. When\n               discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child\u2019s sexuality, he commented\n               \u201cThey can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don\u2019t bring\n               you up [to be a homosexual]\u2026 I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted],\n               so that\u2019s why I\u2019m so open about being gay; I accept myself\u2026 [Whether or not you\n               accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends\n               on how you\u2019re brought up\u201d (Dobbens). Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and\n               justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one\u2019s nature, rather than\n               nurture, when he commented that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to\n               anything like [homosexuality]\u201d (Woods). When asked why he was gay, he explained that\n               it is simply \u201csomething that I can\u2019t help\u2026 embedded in my head; nothing made me do\n               it\u201d (Woods). He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction\n               between males and females, only it was between males and other males. He added that\n               \u201cnothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it\u2019s always been there. I\u2019ve always been\n               attracted to guys\u201d (Woods). What I find to be extraordinary about Woods\u2019 case is that\n               he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys, he is\n               romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend\n               and to be close with other females, etc\u2026 but never in a sexual sense. Though he has\n               \u201calways kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],\u201d these feelings come\n               from his \u201cromantic side, which is different from the sexual side\u201d (Woods). He says\n               that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust, maybe he could work\n               it out. He then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic;\n               \u201cIt\u2019s like race. It\u2019s all something you can\u2019t help; it all comes to you\u2026 It\u2019s\n               internal, you can\u2019t help it\u201d (Woods). When asked if he thought homosexuality was\n               caused by a gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct. He\n               gave the example of birds, which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build\n               a next, or catch their prey. Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something\n               in the development of the embryo. All in all, Woods views homosexuality as\n               \u201cfascinating.\u201d His final thought: \u201cI also believe everyone has at least one\n               homosexual attraction. It\u2019s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it\u2019s a\n               spectrum\u201d (Woods).\n            Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics. According to\n               Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection, the advantageous traits are passed on, while\n               the disadvantageous ones eventually die out. For instance, heterosexual males have an\n               average of five times as many children as homosexual ones, as a female is required to\n               reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to\n               females. Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of\n               the disadvantageous traits. Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five\n               times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool, if homosexuality was\n               indeed caused by a gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been\n               reduced immensely in the number of occurrences. Since neither of these events have\n               yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene\n               (Fulkerson).\n            My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no\n               definitive answer on what causes homosexuality. No one knows for sure now (although\n               many think they do), and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth. Nonetheless,\n               I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of\n               genetic and environmental causes. Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition\n               towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations. However this\n               does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be\n               triggered by environmental factors. This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their\n               study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same\n               genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality, this was not the case 100 % of\n               the time. This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write\n               this, new studies are being done. Perhaps the truth is right around the corner.\n            \n               Works Cited \n               APA Online. 2003.

Two quintessential novellas, \u201cThe Lust of the White\n               Serpant\u201d from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \u201cEternal\n               Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\u201d a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively\n               complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a\n               more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal.\n               While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of\n               this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme\n               fatale\u2019s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it.\n            Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and\n               initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life\n               force out of her human husband.\n                  Lai, Whalen. \"From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking \"Madame White\n                     Snake\".\" Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52.\n                But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona\n               of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal\n               Confucian wife, particularly in \u201cPagoda\u201d. Whalen Lai notes, \u201cShe was a loving wife, a\n               caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a\n               general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female,\n               particularly forbearance\u201d.\n                  Ibid., 53.\n                But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her\n               human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key.\n            Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern\n               Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian\n               wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of\n               the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The\n               earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century\n                  Oxford English Dictionary, \u201cFemme, \u201d Oxford University Press,\n                     http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3\n               ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her\n               incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to\n               their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White\n               snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in\n               \u201cLust of the White Serpant\u201d cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and\n               dreams of her, and finds himself \u201cdisturbed and agitated\u201d by her \u201cethereal\n                  beauty\u201d.\n                  Ueda, Akinari.

Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations.\n                     Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358.\n                Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting\n               that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction.\n            In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White\n               Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir\n               femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective,\n               Christine Gledhill writes \u201cNot only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman\n               is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine\u2019s characterisation is itself fractured so\n               that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale]\n               stereotype or not\u201d.\n                  Christine Gledhill, \u201cKlute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,\u201d\n                     in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press,\n                     2004), 81.\n                While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently\n               within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the\n               evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure\n               villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because\n               there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband\n               as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and\n               deceives him about her supernatural nature.\n            The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent\n               of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame\n               White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man,\n               and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the\n               expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so\n               that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White\n               Snake\u2019s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually\n               rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this\n               further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female\n               beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them\n               from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake\u2019s\n               lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In\n               \u201cLust,\u201d the priest informs Toyoo \u201cThose creatures took advantage of your fair looks\n               and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell\n               victim to their temporary form\u201d \n                  Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178.\n               . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not\n               fall for the Lady\u2019s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere?\n               If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil\n               character.\n            Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy\n               for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and\n               loyalty: \u201cI searched everywhere, and now that at last I\u2019ve found you, I\u2019m very\n                  happy,\u201d\n                  Ibid.,173.\n                she gushes to him in \u201cLust.\u201d Readers must also acknowledge that her human\n               lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, \u201cWe\n               have a love bond between us, as constant as the T\u2019ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea,\n               and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me\n               back, and let\u2019s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn\u2019t that be\n                  wonderful?\u201d\n                  \u201cEternal Prisoner,\u201d 369.\n                In another traditional vernacular story, \u201cTsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box\n               in Anger,\n                  \u201cTu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,\u201d trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W.\n                     Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations.\n                     Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358.\n               \u201d the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and\n               suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was\n               valued on the man\u2019s part as well as a woman\u2019s. So her husband\u2019s failure to follow\n               through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for\n               her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake\u2019s plight. \n            However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the\n               story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long\n               tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon\n               destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White\n               Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or\n               later, a Buddhist monk\n                  Lai, 53.\n                would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story\n               might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and\n               would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her\n               crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give\n               readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of\n               the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the\n               death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions\n               themselves. \n            In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the\n               strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly\n               imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, \u201cthe final \u2018lesson\u2019 of the myth\n               often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong,\n               unrepressed (if destructive) woman.\u201d\n                  Janey Place, \u201cWomen in Film Noir\u201d in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan\n                     (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48.\n                In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on\n               in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the\n               sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. \n            This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it\n               is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these\n               stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female\n               character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in\n               the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against\n               the patriarchy.\n                  Lai, 52.\n                Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine\n               in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too\n               Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly\n               outside the bounds of conventional social expectations. \n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "Madame_White_Snake", "class": "essays"}

On that date Jennings\n            Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company\u2019s Campbell\n            Works would close. Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people\n            of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster. Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the\n            people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and\n            villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills. \n            The events that would follow this\n            date (known as Black Monday) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage\n            and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope. Rather than sit back and wait for their\n            jobs to be snatched away, the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able\n            to keep the factories open. Petitions, protests, rallies, collectivization, and even the takeover of a steel\n            company\u2019s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the\n            only source of employment that this town had. These well-intentioned efforts ultimately failed, leaving\n            thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind. \n            But why did the\n            brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail? When\n            examining the area\u2019s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal\n            of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union\u2019s Youngstown\n            branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual\n            initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between\n            different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union\n            leaders to save the industry. Most importantly, the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem. Although\n            it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply\n            could not solve a national crisis on a local level. \n            \n            A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio\n\nIn 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as\nPoland Township. Their blast furnace, \u201cHopewell,\u201d was the very first blast furnace in the area. During the Civil War,\nYoungstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products. Youngstown also was a major railway\ncrossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago. In fact, \u201cMore rail\ncars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the\ncountry.\u201d\n\nDuring the 19th century, the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast\n(Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania) to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast, including the Mahoning\nValley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky. By 1880, Youngstown\u2019s population had grown to nearly 16,000,\nwhich meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period. The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of\nimmigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills. This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when\nthe Great Depression hit the area hard. Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization\u2019s successful efforts to\nestablish a national steel workers\u2019 union, the industry barely survived the Depression years. Finally, the outbreak of\nthe Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill\ninto a fast-paced period of booming growth.\n\nYoungstown may have been an important and prosperous region in the post-war period, but the seeds for its downfall\nwere slowly being sown. Strikes racked the town during the forties, fifties, and sixties, and they were often long and\nbloody. In 1973, the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed. This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering\nworkers and driving productivity and laborer morale down. At the same time, stricter governmental standards for\nenvironmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel\nparts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies\u2019 stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie.\nMost importantly, Youngstown\u2019s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive. Old technology was\nnot replaced, obsolete methods were not updated, and almost none of the industry\u2019s profits were being utilized to help\nmodernize. It was a recipe for disaster that would soon explode in the faces of hundreds of thousands of workers and\ntheir families.\n\nBlack Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry\nThe announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the\nentire valley into chaos and ruin. Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000\njobs were lost countywide. Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade\nthe powers that be to reconsider their statement. However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd\nMcBride, \u201cIf you can\u2019t make a buck, you get out of the business.\u201d\n\n\nThe closings meant the end of Youngstown\u2019s only real industry, the end of its population growth, and then end of\neconomic progress. Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas\nof the country. Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn\u2019t afford to move mostly ended up on the\nstreets. Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably. It was becoming increasingly clear\nthat without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited\nby those too poor or hopeful to escape. The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they\nmobilized in a variety of ways.\n\nAttempts to Save the Mills\n\nThe very first thing that the workers could do was \u201cto get up a petition to stop the shutdown,\u201d says Ed Mann, a local\nunion leader and organizer.  The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then\ngiven to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington. However, the representatives were shunted to\nthe side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown\u2019s political influence had died with its industry.\n\nThe International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union\nmembers. The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure.\n\nNext, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded\nthe attempt to reopen the Youngstown works. The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of\nworkers might purchase the mill and run it collectively. Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again\nto the federal government. Here, too, they were ignored. The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they\ncould do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed. \nFinally, following the shutdown of US Steel\u2019s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel\nHeadquarters in Youngstown. They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the\nHeadquarters and took it over. The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready\nto talk about selling the mill. Immediately after the workers left the building, US steel representatives told the local\nunion leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the\nmill.\n\nAll these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown\u2019s steel mills remained closed. These attempts to save\nthe mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American\nsteel impossible to sell or export.\n\nThe Decline of the World Market\nThe efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up. During\nWorld War II the rest of the world was hungry for America\u2019s iron and steel products; however, by the seventies no\nforeign nations needed to import steel in such large quantities. In fact, American steel imports were beginning to\noutweigh exports.\n\nForeign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel. Foreign\nsteel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often. This meant\nthat foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America, and therefore were able to export a\nmore competitive product.\n\nForeign steel was also much cheaper. Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers\nin the US, made American steel far more expensive. Also, international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap\nlabor. Jobs were scarce in other steel-exporting countries, and labor laws were either non-existent or allowed employers\nto pay much less for work. Labor costs in America continued to go up, draining US companies of their resources, while\ncompanies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities.\n\nOn a worldwide scale, newer materials such as aluminum, plastic, and composites were beginning to substitute steel\nboth at home and abroad. Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline, and it affected both domestic and foreign\ncompanies. However, to American companies already suffering financial setbacks, outdated machinery, and fierce\ncompetition, this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford. America\u2019s steel remained unsold, flooding\nthe world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy.\n\nSince this problem was a national one rather than a local one, the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were\nnot unique. Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry, but it was not\nalone. The problem was a national one, involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown\u2019s alone. J. Philip Richley,\na union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills, has summed it up thus: \u201cYou just can\u2019t solve a\nnation-wide problem in a single city.\u201d The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the\nentire steel community in America. Trying to prop up one city\u2019s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that\nspread throughout the entire industry.\n\nThe Save Our Valley Campaign: Lack of Funds and Plans\nEventually, some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and\nformer steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign. As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to\ninstill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and\nowners and help secure the future of the region. Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help\nstimulate the Campaign and rally the people.\nBut the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding. The people of Youngstown, being now\nunemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive. College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all\nhad to come before donations to non-profit organizations. People outside of the area had no personal investment in the\nmills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds. The lack of money proved\nto be crippling, because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively. Without\nfunds, the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city\u2019s dying economy.\n\nThe Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component: an actual concrete plan. No one seemed to know\njust how to go about fixing the problems. Letters and petitions were all very well, but they did little to improve the\nsituation. People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would\nwork; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general.\nBeyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped\nforward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down.\nWithout a real plan, nothing could truly be achieved.\n\nWithout funds to drive the efforts, or even a real plan of action, the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than\ngood. In effect, it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything. People became excited\nand waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did. The Campaign failed to save any jobs and Youngstown was\nplunged into economic chaos.\n\nThe Apathy of USWA\n\nUnited Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit.\nInitially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs. However, it\nsoon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight, the international branch was not. The\nhigher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight, attempting to shut out the\nappeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening.\n\nActually, one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do. No one\nhad ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before, and none of the leaders of USWA, not even president Lynn\nWilliams, knew what could be done. It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings\nwould be one of the worst in US history, and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered. Rather\nthan try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that\nperhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had.\n\nBesides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism.\nObviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that the federal government might see\nthe efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism. If the\nUSWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the\ngovernment (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders\nwere encouraging socialism. This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its\npeople, something they could not afford to do. Therefore, they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch\nfight it out alone.\n\nRegionalism\n\nFrom its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets. Youngstown is the\nname of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are\nindistinguishable from the main city itself. Boardman, Poland Township, Struthers, Lowellville, Warren, Lordstown,\nCanfield, Niles, and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown (see Figure 3). People from each town\nwork, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other\ntown. However, although traffic is heavy between each separate district, each area has its own distinct cultural\nethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food. For example, Struthers is a poor town with a large\nSlovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and\npollution is widespread. Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist. Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a\nwell-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools. Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman\nCatholic, with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side. Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding\ntowns, and the streets are clean and well kept. With many more cultures, religions, and economic levels living in close\nproximity to one another, a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area: regionalism. Each town, with their own identity,\ninstills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and\ninteractions between populations. Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain\ntowns becoming sworn enemies of others.\n\nWith so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would\nsave their jobs and their futures. Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from\nCampbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be\nworking towards the same thing. A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement, because no one was\nwilling to put aside regional differences to work together. In some instances, small companies would express interest in\nhelping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree\nwhere the new businesses should relocate. In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for\nnew industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional\npride.\n\nConclusion: The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday\n \nBlack Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people. The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact\nwere unsuccessful for four main reasons: the failure of the international steel market, the lack of funds and plans in\ninitiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of\nineptitude and fear, and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope\nfor brining in new companies.\n\nWhat happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level, and perhaps it\nis not. But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves\nthrough their economic, political, and social futures. Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence, hundreds of\npeople were uprooted, forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities. Hundreds more joined the unemployment\nlines, or even began living on the streets. For the people of Youngstown, Black Monday was not just a historical event-\nit was the most important event in their lives.\n\n\nThe steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something\nwhich would endure long after they had moved away and moved on. Even though they eventually failed, the fact that they\ntried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives\nand the futures of their children.\n\n              \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "Ohio_Steel", "class": "essays"}

She was tall, graceful, pretty, and interacted well with people. She wore stylish, trendy clothes, and was the one that people strived to please. Priscilla was adored by the teachers, and she knew how to get what she wanted. Though she acted kindly and refrained from malicious acts of meaness most of the time, she still had a slice of vanity in her essence. She didn\u2019t quite fancy the idea of spending time with anyone deemed unpopular or stupid. Occasionally, she would volunteer her time for charity, but she didn\u2019t work the hardest. Yet whenever she did even the slightest good deed, a newspaper reporter always happened to be around. Despite the fact that she was deemed an intelligent beauty by many, and as much as she was one, the amazing truth still stood. As much as it appeared, she wasn\u2019t the greatest, or the purest, prettiest, or bravest. There was another who was all of this and so much more. Someday, all would see this.\n\n\nCocooned\nStovohobo\n2008-11-09T18:04:41Z\nID: 45731\nPrequels: 45697\n\nSequels: 45737\n\n\nContoured metallic parts glided and folded out over me, emerging from the wall and pushing me back in with them.

When the barge landed on the opposite bank of the terrible Styx, Psyche clutched the cake she would need for the next horror. A few yards in front of her, growling and snarling, Cerberus sat with trails of drool hanging from his teeth. She tossed him the cake, picked up her skirts, and sped past his huge figure. Persephone herself was kind enough, for the wife of the King of the Dead. She thanked Psyche for coming down, filled a box with cosmetics for Aphrodite, and sent Psyche on her way.

I wanted no more war, but I was afraid that more may follow. As if reading my thoughts, Arenn turned and looked deep into my eyes.\u201cYou, child,\u201d she said, beckoning to me. My heart pounding, I slowly walked towards her. Odd, but I had never thought of our leader as beautiful before, only sly. Now she seemed to have the beauty of a raven silently flying overhead, an ebony silhouette against the fire-red sky. \u201cChild,\u201d she said again, \u201cWhy do you frown so? Are you not happy to be released after so many long years of imprisonment?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d I said, but even as I said so my frown grew deeper.

I guarded the person known as Alice Black for a year and a day in her youth at the orders of the former Queen of Midnight, came with her to live at the Night Palace in Amaron, and stood by as the Queen of Midnight instructed her in the ways of the old order.

Alice had never been happy being the daughter of two of the Days. She regarded them- her parents, and all the days, in fact- with a semblance of disdain. The night was the only thing that interested her. She was secretive. Two days before her 13th birthday, her parents, Dawn and Morning Tea, as she called her mother, took her to the Wayward Diviner, as was customary for children of the Days. The Wayward Diviner had no doubt in his mind. He told Alice\u2019s parents who she was to be the heir of as soon as they walked through the door. But they didn\u2019t believe him. They told him to spin the Bone Wheel, so they could see for themselves. They thought he had made a mistake. The Diviner makes no mistakes. Thirteen times the wheel went round, only to confirm his words. Alice was the Midnight Heir.\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "1400", "class": "ficlets"}

No one can stop it, or detour it from its set course. All one can do is sit and listen to the tale as it plays out on a screen much larger than those of the theater. A story filled with adventure, conquest, agony, and relief descends upon this land, Amair. We the faithful people of his highness must follow the rules set for us by royal law. We mustn\u2019t and can\u2019t allow our foolish hearts to divert our attention. That is the fate of those who live in this land, and that is how it has always been. Until today, when a girl with a fiery disposition and a strong heart shall rebel against the empire, change the hearts of the city people, and bring defeat down upon his royal highness. This strong willed girl will fight harder than any soldier ever has and will release her homeland from its suffering, and forever leave her name in glory, Rain.\n\n\nMy World\nArtist_Girl\n2008-11-10T18:34:20Z\nID: 45805\nPrequels: 45577\n\nSequels: none\n\n\nSandra shrank down the hallway, folding her shoulders over her torso.

It was a cold day in November, and the only sign of life was the wind, hissing between the brown grasses and the lifeless tree branches. The ground was littered with shriveled leaves that occasionally were lifted by the wind to travel several feet before dropping back to the dull grass. At first I thought that the winged shape in the sky was a sparrow, and I was glad that a bird had come out, for it was lonely with just the hissing wind for company. But as it descended, it grew larger. It was a goose. No, all the geese had left for the winter, and it was too large now. What was it? An eagle? Could it be? No, it was too large, and it\u2019s wings weren\u2019t open. It wasn\u2019t descending with control, but falling. The creature was the flapping wildly, trying to regain flight, but it still fell, falling, falling, down to earth.\n\n\nEagle's Beak\nThyme Passing\n2008-11-11T10:53:56Z\nID: 45853\nPrequels: 45852\n\nSequels: 45854\n\n\nIt crashed loudly into the branches of the leafless apple tree, splintering wood and screaming aloud. It sounded like a hawk\u2019s cry, it did. I ran towards it. It was an angel! An angel, cast down from the heavens and fallen to the earth. It\u2019s big brown wings were twisted, and it was horribly cut from where it crashed into the tree, and yet it\u2019s crashing into the tree very well might have saved its life, for the tree slowed its fall enough so that when it fell out of the tree, it was not hurt as badly as it would have been if it had landed on the cold, hard ground first. I ran up to it, filled first with excitement and then with concern. It was moaning, and occasionally it uttered a lamenting phrase in some incomprehensible language, and tears ran down its face. I saw that instead of a normal nose and mouth, it had a curved bird\u2019s beak, of the sort that eagles have. I knelt beside it, not sure if I should move it inside, or if moving it might just injure it more.\n\n\nThe Bonesetter\nThyme Passing\n2008-11-11T11:18:34Z\nID: 45854\nPrequels: 45853\n\nSequels: 45855\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I said softly to the injured angel. The Bonesetter would know what to do. I stood and ran briskly across the field to the road. The Bonesetter lived not far away from my house, in a once-colorful gypsy caravan where he did his work. As a child, I had been terrified of the caravan, partly because the Bonesetter growled and snapped at the village children, but also because of the blood-curdling screams that came from inside when people were having their broken bones set, so they would heal properly. Breathless, I arrived at the caravan door, and knocked sharply upon it. I knew that the Bonesetter would not answer unless it was an emergency, so I kept knocking until he opened the door and snarled, \u201cWhat is it you want that you must make such a racket on my door?\u201d \u201cYou must come,\u201d I said, gasping. \u201cIt\u2019s hurt.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t treat animals,\u201d he said, starting to close the door.

The Bonesetter had splinted both its broken arm and wing, and bandaged its various cuts with all the skill he possessed, but the angel had fallen asleep, and hadn\u2019t awoken until the second day, when my ginger cat, Andante, climbed onto the angel\u2019s chest and fell asleep. The angel\u2019s eyes fluttered opened, a startling green. Weren\u2019t angels supposed to have blue eyes? The angel murmured and clacked something to itself in its soft, precise language, and stroked the cat with its unbroken hand, smiling. Andante purred happily at the attention. \u201cGood morning,\u201d I said, with not a little amount of awe. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d The angel cocked its head, and looked at me with a sad comprehension. It said something in its language that I could not understand.\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said. The angel frowned. It murmured a few more things to itself, in various languages, and then chanced upon English.\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d it said, and I saw tears in its green eyes.\n\n\nKamila Duche, heir to the Rouvelin Throne\nlovinglife307\n2008-11-11T12:51:34Z\nID: 45856\nPrequels: none\n\nSequels: 45875\n\n\nThe necklace hung to just below her collarbone, and the pendant rested on her chest.

Do not expect me to lament the fate of their civilization, for it was at my hands did it fall. The plan was of my weaving. Being their servant, I knew all their secrets, but they never suspected me, for I was meek, and small. What could a human do against a giant? they asked themselves. They never guessed my treachery! I laugh at their folly. I was subtle and sly. Through my cunning did the giants turn against each other. The man doubted his wife, and the woman questioned her son. None of them knew, and so they directed their anger at all, and so undid themselves. Soldiers plundered the homes of their own people, and the people rebelled. At the last, when the multitudes besieged the City, only then did I reveal my plot, and by then it was too late, for the City was burning.

It was a text from Jared. \u201cim comin home now so we can hang out\u201d\n\n\nNot Your Typical Rescue\nMackizme\n2008-11-11T16:11:31Z\nID: 45871\nPrequels: 45868\n\nSequels: 45872\n\n\nWarm hands turn him over. His eyes are frozen closed, and he moans softly at the touch. He is barely conscious as the hands pick him up and carry him...somewhere. He can occasionally make out some voices, but only snippets of conversation. He is drifting in and out of consciousness.\n\u201d....in the truck....hurt.......needs heat....\u201d \u201d....him home...\u201d \u201cI know!\u201d This last comment is louder than the rest and his eyes flutter open and catch a glimpse of a girl....a beautiful girl. And then he is asleep again.\nHe awakens in water. Warm water. Someone is rubbing his arms with soapy hands. \u201cWha...?\u201d he murmurs. The light is bright. Suddenly the lights dim and he is able to fully open his eyes.\nTom is astonished to find himself sitting in a white porcelain bathtub. He suddenly realizes something is touching his leg. No. Not just his leg, but his back as well. All at once the realization comes, and then he hears a voice speak into his ear from behind.\n\u201cHello, Tom. Not to worry, I\u2019ll keep you safe and warm.\u201d\n\n\nA Long Lost Memory is Found\nMackizme\n2008-11-11T16:22:57Z\nID: 45872\nPrequels: 45871\n\nSequels: 45874\n\n\nHis instinct makes him stiffen at the touch of a girl, but immediately he relaxes as she reaches around him and begins to massage his adolescent, hairless chest. She moves up his arms and onto his shoulders, murmuring softly the whole time. He can\u2019t help but give up control. He lets his head loll back onto her shoulder, closing his eyes and moaning in pleasure. He is very aware that her breasts are pressed against his back.\nSuddenly her hands are moving downward. She grips him by the waist and hoists him back toward her. Instinctively he moves with her and grabs her hand. She squeezes it, and with the other hand begins to explore his thighs and the space between.\nHe gasps, his eyes wide open now. Something in her touch has reawakened a long lost memory and he is turned on. The water is soothing and he moves with her, tuning into the rhythm of her moving hand, his mind elsewhere... in the past.\nHe is imagining that day long ago when that very special person did the same thing... and he fell in love.\n\n\nExperiment No. 1\nStovohobo\n2008-11-11T16:30:05Z\nID: 45873\nPrequels: 45759\n\nSequels: 45884\n\n\nA few more hours crept by, one by one, with nothing happening. I occupied myself by pacing the tile and gazing out at the Chicago skyline, then finally sitting down and listen to my stomach purr with hunger.\nFinally, a noise came through and broke the silence. But it wasn\u2019t a voice, it was...just a mechanical noise.\nSuddenly the entire floor underneath me groaned and creaked, tipping to a nearly forty degree angle. I yelled out and skidded down the slick marble floor, eyes widening as I realized the whole thing was hurtling me straight for one of the glass windows. The soles of my feet nearly burned off from the friction I made trying to stop myself.\nI closed my eyes, and the explosion of glass reached my ears. Shards ripped at my clothing, hundred mile-per-hour winds immediately shooting me out into the opening, spinning me around and around until -\nDark. Light. My fingers felt cold stone underneath them. I opened my eyes.\nTiled marble floor lay underneath me.\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "1403", "class": "ficlets"}

He wished Roy wouldn't fall for that gag every time, \"get me a big rock, Roy.\" Roy stooped to pick up a big, white caliche rock that looked like a dirty lump of chalk and handed it to Chad. Chad took the rock with disgust as Roy returned to staring at his shoes. Chad was six, and at eight Roy should have been teasing or ordering Chad around or something. But since his fall the year before, Roy had been shuffling and doing what he was told. Chad strained and pounded the rock into the iron hole until he could smell the dust. It smelled like first grade. He wished he were there now, even if he did have to sit next to Roy. The rock was too big to fit into the iron hub of the big cable spool, so Chad leaned it against the tumbleweed and slid down off the splintery wood on his belly to admire his handiwork. \n         The fort was a lone, wooden cable spool like a tall barrel with thick disks on its ends, each the size of a dinner table. Several boards were missing, making a door to the small room inside. The tall tumbleweed flag marked it as Chad's to defend now. He looked around, trying not to seem nervous. \n         The sky met the flat ground in all directions on the other side of the chain link fence. Chad checked the other fort out of the corner of his eye. Two forts stood on the playground, and a hot, bare battlefield separated them. A massive, rusted A-frame swing marked the border though nobody was swinging in the hot sun. The larger of the two forts was a squat black bunker made of tires, two big tractor tires capped with one from a truck and two smaller ones from cars. The older boys lay around in shade and napped inside the walls. They were watching now from well defended spy holes, or maybe they were performing secret experiments and swearing bloody oaths. Chad wished he were old enough to be one of them. Maybe Tucker would let him in after he saw Chad wasn't chicken. \n         \"You wanna play robots?\" Roy asked. Chad felt his heart beat a little faster and his cheeks burned. He had invented the \"robots\" game to make fun of Roy, but Roy had never figured that out either. It was Roy's favorite game. \n         \"No, go get some stickers.\" Roy shuffled off without argument, his baseball cap pulled low to cover his bald head and brain plug and his shoe laces untied. Roy had taught him to tie his shoes when Chad was five. He thought about gathering stickers himself. Roy was too slow, but he didn't dare step away from his fort. He took another careful look over his shoulder and bent to pluck a yucca spear as if that were what drew his interest. The long blade of the yucca had a sharp tip, but the only weapons allowed according to Humpty Dumpty Nursery rules of engagement were smelly thistles or cocklebur stems covered with spiked yellow stickers. The tiny barbs hurt, but nobody was allowed to beat you up if you just used stickers. The hot August sun was settling toward the time that Mrs. Rayburn would bring the milk tray out of the cinder block building where the toddlers and babies were kept. The older boys wouldn't wait much longer before attacking. \n         Meanwhile Roy stalked around the fence edge bending to pick cockleburs as he went. Every move Roy made since the accident was smooth and sudden and strange -- like a remote control boy. When he saw Roy in the hospital with a shaved head and the small silver plug at the back of his noggin like a bottle cap, Chad had called him, \"Remote Control Boy.\" Momma had smacked Chad for saying it which hurt, and then she had cried, which was worse. Pop had given Chad the sideways glance that promised hard labor when they made it home. Chad just hung his head. He knew it was too late to explain that he was trying to get a smile out of Roy. \n         Pop said, \"The doctors have put something very special in Roy's brain. It's something they made for soldiers and astronauts and it's going to help Roy walk and talk to us again.\" Pop put a hand on Roy's shoulder. \"How are you feeling, Roy?\" Pop spoke slowly and Chad knew that he must have been practicing this with Roy. They all stood around while the doctor made Roy shake and jerk and moan with a sick sound. But the thing in his head hadn't worked yet because of something having to do with the, \"electric toads,\" which wouldn't, \"sit up.\" Roy didn't really start talking for days and didn't walk until a long time after that. Now, this year, Roy was in the same grade as Chad, and it was embarrassing. \n         Roy stepped around the edge of the building and out of sight. Just then Tucker Williams came climbing out of the top of the black fort like a gold headed monster. Tucker was big, even for a third grader, and he was not quite right in a different way than Roy. Tucker was the oldest boy in the playground, and the one who decided the rules of the game. \n         \"Time out!\" Chad called, \"We're not ready yet.\" \n         \"No time outs!\" Tucker shouted and continued to climb down the tires. Several more boys spewed out after him. \n         \"Roy!\" Chad called, but his voice would only whisper. He didn't want to be a crybaby, Tucker hated crybabies. The rules of the game were that Chad had to keep everyone away from his fort and away from his tumbleweed flag. From painful experience, he knew it wasn't going to be as easy as just pretending he was too slow or too weak to do anything. Tucker liked to hit and he liked to see blood. Going down too easy would only make him mad, so Chad reached behind him to grab the five stickers he had managed to collect before the start of the game and readied himself. \n         The boys came in quick from all sides, knocking Chad down, but he managed to roll to his feet and get one sticker off into a boy's arm before being knocked down again. \n         \"Baby!\" Tucker was standing over him with the huge tumbleweed held high in the sun. \"Penis! You didn't fight!\" \n         Chad tried to tell his arms to lift him and let him reach for the tumbleweed to prove he wasn't a baby to Tucker. But as much as he wanted to appease the scary, staring, angry boy, he couldn't move for fear of what was coming next. \n         \"I'll make you fight.\" Tucker leaned in low and his breath was sour as it blew in Chad's face. \"I'm gonna take the plug out.\" Then Tucker's face became serious. The awesomeness of what he intended pulling his eyes wider still. From his pocket he pulled a small screwdriver, perfect for prying plugs from boy's heads. \n         Now Chad's legs and arms and mouth worked, and he was up and running and screaming, \"Roy, go inside! Roy!\" He sprinted for the corner of the building around which Roy had disappeared. The door was on that side and Mrs. Rayburn. Just then a horrible pain stung Chad's cheek and neck and ear. The tumbleweed's yellow thorned branches scratched around him as it dug into his face. Tucker made a grab for him but missed it, and Chad heard his shirt rip a little. He ran like only a small boy can run, but he was losing and he wished hard that he could fly. \n         \"Roy!\" Chad rounded the corner grabbing the cinder block to help him turn faster just as Tucker came down again with the tumbleweed from behind, and the world slowed almost to a stop. \n         Roy stood with the bill of his cap down. His head rose and his eyes focused over Chad's shoulder. Roy held stickers in his hand like flowers, but he bent looking down and snatched something from the ground. His hand blurred and snapped out as he stood back up. Something whined as it spun past Chad's ear, and he heard a sharp, meaty thunk just behind him. \n         Roy stood expressionless as ever as Chad turned to look. Tucker towered there with a surprised expression and crossed eyes, the tumbleweed in one hand and the screwdriver held up high in the other ready to stab down into Chad's back. A sharp, flat, flint rock split Tucker's forehead and was buried deep and solid like a part of a Halloween costume complete with a drop of blood just starting down toward his nose. \n         Tucker dropped down like a jacket from a hook. He lay folded over his own lap in a way that made Chad think of broken things. \n         \"You ok?\" It was Roy, and when Chad looked up there was something like his brother there around the eyes. \n         \"Yeah.\" Chad stepped back away from Tucker's open-eyed face. \"He was gonna take off your head plug.\" \n         \"I thought he might stab you.\" Roy said and craned his neck forward to look at Tucker's face as the other boys began to crowd around at a respectful distance. \"Do you think he's dead?\" \n         Just then Tucker blinked and began to sob. \"Nah.\" Chad said, \"We're gonna be in trouble.\" \n         \"Yeah.\" Roy said. Then he shrugged. Suddenly his blank face seemed like the face of a Play Force Soldier or a GI Joe. \n         \"Hey, Roy?\" \n         \"What?\" \n         \"You suck.\" Chad finished the formula, but this time, he didn't mind that Roy fell for it. It was all right. \n         \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "cable_spool_fort", "class": "fiction"}

It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent\n                    so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to\n                    preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he\n                    stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept\n                    her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent\n                    the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us\n                    little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we\n                    begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. \n                 When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their\n                    apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home,\n                    where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when\n                    I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a\n                    sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close\n                    to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing\n                    up that symbol of their love for me. \n                 The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they\n                    were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill\n                    myself that night. \n            \n            \n                Let me begin again. \n            \n            \n                 I like life on the resort worlds -- always have and, after the upcoming\n                    mindwipe, always will. Last year, I rented a small house on Vega IV, a sea\n                    world, all islands and reefs and archipelagos, turquoise waters and aquamarine\n                    skies, sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova. There's\n                    only one city: called Nuevo Acapulco in La Enciclopedia del Empirio de la\n                    Humanidad, it's N'apulco to the locals. The N'apulcans are mostly emigrants from\n                    Polaris II; the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is\n                    that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists. Now the N'apulcans profit from their\n                    Hispanic siblings. \n                 I don't mean to sound cynical. I suppose I wish to show that I'm still capable\n                    of a certain authorial distance, a semblance of dispassionate observation. The\n                    following events may indicate otherwise. \n                 In fine tourist tradition, most homes on Vega IV are named. Mine was The\n                    Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink. Were they\n                    mood-sensitive, they would have changed as I first viewed them. The rental\n                    agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive\n                    either. She said, \"It's beautiful, isn't it, Se\u00f1or Flynn?\" \n                 My instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat\n                    and take me elsewhere. But she was young and attractive (as I have said and may\n                    say again) and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn\n                    that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism. And then, because a\n                    playwright cannot resist a promising line, I said, \"Your Sleeping Flamingo\n                    should be put to sleep.\" \n                 To say her face fell would do a disservice to Tasha and to literature. (Allow me\n                    my self-indulgences as you would those of a dying man -- when I convince my\n                    mindsmith to permit the wipe, there will be another Bernardo Flynn, one who\n                    knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here.) Her brows drew\n                    together, creasing the lovely, caramel-colored skin around her eyes and showing\n                    the pattern for an old woman's wrinkles on her forehead. Her lower lip (a trifle\n                    too narrow for her face, perhaps her only physical flaw) thrust forward slightly\n                    as she started to speak. She caught herself, slid her jaw infinitesimally back\n                    into place, and said, \"You don't like it?\" \n                 I laughed. What could I do? I clapped her shoulder to show I was not laughing at\n                    her. \"Like it? I hate it, despise it, abhor it! It's gaudy, graceless,\n                    pretentious -- That house is an affront to taste and intelligence. I should buy\n                    it to raze it, but I am not so kind-hearted. I might, however, rent it.\" \n                 I think she only heard the last words of my speech. \"You will?\" \n                 \"It amuses me. Show me around, and then I shall decide.\" \n                 \"Of course, Se\u00f1or Flynn.\" \n                 \"And stop calling me 'se\u00f1or'. Not even Los Mundos is so polite. Call me\n                    Bernardo.\" \n                 \"If you wish.\" \n                 \"I beg you, change the color of the walls, at the very least.\" \n                 \"But of course!\" The house walls shifted from pink to lavender. \n                 I stared. \n                 \"How's that?\" \n                 I looked at her. \n                 \"Worse?\" \n                 I nodded. \"I would not have thought it possible.\" \n                 She frowned. \"It is rather ugly.\" \n                 \"Thoroughly ugly,\" I corrected with smile. \n                 \"Obscenely ugly,\" said she, smiling too. \n                 \"No.\" I pointed. \"It has no tower.\" \n                 \"I can fix that.\" She reached for another dial on the house controls. \n                 \"Don't you dare!\" Her wrist, when I grabbed it, was smooth and strong and warm\n                    in my fingers. \"I'll take it. Exactly as it is.\" \n                 \"You will?\" \n                 \"I must. God knows what you might do to it next.\" Reluctantly, I released her\n                    hand. \n                 The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise. Cloudwood had been used in\n                    a Mediterranean manner, making the house seem primitive and civilized at the\n                    same time. The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired. From the\n                    living room, the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that Tasha\n                    asked if I felt ill. All I could say was, \"No. I'm in love.\" We both thought I\n                    referred to the vista. \n            \n            \n                 It's strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life,\n                    forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one\n                    would remember, and suddenly the forgotten, in revenge, rears up to savage the\n                    unwary. So it was as I wrote the preceding. My heart convulsed, and I left this\n                    manuscript for a three-day spree. Apparently I was so successful that it lasted\n                    a week and a half. Not bad for an eighty-three-year-old, even for one who has\n                    his rejuve every month. And if I can brag and digress so easily, this must not\n                    be painful enough to merit a mindwipe, yes? \n                 No. I abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately,\n                    thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them,\n                    even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight. My mindsmith is not\n                    so understanding. She says I am emotionally a child, to which I reply, \"Of\n                    course. Why else would I come to you?\" This logic does not soothe her; she says\n                    I must wait three weeks. Three!. Such is the law. I say I do not care about law,\n                    I care about service and she should care about money. Enough. I went on a spree,\n                    and it must have been a good one. I hope the wipe is as successful with my time\n                    on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here. I dimly remember three bedpartners\n                    who were probably human, and one that I hope was delirium. I will not answer the\n                    phone for a week, no matter whose face appears on it. \n                 I keep evading the issue. But which issue? The issue of why I am evading the\n                    issue, or the issue itself? To deal with the first: it hurts to remember. If I\n                    am capable of love, I loved Tasha Cortez. If I am not, I had the perfect mirror\n                    for my narcissism. \n                 As for the issue itself, I'm no longer sure what I want to record. The\n                    playwright in me wants every scene of our time together. The editor says no,\n                    only those that are relevant. The sufferer says no, only those which cause no\n                    pain. And the artist says no, only those which cause the most pain, for those\n                    would be the truest memories. \n                 So I shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise. I will not talk of the\n                    first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together. I can remember\n                    similar things with others. Tasha's witchery lay in making old acts new. Is that\n                    love? Probably not. But it is something marvelous and rare, which is surely a\n                    sign of love. \n                 If my love for her was the only important thing, I would leave a holo of her\n                    with a note: \"Dear Future, this is Tasha Cortez. You loved her. With warmest\n                    regards, Your Past.\" \n                 Enough. Tasha and I walked through The Sleeping Flamingo together, and I decided\n                    to buy it. Then -- \n            \n            \n                 This is not easy. I stand up, I walk around, I pretend someone makes a vid about\n                    a writer and I must enact every cliche. I cannot decide what's important. But I\n                    have learned something: writing trivializes. The Tasha who was is not the Tasha\n                    in this file. The Tasha in this file is not even the Tasha I loved and thought I\n                    knew. The Tasha in this file would walk through a net show in half an hour,\n                    including commercials, and just before an ad for Figuero's Flash Diapers --\n                    Keeps Baby Driest!, she -- \n                 Tasha is not the whole of what happened on Vega IV. I must also write about\n                    Emiliano Gabriel Malaquez. \n            \n            \n                 Future Self, you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between\n                    the last sentence and this. Not another spree --at least, not like the other. I\n                    have been re-reading all our favorite books -- \n                 But neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects, do we? \n                 I want to pick up with Tasha and me walking about The Sleeping Flamingo, and\n                    then, for the sake of literary convenience, to say that from a corner of the\n                    yard I saw a neighboring house, and the sight filled me with darkest\n                    forebodings. But the truth is that Tasha pointed it out from the one place where\n                    it could barely be seen, and I only felt envy that it had been designed by\n                    someone with understated good taste. \"Who lives there?\" I asked. \n                 \"No one,\" Tasha replied. \n                 Truth is always more boring than fiction. For Malaquez did not move into Dream's\n                    End until four or five months after I -- we? how does one speak to one's future\n                    self? -- occupied The Flamingo. \n                 I do not plan to write a book: this narrative must move more quickly. Tasha and\n                    I became lovers that evening, after a good dinner of paella at her apartment. I\n                    made some small joke afterward, about approving of her firm's business\n                    incentives, and she cried. Consoling her, I began to suspect I loved her. I\n                    moved into The Flamingo the next day; and she gave up her apartment three weeks\n                    later to join me. It was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most\n                    people believe it does not happen at all, the sort of romance that sustains the\n                    hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love. (Which is to\n                    say, you and me, Future Self.) \n                 Who was Tasha Cortez? She was a twenty-four-year-old (Terran Standard) N'Apulcan\n                    who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunt's real estate\n                    firm. Her family said she did it to support her father, who was dying of a\n                    particularly painful degenerative disease. Tasha said she woke up one morning\n                    convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables, she would become\n                    one. \n                 She did not like my plays. I had impressed her because I was famous and amusing\n                    and not, as I had hoped, because I was a great artist. That bothered (yes, and\n                    intrigued) me until I realized that she was bored by most plays, movies, and\n                    vid. She did not like being a spectator. I often told her that she should have a\n                    bio-check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance. I often told her\n                    too many things. \n                 Search \"Emiliano Malaquez\" and you'll find he's a master of the \"captured\n                    moment\" school of sculpture. Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work.\n                    To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living\n                    models. He accents the illusion of reality --I paraphrase his entry in La\n                    Enciclopedia Humanica --by doing life-size scenes in \"the full round,\" never the\n                    easier frontal or three-quarters view. Moreover, he never did portraits of\n                    famous people; his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared\n                    to it. As is typical of his school, his pieces are sealed in stopboxes. The\n                    shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we're looking at an\n                    instant snatched from under the hooves of time. They say the cubes will outlast\n                    planets and suns, that when the universe dies, the works of Malaquez and his\n                    followers will be the last things seen in the final wink of God's eye. \n                 Yes, Self, I am also bothered that this observation ignores half-eaten cheese\n                    sandwiches, incomplete insect collections, and locks of infants' hair, forgotten\n                    in closets, basements, and warehouses. \n                 You see the inspiration for my latest play, \"Captured Moments.\" The mindwipe\n                    will take its creation from my future self --but time too often does that\n                    without aid. The play's second act concludes with the last fight between Tasha\n                    and me. I have disguised us in the play, and deleted one brief melodramatic\n                    interchange. Now I will mention it, in case I/You decide to restore it. Shortly\n                    before she left, Tasha said, \"You steal from life for art, Bernardo. You'll\n                    impoverish yourself.\" I only snarled at her and -- \n                 My story leaps ahead of itself. Let me retreat and retrench: \n                 One night during N'apulco's mild winter, Tasha returned to The Flamingo, saying,\n                    \"Nardo! Nardo! Guess what?\" \n                 My mind was on other things. \"You wish to become pregnant? I suppose I could\n                    assist a friend. Purely for the sake of the race, of course --\" \n                 \"Ever the altruist. Still, if I do decide, we could practice --\" \n                 Later, I said, \"You've been chosen to succeed the Emperor.\" \n                 \"What?\" \n                 \"My guess.\" \n                 She batted at my nose like a cat. \"Silly Nardo.\" \n                 \"Then I give up.\" \n                 \"Emil Malaquez is buying the house up the hill.\" \n                 \"Oh.\" \n                 \"You don't know who he is?\" \n                 \"Well...\" \n                 \"Nardo!\" One of the many things I liked about her was that she often thought me\n                    shockingly ignorant. \n                 \"That's, uh...\" I am never so quick-witted in person as I am on the page.\n                    Especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant. \n                 \"You know, the sculptor. He's had shows in Brazil and New Madrid and everywhere!\n                    He may be more famous than you.\" \n                 \"Imagine that.\" I remembered an article in The Medusa and a photo of a work in\n                    which 100-peso notes fell like confetti onto a small Undersider, sexlessly young\n                    in grimy, oversized clothing. The child's face was a warground for wonder and\n                    mistrust. Imprisoned light from forgotten streetlamps snagged itself on metal\n                    threads in the fluttering pesos. The stars themselves might have fallen on the\n                    Undersider and the event would have been no less strange, no less miraculous. \"A\n                    great artist will grace this world, then?\" \n                 \"Nardo!\" She was never tolerant of my ego. \n                 \"Well. What's this more-famous-than-me person like?\" \n                 \"I didn't meet him, jealous old one.\" \n                 \"Too bad. If I thought he could free me from you --\" \n                 \"Hah!\" She wrapped her arms around my stomach. \"You'll never be free of me, old\n                    man!\" \n                 The next evening, she arrived with a stack of glistening stopboxes containing\n                    sushi, sashimi, oysters in their shells, and Terran vegetables fresh plucked\n                    from their hydroponic beds. Wondering about the reason for her extravagance, I\n                    asked how work had gone that day. \n                 \"Emil came in. He's taking Dream's End.\" \n                 \"Emil?\" \n                 \"You've no memory left, old one. Emil Malaquez.\" \n                 \"Ah. You did that to test my affections.\" \n                 \"What?\" \n                 \"Calling him by his first name. I did that in a comedy once.'Nights with Karl\n                    and Groucho.' It was before your time.\" \n                 \"Oh.\" \n                 \"The critics liked it.\" \n                 \"I'm glad.\" A moment later: \"That's not why I called him 'Emil'.\" \n                 \"No?\" \n                 \"No. We lunched together. He's nice.\" \n                 \"Oh.\" \n                 \"It wasn't like that.\" \n                 \"You're free.\" \n                 \"Of course. Still, it wasn't like that. You think I sleep with every famous\n                    person I meet?\" \n                 As you may have guessed, we had talked about such things. I do not claim ours\n                    was a perfect affair, only a wonderful one. \n                 \"Tasha --\" \n                 \"Do you?\" \n                 \"No.\" \n                 \"Good. I invited him to dinner tomorrow.\" \n                 \"Oh?\" \n                 \"He'll be our neighbor. You say we're becoming too insular, that we need to\n                    socialize --\" \n                 \"I've socialized for sixty-three years.\" \n                 \"Nardo?\" \n                 \"Yes?\" \n                 \"How should I reply?\" Her voice had grown quiet, and I began to feel some guilt.\n                    I had, it is true, told her that we needed other company than our own. I said\n                    this from years of learning that romances consume themselves without other fuel.\n                    But knowing this did not mean I wanted it. \n                 I said, \"Truthfully.\" It was the statement of a younger and crueler man than I. \n                 She screamed, \"I haven't socialized with Terra's elite for most of my life! I\n                    haven't socialized with hardly anyone for hardly any of my life! And I invite a\n                    neighbor, one nice, lonely man --\" \n                 \"I'm sorry.\" \n                 \" --who took me to -- What?\" \n                 \"I'm sorry. Truly.\" \n                 \"Oh.\" She studied me as a suspicious puppy might, then said, \"I'm sorry, too.\" \n                 \"I suppose I sound like I'm bragging when I talk of the things I'm tired of.\" \n                 \"Only because you are.\" She smiled. \n                 I had to grin, so I did. \"True.\" \n                 \"He may come to dinner?\" \n                 \"If you wish, he may be dinner.\" \n                 \"I love you.\" \n                 \"And I, you.\" Months earlier, we might have sought a bed, a couch, or a\n                    comfortable chair at this point. Instead, I asked, \"Is he handsome?\" \n                 \"You're jealous.\" \n                 \"A tiny bit. Extremely.\" \n                 \"Content yourself, old one. He's four inches shorter than I, his nose is big and\n                    broken, and --\" \n                 \"This is cosmetic?\" \n                 \"He's not that ugly. I think they're his natural features.\" \n                 \"Interesting.\" \n                 \"You could write a play about someone like him.\" \n                 \"Perhaps.\" \n                 \"I think his face is his form of vanity. It's the reverse of you with those\n                    ridiculous stomach muscles. Old men should be fat.\" \n                 \"Is Emil?\" \n                 \"Yes.\" \n                 \"I am jealous. I'll eat two dinners tonight. Five deserts.\" \n                 She giggled. And then we did make love. \n            \n            \n\n                 I've been thinking about the mindwipe, now two days away. Who said that those\n                    who forget the past are doomed to repeat it? I fear that may be true for me. Add\n                    this to the reasons I write now: to remember something, perhaps even to learn -- \n                 Emil Malaquez arrived after sundown, carrying a small package wrapped in what\n                    looked like real paper. His evening dress was formal, expensive, and slightly\n                    stained, as that of all forgetful artists should be. He was a jovial man with an\n                    easy laugh, and even uglier than Tasha had suggested. I liked him immediately. \n                 \"Se\u00f1or Malaquez?\" \n                 \"Please. Call me Emil. You must be Bernardo. Tasha's told me much about you.\" \n                 \"All of it outrageous praise?\" \n                 \"All of it.\" \n                 \"Ah, she is wonderfully perceptive.\" \n                 He raised an eyebrow, then guffawed. \"Has she said as much about me?\" \n                 \"She thinks you are a genius. Do come in.\" \n                 \"Thank you.\" Stepping into the living room, he said, \"A beautiful house.\" \n                 \"I'm glad you came after dark.\" \n                 Tasha, by accident or design, had found an innocently erotic posture on the\n                    couch, where she lay with a book of M'duvian prints. \"Emil!\" She leapt up. \"I\n                    did not expect you --\" \n                 \"So early?\" \n                 \" --on time. It's unforgiveable, but you're forgiven.\" She nodded at the\n                    package. \"What's that?\" \n                 \"For your kindness in inviting a stranger into your home.\" He held it out, and\n                    with a delighted \"Oh!\" Tasha snatched it from him to rip away the paper. \n            \n            \n                 I stopped writing, and only the thought that I might miss the mindwipe kept me\n                    from another spree. I went walking, but after N'apulco, Rio seems no fit abode\n                    for a creature of flesh. I walked from this hotel to the old city, past the end\n                    of the slidewalks and softwalks to the hard, cracked pavement of City Park. But\n                    Undersiders left me alone. Perhaps they recognized a fellow ghost. So I\n                    returned, and slept, and now the mindwipe is thirteen hours away. \n            \n            \n                 The side of Malaquez's parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen\n                    of solid air. Bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a\n                    friend or a bringer of food. Tasha oohed in awe. I said, \"Frodo's been visiting\n                    you, eh?\" \n                 Malaquez said, \"Your pet?\" \n                 \"Hardly. He lives around here somewhere. I suppose he was attracted to the\n                    commotion up the hill.\" \n                 \"Ah,\" Malaquez said. \"Why 'Frodo'?\" \n                 Tasha said, \"A little fellow with big, furry feet. What else could he be\n                    called?\" She handed the sculpture to me. \n                 I almost dropped it; I expected it to weigh no more than a holo. \"Heavy,\" I\n                    said, as if he might not have known. \n                 He laughed. \"My last piece was of four old Undersiders crouched around a trash\n                    fire. Be glad someone didn't toss that to you.\" He spoke of his art with the\n                    enthusiasm of a seven-year-old. \"Um, I should wait to importune you, but...\" He\n                    grinned shyly. \"A confession, and then a request. And then you must forgive me\n                    for being so forward. It's not easy for me to ask a favor.\" \n                 \"Relax,\" I said. \"It's easy for me to turn one down.\" \n                 He glanced at me and decided I was joking. The surprising thing is that I was.\n                    \"Good. My last show --\" \n                 \" --was glorious!\" Tasha said. \n                 \" --was kindly received,\" he said. \"But an artist who would stay first among his\n                    fellows can tell when he begins to fail.\" \n                 \"Oh?\" I hoped no one would bring up my last three plays. \n                 \"I must change my subject matter. No more urchins, dopers, vagrants, or whores.\n                    I want to do more traditional portraits.\" He spoke quickly, prepared to be\n                    rejected. \"Would you permit me to do one of you? I would pay --\" \n                 \"Never,\" I said. \n                 \"Ah.\" He shrugged lightly. \n                 \"Nardo!\" Tasha said. \"It's an honor --\" \n                 \"Of course,\" I said. \"That's why I cannot take payment.\" \n                 \"Oh? Oh! Thank you!\" Malaquez turned to Tasha. \"And you as well? Perhaps the two\n                    of you together?\" \n                 Her eyes became circles at the idea of being, as she undoubtedly thought it,\n                    immortalized by Emil Malaquez. Catching herself, she said casually, \"Oh...\" And\n                    then she smiled, laughed loudly at herself in the way that always made me think\n                    how much I loved her, and said, \"My God, yes, yes, yes!\" For a perfect moment,\n                    Emil and Tasha and I were one entity, laughing until our lungs hurt. \n                 This is torture. I had not considered that I might not write to learn, but to\n                    punish myself. Let me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in\n                    a few sentences: After giving Emil full rights to a sculpture of Tasha and me,\n                    we had a good dinner of curried clam chowder, lobsters boiled on Terra and\n                    unstopped still steaming on N'Apulco, and cinnamon custard for desert. Then we\n                    went out for a late swim. \n                 I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had. Somehow, Tasha and I began\n                    to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can\n                    imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I\n                    once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I\n                    knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha.\n                    So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with\n                    fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do\n                    not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly\n                    curious may look at the last act of \"Captured Moments.\") I remember suggesting,\n                    with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major\n                    accomplishments. \n                 Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed. Tasha looked at me as if to say, \"I will.\"\n                    She said, \"I feel sorry for you, Nardo. I'll see Emil home.\" \n                 \"Yes,\" I said, \"Do that,\" and did not care what she did, or why. \n                 Emil asked, \"You're all right?\" I muttered something he must have interpreted as\n                    assent. They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight\n                    ripple on distant waves. Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself, I\n                    finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping\n                    Flamingo to drink myself to sleep. \n                 She had not come home when I woke in mid-morning. I waited, and drank a glass of\n                    MorningAfter and three cups of coffee, and wondered whether our affair could\n                    survive the events of the night, and whether I wanted it to. Perhaps I should\n                    have invited Emil to stay, but even then I knew that sex was not the problem\n                    between Tasha and me. The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between\n                    compromise and capitulation, between symbols and substance. Shortly before noon,\n                    I climbed the sandy path to Dream's End, rehearsing my apology, slowing only to\n                    pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet. \n                 Malaquez answered the door in blood-red pajamas and a black silk robe. Sixty\n                    years ago in a similar situation, I had broken my knuckles on someone's face. I\n                    merely said, \"Is Tasha here?\" \n                 He pursed his lips slightly, then nodded. \"Yes.\" \n                 \"May I see her?\" When he hesitated, I said, \"Last night was my fault. I hold it\n                    against neither of you. Please. Let me talk to her.\" \n                 \"I --\" \n                 \"Please.\" \n                 He looked me and at last said, \"Very well.\" \n                 We walked through his house in silence. It was as attractive and as impersonal\n                    as a decorator could arrange for tenants of unknown taste. A tall, narrow\n                    stopbox stood in the center of one room; sand trickled forever downward while\n                    beads of water splashed across the sand's path. If that was Malaquez's work, it\n                    was a very minor effort. But then, I was in no mood to consider art. I only\n                    wanted to despise the man who had slept with my lover. That was easier than\n                    despising myself. \n                 He paused before a bedroom door. \"I should go in first. To prepare her.\" \n                 I smiled. \"She handles surprise surprisingly well.\" \n                 \"What would it hurt?\" \n                 \"True. Go ahead. Tell her...\" I shrugged. \"Tell her I love her.\" \n                 He studied me, then said, \"I'm sorry things happened this way, Bernardo. I\n                    didn't anticipate last night --\" \n                 \"I'm very good at making things happen this way. But if Tasha will forgive me\n                    --\" \n                 He nodded, repeated, \"I am sorry,\" then slipped into the next room. I waited in\n                    the dark, carpeted hall. A warm breeze came from silent vents above me. I heard\n                    no voices until Malaquez said, \"Enter.\" \n                 I blinked when I opened the door. Sunlight filled Malaquez's bedroom. Tasha lay\n                    sprawled nude on a rumpled bed. Her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the\n                    bed's teak frame. She was looking slightly to my left, smiling with trust and\n                    satisfaction like one sexually content. Malaquez stood near her, pointing\n                    something at my chest. Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them, it\n                    shimmered around Tasha. \n                 The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great\n                    Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor. Malaquez was not prepared for me to\n                    react so quickly, or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not\n                    have, a gesture I would not make, a poignant moment of repentence, wonder,\n                    despair, or love. Had he been faster, he could have had rage. I threw a chair at\n                    him. As he fell, I scrambled onto him, my knees pinning his arms, my fingers\n                    probing his neck. \n                 I shouted, \"Where is she? Tell me, or I'll kill --\" \n                 He began to cry. \"She left. Earlier this morning --\" \n                 Her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed. I hit him with the back of my\n                    hand. \"Tell me, Malaquez.\" \n                 \"She wanted to be famous. She did! Now she will be.\" \n                 He seemed to expect me to understand. \"Where!\" I demanded, squeezing his throat\n                    until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture. \n                 I stared at the naked Tasha. Most of his story I have pieced together since, but\n                    I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy\n                    throat. He had made his name with a home capturador. He began with small animals\n                    and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders, people who would never be missed. Now\n                    he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me, and when someone came\n                    looking, he would say we had gone island-hopping in our windboat. Our boat would\n                    disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose. His\n                    story would stand in either case. \n                 I wanted him to tell me more, but he babbled, begging me to forgive him, to\n                    understand. I did not listen. I took the capturador, a matte black Tiempo\n                    Capturado, from his grip and studied it, not really thinking about it or\n                    Malaquez or Tasha. I think I was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was\n                    art, so we accepted it as art. Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that\n                    humanity made that would outlive our species. But I was probably only looking at\n                    my reflection in the capturador's lens. Had he said then that I should use it on\n                    myself, I might have. \n                 That moment passed. I looked at Malaquez. His eyes opened wider while we watched\n                    each other. His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound.\n                    I turned to touch the cube that was Tasha's crypt. She smiled in trust or\n                    pleasure or pride, an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever, and I could\n                    never know why. \n                 The controls of the capturador were more complex than those of a kitchen model,\n                    but I recognized the unstop tab. I could free Tasha. If I did, one of three\n                    things would happen. Most likely: she would be meat --there is a reason why\n                    stopboxes are most often used in kitchens. Less likely: she would live the rest\n                    of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug's. And the tiniest chance of\n                    all: she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil's bedroom, and then\n                    she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal. \n                 As I put my hand on the impervious surface of Tasha's stopbox, I heard Malaquez\n                    run for the door. \n                 It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we\n                    should hate. Know this, my future self: Thanks to us, Emil Malaquez's name will\n                    live as long as his masterpiece, \"A Self-Portrait: Anguish,\" endures. \n                 And Tasha? I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate.\n                    I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame; some\n                    critics already say \"Waking With Tasha\" is Malaquez's finest work. If science\n                    finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emil's art, perhaps the I who reads\n                    this file will know that my decision is wise. But I cannot stop thinking that I\n                    was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death. My fear is that she\n                    would live, and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez\n                    translated her into a thing that can be kept, admired, and loved. \n                 For in my way, I have done the same thing. \n                 I am ready for the mindwipe now. \n\n            \n        \n    \n", "mode": "written", "name": "captured_moments", "class": "fiction"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/fiction/easy_money", "text": "\n   \n      \n         Easy Money\n         by Bill Glover\n         Charles Acres called me on a Thursday afternoon, just like that. I hadn't seen him since high-school, maybe twenty years before, and we were never buddies in the first place. He said he had a \"business proposition\" for me. So I'm thinking \"Amway,\" and I said so. He sounded surprised and said no, he needed me to help him get rid of \"a large quantity of gold.\" I told him I'd meet him for coffee at the diner down the street at seven. I was there early.\n         \"Thank you for coming, Ed.\" he was already there, sitting in a booth, warming his hands on a cup of coffee. He looked like jerked meat on the bone. He was wearing a new jacket and snow boots, but he had on a Hawaiian shirt underneath and khaki shorts of all things. His tan was obviously deep and old, but it looked like a work tan, not the kind you get at the beach. His hands were thin and huge knuckled with obvious callouses.\n         \"So, the mining business is treating you pretty good, huh Charles?\" he wasn't the sort you'd call \"Chuck.\"\n         \"I'm a linguistics researcher, Ed.\" He took a sip and closed his eyes like the cheap cup of coffee was really something special. \"Well I was a researcher, and I taught a little at a community college.\" He set the cup down and looked straight at me for the first time. \"How's your um... business?\"\n         \"Fine.\" I waived down a waitress and ordered a cup of decaf and a slice of pie. I didn't like his tone much. \"So you sure you're not a cop, Charles?\" I stared him down until he flinched. As I did, I noticed just how tired he looked around the eyes. Charlie Boy had been working hard lately, I figured. I knew every cop in Fairport and quite a few of the state police in Iowa, and I couldn't see them bringing old Charles in as a ringer.\n         \"I'm not a cop.\" He sighed and went on in softer, sadder voice, \"I guess I'm a thief now.\"\n         \"Hold it.\" I looked around. Charles might be for real, but he was still going to get me in deep trouble. \"Let's make real clear right now that you were joking, buddy. Otherwise this conversation is over. I've got a parole officer to explain things to, and he wouldn't like that kinda talk.\"\n         \"Right. Right. Sorry.\" Charles looked out the window at the passing traffic push through dirty slush for awhile. \"Like I was saying. I'm a researcher, I've come into some valuable material that I would like to find a buyer for, and I don't want to have to explain myself to anyone.\"\n         The pie came and I waited until the waitress was gone, before going on, \"Why me?\"\n         \"You always seemed to have 'connections' in school,\" he shrugged. \"You were the first person who came to mind.\"\n         First person? Twenty years out of high school? If he pulled my leg any harder it was coming off. \"How much of this 'valuable material' are we talking about?\"\n         \"Four Hundred ounces for a start.\"\n         \"Four Hundred.\" I pulled out my palm phone and looked up a number. \"That's alot.\"\n         \"It's a very small part of what I have to sell.\" He drained the last of his cup and tossed some bills on the table. \"I'm staying in town. Let me show you something.\"\n         I thought about it and made a quick call, just telling a buddy that I was \"postponing our meeting,\" for a couple of hours, meaning he should come looking for me if I didn't show up. Charles might not look like much, but I hadn't made it through my life taking that kind of chance. I put away the cell and used the motion to cover checking the knife in my sleeve and used one leg to check the other in my sock. I had been an amateur magician for years. One of my best tricks was pulling a knife out of thin air. It never failed to amaze. \"Sure. Let's go,\" I said.\n         We took his rental car back to the motel where he was staying. The little desk was covered with large books filled with sticky notes, a pile of folders and papers and a laptop computer plugged into the phone line. There was only one chair, so I sat on the edge of the bed as he handed me a book open to a picture of some sort of stone tablet.\n         \"Rapa Nui,\" he said, \"Easter Island. This codex is one of the few remaining examples of a form of writing known as 'rongorongo.' For a long time no one was able to decipher it, although by deduction, Steven Fischer deciphered some of it in nineteen ninety four. He mostly read creation stories off objects like the 'Santiago Staff' which said things like, 'All the birds copulated with fish: There issued forth the sun.'But he ignored the inscriptions on skulls and the 'Birdman' statuette. It was those clues that started all of this.\" My small expectations shrank as he spoke. I didn't see much money in hieroglyphic porn. He talked on about people with long ears who built the big statues, the \"moai\" and people with short ears who conquered the people with long ears and ate them and how the short eared people didn't really know the secrets of the long ears and had pulled down all the moai statues and destroyed some of the tablets. And how the missionaries came and the converted natives had destroyed more. He flipped pages to another image, \"But notice something here in the arrangement of the moai. See here how they form a pattern, very similar to this?\" He pulled out a small leather diary and opened it to a yellowed page marked with yet another small sticky note. There was an ink drawing and writing in a tiny neat hand that I couldn't read from where I sat. I didn't see much resemblance except maybe there were about the same number of points in the cat's cradle thing in the diary and the number of dots on the map showing places where statues stood in a thin line around the coast of the island. \"This is the diary of a mysterious explorer named Samuel Curlew who investigated a Mound Builder site in this area in the early eighteen hundreds.\" He closed the little book and just about hugged it with satisfaction. \"I want to show you that mound. You know it was these very mounds that originally sparked my interest in history, archeology and then linguistics.\"\n         \"And this mound is where you found gold?\" I was confused enough I let the \"G word\" slip. Was this some crazy treasure hunt? Or maybe this guy was just a wacko who wanted to take me out on a dark road and kill me.\n         \"No, it's more complicated than that, but I need to show you the mound for you to understand.\" The drawings and the books seemed to wake him up. He was smiling now and his eyes weren't so tired.\n         I was having serious cash flow issues back then and had payments to make, so I said, \"yes,\" but my patience was running out.\n         It was dark as we left. The drive was shorter than I expected. We pulled up to a little asphalt parking spot in front of a historical marker. When he killed the headlights there was no light but moonlight and stars on a light dusting of snow. A low, black hill blocked the sky right in front of us. \"It's up here,\" he announced stepping over the cable fence and starting up the hill. We spent the next hour stomping around the hill while he said things like, \"it was right here.\"\n         My patience was long gone, and I was back in the car to warming up when Acres tapped on the window and told me he had found whatever he was looking for. We trudged back up the hill and he led me to little patch of ground with a stick poking up from it. It looked like a bamboo walking stick. \"This is it,\" he leaned down and motioned for me to look at something on the ground. I casually slid a knife into my palm just in case. \"See how the lines form the pattern in the journal, the same one as the moai.\"\n         \"So you drew this?\" I asked vaguely, slow to catch on.\n         He looked hurt and rapped on the ground with his finger. \"It's stone. Ancient.\" He stood up using the stick to help. For the first time he looked cold and stiff in his tourist gear, making me glad I was in a suit. \"Here stand beside me,\" he said. \"I'm not sure if I can take you with me so I need to show you the device.\"\n         \"Device?\" I expected him to pull out a gadget with blinking lights and was wondering which way to duck.\n         \"Trick, gesture. It's like sleight of hand.\" He wriggled his fingers and then blew on them. \"OK, watch and remember this. I'm going to do it in two parts, last part first so it won't take effect. Remember to reverse the two parts when you actually do it.\" Stunned I watched as he made several ridiculous passes with his hands paused and nodded then did a sort of sign language stutter of some sort. \"I learned this from a skull shard rongorongo, they aren't all writing language. Some are just a memory device.\"\n         \"Mnemonic.\" I muttered, which seemed to please him.\n         \"Yes. They help in remembering steps in a ritual or ceremonial gestures. There's a long history of Polynesian gesture and dance language. Now you do it.\" He smiled and I could see his teeth in the moonlight.\n         I wanted to slug him, but he had the keys to the car back and I figured I'd humor him while I figured out how to get them without violating my parole. I didn't have much trouble duplicating his hand waving even though I hadn't paid much attention. I even swapped the two parts as he had asked. I thought he was surprised at my dexterity when his jaw dropped, but he shouted, \"No!\" just before everything changed.\n         I was standing on a perfectly flat square of dark stone. For as far as I could see by a weak, gray light the stone stepped up and down making little hills and terraces and platforms. I seemed to be somewhere in the middle -- there was as much above as below. The sky was dull and featureless and overcast. The air smelled bad in some way I can't describe, and at my feet I could see the same design from the little journal and the mound carved into the rock. I was in shock. The blood pounded in my head, and I just stood there blinking and listening to a sort of ringing whine in my ears.\n         The next moment, Acres was there. Hands up in the same way mine were frozen. We just looked at each other. I guess, thinking back, I might have expected him to gloat, but the view was the kind of thing that humbles you, shuts your mouth. We just stood looking at each other for a little while, I don't know how long.\n         \"What is it?\" was all I could think to say.\n         Acres just shrugged. \"A place. I don't know. I think this whole thing,\" he waved his hand at the horizon, \"is one big machine. And the markers were carved later, not be whoever built it. The markers are places where it's safe to come here and leave.\"\n         \"Safe?\" I looked around. One thing this place didn't seem was safe.\n         \"Let me show you the rest.\" He started walking down the steps and around a corner. It would have taken plenty to surprise me after what I had already seen, but My jaw was banging against my shoelaces when I rounded that corner.\n         I'm not sure how something so big could have been hidden by that little turn in landscape, but maybe perspective doesn't work quite the same there. Glaring down at me from no more than twenty feet away was a grimacing, thirty foot tall black face with staring, blue and white eyes and it wore a ridiculous little hat. For some reason I thought of a giant clown face from a carnival ride, but it scared the hell out me. Acres stood beside it and somehow using him as a yardstick for the scale of the thing made it easier to see. It was a moai. He had a serious, sincere look on his face and he was pointing to the ground. \"This is what I wanted to show you.\"\n         I looked down and saw he was pointing to another marker just slightly different from the one we had just left. I was pretty rattled, but things fell together for me looking at the big statue, the Hawaiian shirt and the mark on the ground. \"Easter Island?\"\n         Acres nodded.\n         It was all too much for me so I focused on the part I could handle. \"So what does this have to do with gold?\"\n         \"You could step on that marker and make the gestures, the 'device,' and it would be like pushing a button in a very complex machine. You would end up on a small hill on Rapa Nui. You could step three feet to the right and do the same thing, and you would end up buried alive in a nearby rock face. But I know how to make it take me anywhere.\" He pulled a sheet of folded paper from his pocket and handed it to me. It read, \"Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, Status Report of U.S. Treasury-Owned Gold.\" He pointed to a row that read, \"Deep Storage: Fort Knox, KY.\"\n         I sucked in a whole lot of air. \"Anywhere?\"\n         \"Anywhere,\" he walked around the moai and came back wrestling with a big, heavy bar of gold. \"They only check deep storage once a year. Otherwise the vault is sealed.\"\n         \"Does anyone else know about this? How much is that?\"\n         \"No, they would have been on Rapa Nui if they knew, ready to stop me. This is the 400 ounces which I mentioned at the restaurant. About $150,000 dollars at this morning's rate.\"\n         I looked at the sheet in my hand. \"Deep Storage: Fort Knox, Ky.\" it read, \"147,341,858.382 Fine Troy Ounces, Book Value: $6,221,097,412.78\" I had to read it twice. I had never seen a dollar sign in front of that many number before. \"I thought they didn't keep gold there anymore, just nerve gas.\"\n         \"The gold is still there. How much can we sell before someone becomes suspicious?\" Charles put the bar down and slid a web pouch over it with shoulder straps like a small backpack.\n         \"None,\" I said and slipped the knife into his neck right at the base of his skull. Call me small minded, but you know \"a bird in the hand.\" All that gold in Fort Knox was just too much for me to wrap my head around. But I could handle a hundred and fifty-K easy, say seventy-five-K from the fence. I slipped the little pouch over my back and wiped the knife on his jacket. Then I made my way back to the little marker where we came in. His mistake had been in telling me the same gesture opened the door the other way. I worried for just a moment when I started waving my hands. \"What if it didn't work?\" So the icy wind at the top of the mound and the bright moon came as a real relief.\n         The gold was heavy on my back, and I was all the way to the car before I realized I had left the keys on Charles.\n         The highway patrol was just bound to come by then. After that it was just connect the dots back to prison. The rental car records pointed to Acres, and there was enough blood on the knife to match DNA from Acres comb in the motel. They never bothered trying to explain how Acres made it into the country without a ticket on a plane or a boat. But they speculated all through the trial about where the gold came from, offered me deals. The prosecution liked the idea that Acres was my smuggler's mule. I was a one man gold cartel in the news.\n         I'm just wondering what they'll think when they open that vault in Kentucky. And I still wonder why Charles picked me? Maybe he didn't know anybody else with \"connections.\" But mostly, I'm wondering what will happen when I try to make those gestures, that \"device\" right here in my cell? Acres said it was dangerous, but maybe I could find my way back to the mound or Easter Island even. I figure it can't be worse than the lethal injection that's waiting for me at dawn. I don't really believe I'll make it or I wouldn't say a thing. But if I do make it, it won't matter what I tell you, because there won't be a jail that can hold me. I'm leaving this just to tell \"whom it may concern\" to kiss my ever-lovin' ass. Wish me luck. I out of here.\n         \n         \n", "mode": "written", "name": "easy_money", "class": "fiction"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/fiction/hotel-california", "text": "\n\n\n>Hotel California\n\nFact: Sound is a vibration. Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no\nmedium. So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing. After the\nfirst whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder. Eyes bulging in\npanic, but no screams. Quiet and peaceful, right? Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter\nabout his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave. I\nswore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up\nfrom a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey. Metaphorically, of course.\n\nFact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself\ninto a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live. This is more than the person would have\nsans space suit. Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has\nfollowed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up;\nyes, studies have been done. So, twenty-four hours. Give or take.\n\nAbout the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating\nfelt like, that's when I heard a bell.\n\nMy first thought: I was going crazy. Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating\nnoises now?\n\nI heard it again. It was a fine bell, reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I'd\nseen in documentaries. And accompanying the bell, I saw a light.\n\nNow, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense. First, the whole in-a-vacuum\nwhy's-there-a-bell thing. Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable\nlight sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less\nbright.\n\nThese signals were the heralds of my saviors.\n\nThe first words they said to me meant nothing. I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was\ngoing to keep breathing. Next to those, nothing else mattered. The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and\nall thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like\nsex, only better. (I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.)\n\nWhen I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around. The ship, it was odd and\nold, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew\nstanding around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk. And me, I guess I was\none more piece in their puzzle. I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was\nfound.\n\nI was now one of them.\n\nThis story, it's our story. The survivors of the unfortunate accidents, the catastrophic malfunctions, the\nfateful crashes: this is us. Floating alone, each of us facing the silence of the vacuum, we were found.\n\nOnce found, we can never be lost.\n\nThis is our Hotel California.\n\nWe can never leave.\n\n\u201cSo, I'm on a ship now? You do this a lot?\u201d\n\nA woman, introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful, shrugged. \u201cNow and then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about my crewmates? Why didn't you save them?\u201d As much as Jesse had irritated me, I didn't like the\npicture my brain drew of him floating in his grave, body swollen and bloated. Who would tell his girl how he\nhad died?\n\n\u201cCouldn't,\u201d said the captain. Jefferson, he called himself, clean-shaven and smart, a picture of the perfect\nentrepreneur. An opportunist and a businessman, that was Jefferson. \u201cWe're selective about our passengers,\u201d he\ncontinued. \u201cYou fit the bill. They didn't.\u201d\n\nTiffany, she looked at the captain, grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder. She turned\nto me. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said, before I could say anything else, \u201clet's get you settled in.\u201d No time for\nquestions. No time for answers.\n\n The ship had all the usual accoutrements (artificial gravity, tastefully painted walls, sound dampeners to\nkeep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane, recycled air systems), and a few\nless-usual: lush carpeting, lighting that was decorative as well as functional, spacious corridors. The\noccasional painting hung on the wall (generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met,\nprimarily). Glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways; music; voices; the aroma of real food.\n\nThis was heaven. No seventy-two virgins, but it would do.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.\n\nTiffany looked back. \u201cTo your quarters. It's not far; you're not going to get blisters.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I meant, where's the ship going? What's our destination?\u201d\n\nTiffany, she stopped walking. She gave me a look, pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to\nshare the news. \u201cHoney,\u201d she said, \u201cYou're going to be delighted. Destination everywhere. Destination\nnowhere.\u201d\n\nThis was hell. I died in those last moments, suffocating on my own exhaled breath, and this, this was my\nreward.\n\nFact: The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit is three\nhundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per second.\n\nIt took me a couple days to realize I was, in fact, still alive. I mean, sure, I'd had my moment of elation\nwhen I had first realized I'd been rescued, but it didn't sink in. After watching my ship tear apart, after\nspending a good twenty-three hours floating in silence in the wreck, wondering whether I was currently facing\nstars belonging to the constellation Libra or the constellation Orion when those stars were viewed from Earth,\nwondering what it felt like to suffocate, and after the feeling that yes, I was in fact going to die alone in\nspace had sunk in, it took time for that feeling to dissipate.\n\nFact: I wasn't dead.\n\nAfter I realized this, I left my quarters. The lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official\nmeals were taking place, but I hadn't bothered to acknowledge the invitations. It hadn't seemed relevant,\nsomehow, given that I was still reeling over the explosion, the deaths of my crewmates, and the rescue. I've\nheard there are a number of stages of grief and shock; I guess I was working my way through them. Food was\ndelivered to my quarters. Initially, I couldn't figure out why\u2014I hadn't requested any be sent. Then I realized,\nsomeone must have noticed I hadn't left, and was nice enough to send food my way. The accompanying bottle of\nwine was a nice touch. I must have consumed it, too, because later on, the plates and the bottle were both\nempty. I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed, staring up at the little etched swirls in the\nceiling, or slumped in the old-fashioned armchair, staring out the windows at the stars. I did a lot of staring\nand not moving.\n\nMan, was it good to be done with that stage. \n\nIt was time to find out what hell looked like.\n\nFact: Hell is other people. Sure, the ship was spacious. We didn't pick up many passengers\u2014just the select,\nspecial few, scattered here and there between the stars. But we were all on this ship, and we were on it\ntogether.\n\nCliques form in any decent-sized group of people. Me, I was singled out by Sarah, an unassuming\nforty-something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the\nother. She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro\ncream dip onto a plate. The plate, by the way, was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish,\npaprika-dusted deviled eggs, toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese, and balls of\nmeat smothered in a tomato-based sauce. Luxurious, even compared to the fare one would find in the high-class\nspace stations and pleasure cruisers. Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship, it\nwas mouthwateringly, lip-smackingly gorgeous. I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days\nhad been similarly amazing. I decided it couldn't have been.\n\n\u201cLiking the taste of the sweet life, eh? I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis\u2014you must be the new pickup.\u201d She\nlooked me over approvingly. \u201cCome on, let's get you a glass of champagne.\u201d I looked longingly at the slices of\ncheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar, but didn't protest.\n\nThe bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot. It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a\nnod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her. I marveled at the robot's\nsmoothness and coordination. Clearly, it was a high-end model. Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and\npulled me away from the bar for more introductions, with Alexis trailing after us.\n\nI spent the evening listening, mostly. Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food\nprovided. No one minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter.\nRay, a plump man who was grey where he wasn't bald. Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze.\nHe made me a little uncomfortable. Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached\nnearly to her waist. I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the\ncrowd again later. Most of their chatter was meaningless to me\u2014stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so\nhad been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted\nthis delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat\npastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact.\n\nAfter the first half-hour, I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight. I\nwasn't learning anything useful. I could have started asking questions, but I wanted to get my bearings first.\nTonight was for observation. I didn't bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more\ninteresting people, though. They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less\napt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared. I wondered at the ship instead. All the fine\nfood and the ornamental lighting, it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain. If the barkeep was any\nindication, I suspected similarly high-class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship. How they were all\npowered was a mystery\u2014as good as the technology got, a quality robot like that was still an energy sink. It was\nthe brain, mostly; the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it\ndid ate up a lot of resources.\n\nSarah's crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled, all seemingly pleased to have\na new set of ears to talk at. I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised\nto find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film\u2014done in the style of old flatscreen\nmovies\u2014that I had seen during off-time at Geminia Station.\n\nBy the end of the evening, when I finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room, a satisfying\nhaze had settled on my mind. It was nice, I decided. This ship. This life. The nagging questions about where\nthe ship had come from and what its purpose in rescuing me was still nagged, but somehow, seemed less urgent.\nDid it truly matter what the ship's origin was and why Jefferson had saved me, if now, I was content?\n\nFact: It's easy to fall into patterns. I would wake late, checking the clock on my room's lightscreen to\nmake sure I hadn't slept through brunch. I would join the rest of the ship for meals, and I would take my turn\nin the weight room. I would watch old films on the entertainment screens, taking mental notes for later\ndinnertime discussions. I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks. I would attend afternoon dance\nclasses, so that when the evening dances came around (modeled after the historical social gatherings of several\nhundred years prior), I would be less of an embarrassment to myself.\n\nI did not ask questions. I told myself I should. I told myself that tonight, the observation period would\nend and I'd start puzzling out the ship's mystery. But I fell under the ship's sway. Bereft of my previous\nfamiliar life, I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng, and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and\nthen (he was mostly her favorite dancing partner; she confided to us one night that his conversational skills\nleft something to be desired). I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth\u2014this was my long-awaited vacation,\nmy clean break and my temporary retreat; I'd try contacting those friends tomorrow. I continued to care little\nfor shipwide gossip, but our discussions of films and flicks, old and new, brought out my artistic,\nstory-loving, argumentative side, a side of me I'd tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an\nengineer. It was a good life, if surreal. But I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.\n\nFact: Some places are timeless. Days passed, weeks passed, but I couldn't tell if it had been months or\nyears since I was rescued. All there was, all I remembered, was a blur. Gathering for drinks in the parlors,\nplaying dress up with all the fine clothes I found in the closets (some of it modern, some of it period dress\nfor special themed events), idling in the lounges. Now and then, a new face mingled in the crowd. Other faces\nwashed out, fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the\nengines.\n\nOne of these evenings, we were gathered in the South Ballroom for post-dinner drinks, lounging on couches\nand watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor. (The 'South' was in the title to\nsuggest that there were more ballrooms. There weren't.) Sarah's circle had picked up another newcomer,\nAdrienne, a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on\nEarth, let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her. Maybe it was her curiosity, asking a\nquestion I should have asked long before, that turned the conversation serious; maybe there was just something\nspecial about that evening. Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life, hitting some threshold or some\nbreaking point. Regardless, when Adrienne asked what the ship's purpose was, we all gave it a measure of\nthought. We dredged up half-fledged theories and inchoate explanations, tossing these out the same way we\npitched ideas about the art films.\n\n\u201cI believe we'll see the end of the universe,\u201d said Tiffany. Captain's cohort, she had a glass of\norange-brown liquid in one hand; it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor. She swirled it\nspeculatively. I watched Adrienne. She tilted her head, listening, not speaking.\n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Zheng, sitting in the chair to her left. \u201cWe can't live that long.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the universe will end sooner than you think,\u201d said Jefferson. Yeah, the captain was there, with the\nrest of us. He didn't drink, but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques.\n\n\u201cMaybe we'll travel at the speed of light and we won't age,\u201d said Sarah, setting her wine glass on the\nlittle round end table by her couch. \u201cMaybe we're already traveling at the speed of light.\u201d \n\nTiffany, she nodded eagerly. \u201cRelatively says it all.\u201d\n\nZheng scoffed. \u201cAlso impossible. Even if we were traveling at ninety-nine percent of the speed\nof light\u2014that's assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible, because it isn't\u2014we'd\nstill age. We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d said Sarah. \u201cAging is relative, anyway. Besides, I wouldn't mind being around forever. Give our\nancestors purpose. Keep their dreams alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew hypothesis,\u201d suggested Kishori, slipping into the conversation. \u201cNo one's immortal. In fact, the\nopposite: We're all going to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cBleak,\u201d commented Zheng. \u201cBut I like it.\u201d He grinned at Sarah, who frowned. Ray took a drink from his glass\nof ice water, and shook his head.\n\n\u201cWe're all going to die, so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have?\u201d Kishori gestured to the\nbar, the carpets, the paintings. \u201cAll the luxuries money can buy.\u201d\n\nTiffany took a drink, thinking. \u201cAll the luxuries money can buy,\u201d she echoed.\n\nZheng looked skeptical. \u201cPaid for how?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmuggling,\u201d responded Kishori. Matter-of-fact. Jefferson snorted, amused. \u201cThink about it,\u201d Kishori\ncontinued, \u201cwhere else would we get the money to buy all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cRenegade smugglers. So what's our cargo, eh, captain?\u201d Zheng joked, leaning back in his chair with his\nglass of wine.\n\nJefferson shook his head and stood up. \u201cI'll leave you to your speculation,\u201d he said. A chorus of good\nnights followed him out the door.\n\nAfter the captain left, Zheng leaned in. He set his glass down on an end table, steepled his fingers\ntogether. \u201cWe're revolting,\u201d he told us. \u201cAnd I don't mean that you disgust me. No, we're the start of a\nrebellion. Did you hear what the captain said earlier? He means, we're going to change the future. The universe\nas we know it won't be the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's dumb,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cWouldn't we know it if we were part of a rebellion?\n\nZheng shook his head. \u201cThe captain selected us for a reason. He has inside intelligence\u2014how else would he\nknow where to find us? He knows about us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's still dumb,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cInside intelligence? Don't you remember, there's not exactly one big\ngalactic government from which to steal information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still like my idea,\u201d said Tiffany.\n\nMe, I followed Adrienne's example and didn't speak up (fabricating excuses to myself to stay safely in\ngather-info observation mode), though I thought Zheng had a point. Jefferson didn't share how he found people.\nHe didn't share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were, or why he saved some people but not others. But then\nagain, no one asked. I guess we all figured, he knew what he was doing. He had been at this savior business\nlonger than any of us. I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that.\n\n\u201cWe're going to mean something,\u201d Zheng was saying. \u201cWhat we do, rebelling against the oppression of the many\ngovernments that oppose us, we're going to leave a legacy.\u201d He sounded certain. Enthusiastic, even.\n\nRay, he shook his head, and broke the quiet he'd held most of the evening. \u201cYou've got it all wrong.\u201d He\nlooked from Sarah, to Adrienne, to Zheng, to Kishori and Tiffany, to me. \u201cObviously, we can't last longer than\nthe rest of the universe. We aren't giving anyone purpose. We're not even going to leave a legacy. All we're\ndoing is existing. All we're doing is eating and drinking and shitting, breathing and fucking and nothing\nimportant, ever. We aren't special.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, bleak,\u201d commented Zheng. Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet. She leaned forward, setting her\nelbows on the foot stool in front of her.\n\n\u201cYou never know when it will end,\u201d Ray continued, not addressing any one of us in particular. \u201cYou can't\nhold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget. How long until the memories slip away? How long\nuntil all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you\nhold with the other shells who used to be people? When your life, the reason you lived, the people and faces\nand places, the emotions you felt, who and what you loved, when all that is gone, faded, what will you have\nleft?\u201d\n\nI wondered how long Ray had been on this ship. I wondered why, if he had such an unpropitious outlook, he\nhadn't tried to change his situation. I wanted to ask, but he was still talking, and I was too self-conscious\nto interrupt.\n\n\u201cYou can try to hold on,\u201d said Ray. \u201cYou can try and try and try. Repeat stories to yourself in the\nartificial night, sketch faces in your mind. You can make their names your mantra. But words, if you repeat\nthem enough times, lose their meaning. Emily emily em-ill-ee em-i-lee eh-mill-ee eh-mih-lee. My wife's name,\nonce. Repeat it enough times, it's just a sound. No longer grounded.\u201d\n\nRay, he said, \u201cIf we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't\nmean a thing to us. We won't care that we're last and we won't care that there are no more stars. We aren't\nangels. We're just dumb and lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cPure dumb luck,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cStruck a nerve, huh?\u201d said Zheng. \n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Ray. \n\n\u201cHow long ago was that?\u201d asked Adrienne. \u201cLeaving your wife, I mean. Traveling on this ship.\u201d\n\nRay, he looked down at his hands, folded together in his lap, fingers interlaced. \u201cI don't know,\u201d he said.\nWe were all quiet for a moment. Ray shrugged, then got up and left. We let him go. Silent. Self-conscious. More\nexcuses were made, and after a few moments, only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom. She looked\nacross the circle of couches at me.\n\n\u201cWhat's your theory?\u201d she asked me.\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that long,\u201d I said. \u201cA couple weeks, I guess. Maybe a month or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don't you know for sure?\u201d she asked.\n\nI shrugged. I hadn't been counting days.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do before this? How were you found?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was an engineer.\u201d I explained how my ship had malfunctioned, no warning at all. The explosions, the\nimpossible rescue. \u201cI don't know how Jefferson knew to find me there.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cThe ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too. Some vital part broke, and... well,\nboom. It was all so fast.\u201d She took a sip of her drink, plain water because, she had explained\nearlier, she had never liked the taste of alcohol, then fixed her gaze on me. \u201cI'm going to figure it out,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cHow and why this ship exists. I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.\u201d\n\nI paced my room that night, unable to sleep. The more I thought about it, the less sense the ship made.\nWorse, Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question. I had spent weeks asking nothing, contentedly\ngetting nowhere.\n\nFact: Adrienne intimidated me.\n\nFact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.\n\nI resolved to break the pattern.\n\nAnother evening, another chandeliered room, another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d'oevres.\nAnother circle of chairs and couches, another uncomfortable question.\n\n\u201cHas anyone ever left?\u201d Adrienne looked at each of us in turn.\n\nRay exchanged a glance with Zheng.\n\nSarah frowned. \u201cNow that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days. I assumed he was indisposed.\u201d\nKishori nodded in agreement.\n\nI looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ray said, slowly, \u201cPeople do leave. The approximate number of people at any given event\nis always the same. But we see new faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're sure it's not just some people being indisposed ? \u201d asked Adrienne, using Sarah's\nphrasing.\t\n\nZheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table. \u201cKeep\nadding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall. A couple people staying in their rooms, even if\nyou switch out the people, won't make a difference.\u201d He dropped the pecans back into the dish, one by one.\n\n\u201cSo where do they go?\u201d Adrienne focused on Zheng. \n\nI cut in. \u201cMaybe a better question is, does anyone ever come back?\u201d\n\nRay and Zheng exchanged another glance. Kishori chewed her lip. Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink.\nAfter a moment, Ray said, \u201cI don't think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there patterns?\u201d Adrienne asked. \u201cWho leaves?\u201d\n\nAgain, there was an uncomfortable moment of silence. I hazarded a guess. \u201cYou don't notice, do you.\u201d\n\nSarah looked indignant. \u201cOf course we notice. But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't\nreally matter, does it.\u201d I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left, and failing.\nNo one contradicted her. No one offered a different answer.\n\nI looked at Adrienne. Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted. The scales had\ntipped. Even when the conversation returned to lighter tones, as it soon did, I dwelt on Adrienne's questions.\nFrom the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d\n\nThe question, previously posed to me, was presented to the rest of our group (excluding Ray; Adrienne had\nbeen tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill, recalling the last time the subject was\nbroached).\n\nSarah, she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass. \u201cA long time. Got to be months\nand months, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were here before I was,\u201d said Kishori, \u201cand so was Tiffany.\u201d\n\nI looked at Zheng; he shrugged. \u201cTime passes in a weird way here. I kept track for a while\u2014thirty-eight\ndays\u2014but after that... I guess I didn't see the point.\u201d\n\nFact: Some places are timeless.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Adrienne.\n\n\u201cDays don't matter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eleventh of a month or the seventeenth, whether it's Wednesday or Sunday,\nsummer back on Earth or winter, it doesn't affect us here.\u201d\n\nTiffany nodded, but Kishori spoke before the other woman could. \u201cWhy are you so interested?\u201d she asked\nAdrienne.\n\nAdrienne met her gaze. \u201cI don't want to be here forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we're not here forever,\u201d objected Sarah. \u201cRemember? Alexis left.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisappeared,\u201d I corrected her. \u201cWe don't know how or why he left. Or where he went.\u201d\n\nZheng looked thoughtful. He picked up his glass, swirled the liquid around, took a sip, then set the glass\nback down. He glanced around at the rest of us. \u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d he asked. \u201cCould you live anywhere else\nnow?\u201d\n\nI spoke up. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI wouldn't miss this, much.\u201d No one else said anything. I watched Adrienne's\neyes move from one face to the next.\n\nZheng, he addressed me again, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense, steady gaze. \u201cYou\nthink that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut is it true? Would you be happy back in a normal life, working and living and crying\nin the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days?\u201d\n\nI didn't answer.\n\nFact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.\n\nFact: I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.\n\nMy quarters felt stifling. Asphyxiating my mind. I sat sideways in the armchair, feet dangling over one arm,\nneck resting against the other, absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I\nruminated on the situation. The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful. I inspected the arrays of\nentertainment options\u2014abstract, old-style flatscreens, engrossing VR flicks and action games, a selection of\nquondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity. There was a schedule\nadvertising upcoming on-ship events, such as dance classes, craft sessions, and discussion groups, and a list\nof dinner invitations for me to respond to. A menu of display options, allowing me to customize all the\nlightscreen's superficial characteristics. A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the\nship. That was all.\n\nA methodical search of my two adjoining rooms, the ample closet space, and the attached bathroom facility\nhad similarly provided no fodder. Furniture (dark wood, expensive, polished, no secret compartments), clothes,\nleftover tray of half-consumed food from the previous day's lunch, toiletries (complete with miniature bottles\nof sweet-smelling apricot honey lotion), lightscreen, me.\n\nI was discouraged and frustrated. I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ship's mystery just\nas much as she did. I wanted to find something, anything, that would prove all this was normal and sane. I\ndidn't want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences.\t\n\nI wanted my contentment back.\n\nI cornered Adrienne at dinner that night. In one hand I balanced my plate of star-shaped crackers, globs of\nelegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale\ngreen plant, and an array of other delectable, bite-sized items. My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a\nsmall table against a wall. She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d I said, after we sat, \u201cwhat you have found.\u201d It wasn't a question.\n\nShe gave me a grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me. \u201cNot if you're\ngoing to be rude about it.\u201d\n\nI sighed. \u201cSorry.\u201d I wasn't, not really, but I'd lie to get the conversation going. \u201cI want to know.\u201d I\nexplained, in two brief sentences, my earlier impasse.\n\n\u201cI don't know much,\u201d she said, still annoyed but at least cooperative. She reviewed the information gleaned\nfrom our previous dinner conversations, adding, \u201cI heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to\nthe Pyrope Parlor. I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple\npeople, and they must not have known I was there. He said something about a wreck going well. And listen, when\nthey came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.\u201d\n\nThe next time the captain stopped by our group, Tiffany tagging along (pretending that she, too, was a\nsocial butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone), we were ready.\n\n\u201cIs there a doctor on board?\u201d asked Adrienne. \u201cI've been having headaches.\u201d It was a lie, but we needed\ninformation.\n\nJefferson nodded. \u201cDown past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left. All hours.\u201d A robot, then. Medical\nAI were even more expensive than the barkeep. I wondered how many people it treated. Had anyone on the ship\never fallen seriously ill?\n\n\u201cDoes he age?\u201d asked Adrienne.\n\n\u201cThe captain?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI never thought about it.\u201d\n\nAdrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face. \u201cThat doesn't answer my question,\u201d she said.\n\nAdrienne only picked at her food. \n\n\u201cNot hungry?\u201d asked Kishori sympathetically.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Adrienne.\n\n\u201cAt least have a drink,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cI find it takes the edge off.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn't drink, remember?\u201d said Kishori.\n\n\u201cMaybe that's the problem,\u201d said Sarah.\n\n\u201cOne hundred and forty-seven is a magic number,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cYou ever heard of Dunbar? Well, we've got the\nperfect-size group right here.\u201d Just enough for us all to recognize each other. Just enough for us all to be\nable to barely avoid killing each other.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn't anyone mutiny?\u201d Adrienne asked. \u201cIf you dislike this place so much, why don't you do something\nabout it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can't,\u201d said Ray. \u201cWhat would we do?\u201d\n\nAdrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust. \u201cYou could force the captain to set down somewhere. Let\nus off the ship. If he refuses, threaten him. If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there\nsomeone who can drive a ship?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's murder,\u201d objected Sarah.\n\n\u201cThat's survival, \u201d Adrienne corrected her. \u201cDo you want to be stuck here for the rest of your\nlife?\u201d\n\nSarah didn't reply.\n\nI shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge, looking out the windows at the stars.\nTimes like that, running on less sleep than I should, alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire\nfor the night, I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it. The stillness of\nthe room contributed, as did the view. Black and more black, speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to\nbreak the emptiness, if only for a brief time. All of it was temporary, save for the black. That was tonight's\nmelodramatic theme: the ephemeral nature of life. Everything temporary. Everything to fade away, lost as dust\nand scattered atoms between the stars, and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born.\n\nThinking about that, I wondered if Sarah's theory was right after all. Some things in this world, we have to\nmake them permanent ourselves. And Jefferson, he had done that. He had made us a constant. He made this\nship\u2014this life\u2014a constant. The one thing that was known. The one thing that wouldn't change.\n\nMaybe everything we did, all the stories we told, maybe it was all lies. Maybe we'd never know each other,\nnot truly, because we all hid behind the stories, creating the realities we wanted to see. But ultimately, this\nship, its purpose, our purpose\u2014did it matter? We each had our own theory. Maybe that was enough. And all of us,\nwe were permanent characters in each others' stories. Maybe that made us more real. Maybe it made us feel less\nalone.\n\n\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d\n\nI turned to see Adrienne in the doorway. She smiled, then crossed the room to join me by the window, not\nwaiting for an answer. \n\n\u201cSome nights,\u201d I said, \u201cI can't see the meaning in any of it. All these things I do, they're just to pass\nthe time until I die.\u201d\n\nAdrienne looked at me, then back out through the window. \u201cYou don't see a meaning because there is no\nmeaning,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter all of it, as much as we feared being alone, we feared being vulnerable even more. Our instinct was to\nhide.\n\n\u201cLook what I found,\u201d Adrienne said. In her hands was a bottle.\n\nAnd what happens to Adrienne?\n\nI couldn't find her.\n\nJefferson was in the Captain's Lounge, \n\nFact: Sound is a vibration. The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees\nFahrenheit is three hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per\nsecond.\n\n\u201cUp his dosage,\u201d I heard the captain say. \u201cI've got a replacement lined up.\u201d\n\nI ran.\n\nI didn't want to forget.\n\nI didn't want to be harvested.\n\nThe last thing I remember, I was tearing down the corridors. Life boats, I thought. Every ship had life\nboats. In case of emergency, break glass. I'd find one. I'd put on a space suit, I'd get out of this ship, I'd\nfind civilization again. A planet. A space station. Some other ship. Any place but this place.\n\nFailing all else, I'd suffocate. Alone.\n\nRay, he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls, finding no glass to break. \u201cRelax,\u201d he told me,\nsliding a needle into my arm. \u201cIt'll pass,\u201d he told me. He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing.\n\nIt passed.\n\nThis is my Hotel California.\n\nI can never leave.\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "hotel-california", "class": "fiction"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/fiction/lw1", "text": "Tara stood stock-still, waiting for the first tiny gleam from the scout craft to\nappear in the darkness of the wormhole. The gentle constant breeze of recycled\nair from the vent above blew an annoying hair against her nose, but she ignored\nit.\n\nA gasp from the psychic broke her silent vigil, and she turned.\n\n\"Results, Harmon?\" she suppressed the surge of annoyance that ran through her as\nshe contemplated the psi's gift of getting all the hot news first.\n\nHarmon's face slowly animated - joy sweeping in to replace stern concentration.\n\"Tarrin says the planet's a freaking gemstone! Thriving with life, large and\nsmall forms, no buildings of any kind, hydrocarbons, metals, and a stable\natmosphere. He's not even bringing them back through for a face to face\nbriefing. He says we should come through now, immediately, before the probe is\nreported late.\"\n\n\"Harmon, tell that good for nothing son of a beta to get his hindquarters\nthrough the gate and back here NOW, or I'll open fire on him when we come back\nthrough.\" Tara fumed. Of all the impertinence! Tarrin, no doubt with orders from\nMason, was questioning her command decisions. That's what I get for not using\nmercenaries.\n\nShe returned to her watch, regarding her own reflection in the long window.\nMahogany-black curly hair, cut short in the typical military style framed a\ncareworn, dark-skinned face. It was not an attractive face right now; her ebony\neyes shadowed by hours on the watch, full lips pursed with frustration. She had\nthe look of every leader she had ever known. At six foot two, she stood a full\nhead taller than even her Arrallin first officer. Her glowering expression\ncompleted the imposing effect. She picked imaginary flecks off her stark gray\njumpsuit, and snorted. You look like hell, Tar. Don't blow this. Don't let\nfatigue get to you.\n\nShe used the discretion of the mirrored window to secretively survey her crew.\nHarmon was an excellent addition to the bridge team, but was she open minded\nenough to defy United Earth Command and sever all ties from Earth? She watched\nthe psi bob her head, unaware of the rest of the bridge, shaking blonde curls as\nshe chattered away with the approaching psi relay on Mason's ship. She seemed so\ndepthless - self conscious and shallow on the outside, but having that\nincredible gift. There had to be more to her.\n\nWell, if she didn't pan out, she'd be terminated. Any crew member that would\njeopardize the project was meat. It would be a shame to lose that talent,\nthough.\n\nRakal, her first officer, was staring pensively at his panel. He was what this\nwas all about. She watched his graceful fingers ending in thick black claws tap\nout calculations on the panel. His pointed ears swiveled back and forth,\ncatching every sound from the bridge, while his long tail swished to the rhythm\nof his thoughts. Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was\nno common 'beta furry'. His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped\nwith jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed\nand thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat. His eyes had\nbeen treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden\nyellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin, and leader of his hive.\nRight now, he looked like an overgrown wolf who'd learned touch-typing.\n\nThe scout ship re-emerged from the hole - a brilliant speck emerging from a\nsphere of velvety blackness. It's hail crackled across the comm, and Tara spun\nto retake her seat at the helm. \"Launch the second probe. Won't Central be\ncrushed to learn that another gateway has yielded little more than a class F\nplanet and a white dwarf system. Level 1 and 2 staffers should prepare to be\nbriefed and move out. This sounds like it's the one.\" The distinctive whuffle of\npleasure rippled through the betas on the bridge, and Rakal let loose a small\ngrowl, as if to caution his charges against false hope. They'd scouted\ntwenty-seven gates so far, and none had turned up anything worth the\nInsurrection's time. Tara would not let giddy hopes drag them onto a rock that\nwould spell the end for the project, and the Arrallin species.\n", "mode": "written", "name": "lw1", "class": "fiction"}

It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the \"second sight\", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times. When I asked her if she'd ever seen them \u2013 before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean \u2013 she would always look sad and tell me, \"No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us. But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly.\" As I got older, I shook the tales off with a nod and a \"Yes, Nana.\"\n            I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything. My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school. Sometimes we'd get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges, and we'd rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up. Boston is a strange place at night. You wouldn't believe half of the shit I've seen, even when I was straight.\n            It was a Friday night. Rachel and I went out to dinner, and when we finished, she saw that there was a message on her cell phone. She checked it there in the restaurant. Her head tilted into the phone as she listened, her pleather purse on her lap, shining jet against the worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance T-shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s from Mitch,\u201d she said, folding up the phone. \u201cHe says we should meet him tonight, there\u2019s a good one going on in that church that closed down last month.\u201d\n            \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 it was going to be just us tonight. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m up for a night out.\u201d I was feeling calm and private that night. It seemed like tonight\u2019s darkness was small and personal, cupped hands offering a place for two, not the burning, open darkness of a rave.\n            \u201cBaby, let\u2019s go. It\u2019s been over a week, and I want to dance. Let\u2019s go together, you know you\u2019ll have fun once you get into it.\u201d She bit the inside of her bottom lip, looking at me like I was breaking her poor, sweet heart. I\u2019m a sucker for that, and she knows it.\n            \u201cOkay, Rachel. Let\u2019s go, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d\n            She grinned and gave me a kiss across the table, her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing, not just pressing your face into someone else\u2019s. \n            \u201cLet\u2019s not get fucked up tonight, though, okay, Rache? We don\u2019t \u2013 \u201d\n            \u201cSure, babe. Come on, I don\u2019t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself. Let\u2019s not waste any more time.\u201d She stood up and I followed her out to the street. It was dark enough that I could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light. Without hearing the car horns, I could almost taste the air of late March through the street fumes. If it was March, that meant that we\u2019d been together almost a year and a half. It was last February, after the winter break, that we moved in together. Now spring was back, under the concrete, and I could smell it even here.\n            \u201cIsn\u2019t it an amazing night, Rache? Even the city feels alive when spring comes.\u201d\n            \u201cTaxi!\u201d She waved down a car and pulled me in. In a few minutes, we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church. After she paid the driver, she grabbed my arm, laughing, and we ran down the street. I heard the pulse already. We slammed against the doorway and I was laughing too, the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest, Rachel in my arms because she\u2019d used me to soften her landing. We kissed and slipped inside.\n            The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ\u2019s toolkit and his beer. Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they\u2019d taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ\u2019s moving sermon.\n            Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling\u2019s blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air.\n            I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. \n            When she hadn\u2019t come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn\u2019t see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn\u2019t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn\u2019t move, just stared and held his drink. \n            The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm. I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong.\n            Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn\u2019t come home. I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she\u2019d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck. A couple of them remembered seeing her leave, but none of them had seen the thin man with her. I didn\u2019t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light.\n            I caught a taxi back to the church. It was still a mess, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared. I walked across what had been the dance floor. The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights. I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up \u2013 which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never.\n            Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police. \u201cI need to file a missing persons report. \u2026Rachel Frieze. Last night, walking on West 2nd street around \u2013 maybe eleven or twelve o\u2019clock. What? \u2026But, sir, this is an unusual situation. She didn\u2019t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her. \u2026Sir, if she\u2019s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time. My girlfriend has disappeared, I don\u2019t even know where to start looking, and I need help! \u2026Yes, sir. I understand.\u201d The police wouldn\u2019t file a report for someone who\u2019d been missing overnight. I closed the phone. \n            Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise. A cold front must have hit while I was inside. Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn\u2019t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran. I pulled my T-shirt\u2019s sleeves down my arms as far as they\u2019d go, but I wasn\u2019t ready for cold. \n            Walking didn\u2019t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more. After I\u2019d walked about a block, a car rolled up behind me. It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry. This wasn\u2019t the best of neighborhoods. I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it. \n            I heard an automatic window roll down. \u201cHey,\u201d said a male voice, \u201cdo you need some help?\u201d\n            I turned around. The man looked over forty, and he was driving a car I\u2019d be afraid to drive on this street. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way to anywhere worth going,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you like some help?\u201d\n            \u201cAh, I think I\u2019m fine, thanks,\u201d I told him, and turned back to the sidewalk.\n            \u201cReally, I\u2019d like to help. Please, hop in. You don\u2019t look dressed for this weather.\u201d\n            I glanced back over my shoulder. \u201cNo thanks, sir! I\u2019m just fine. Really, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\n            \u201cNathan Spencer, I offer you help. I advise that you not refuse me a third time.\u201d\n            I stopped and looked back at him, surprised. He met my eyes coolly. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d\n            \u201cI know your family. Get in. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it\u2019s best to start now.\u201d\n            I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat. Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m in the car. Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now? In fact, why didn\u2019t you call me by name the first time? And how did you recognize me when \u2013 \u201d\n            \u201cThat\u2019s enough! I can only answer one question at a time. I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours. I am here now because you called for help, and no-one else would answer.\u201d He turned onto the next street and shifted up. \u201cI will help you find your Rachel. I have to warn you, though, you won\u2019t like what I have to tell you.\u201d\n            I shivered. Something in his tone couldn\u2019t be disbelieved. \u201cTell me anyway. If she\u2019s in trouble, I want to find her, wherever she is.\u201d\n            My driver took a deep breath. As he did, his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines, like wrinkles, running across the sides of his neck. \u201cNathan,\u201d he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation, \u201cRachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet. This person, like me, is not a member of traditional society. You see, Nathan, there is \u2026separate from your society \u2026oh, damn it. I\u2019ve never had to give this conversation before. Come on, I have something to show you.\u201d With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn\u2019t noticed before. We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn\u2019t tell whether they were abandoned. My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year. \n            In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets. Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog. I got a strange feeling that we weren\u2019t supposed to be driving here. \u201cHey,\u201d I said, \u201care you sure that we should be going this way? I mean \u2013 \u201d \n            \u201cJust ignore that,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou\u2019ll be used to the sensation in a moment.\u201d That just unnerved me more. As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced. I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings. Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes. \u201cOkay, this is the spot,\u201d said my driver, pulling over. He parked and got out. \n            \u201cIs it really safe to leave the car \u2026\u201d he was already walking toward the squat, brick-windowed building we were parked next to. Glancing back at that gleaming glare, I decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car. I hopped out, ran after him, and reached him just as he was knocking on the door. Someone opened it a crack, then ushered us in.\n            Inside, the building opened up. The ceiling was high and wooden, and I could see part of a DJ\u2019s booth down the hall. It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub. Then I looked down and saw what had let us in. \u201cNepthys, my man! What up?\u201d The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap. \u201cNice, my man,\u201d he said as they clasped hands. \u201cWho\u2019s the freak?\u201d\n            \u201cThis is someone from Ivan\u2019s family. Did I ever tell you about them?\u201d\n            \u201cYeah, one time, man, but you were pretty fucked up. What\u2019s your problem, kid?\u201d\n            The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach. His skin was brown and stretched, like some diseased sapling\u2019s bark. It pulled back around his fingertips, which bore things that might have been nails or claws. When he grinned, I saw that his teeth were sharp and small, like a hunting cat\u2019s. Under matted hair, his eyes had slit pupils.\n            Nepthys quickly answered for me. \u201cGirlfriend troubles. She came down here with someone after a party, and I don\u2019t think it was one of your average pixies.\u201d\n            \u201cBummer. So, what\u2019s the cat look like?\u201d\n            He turned to me. Nepthys nodded: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can trust him. That\u2019s why we came here.\u201d\n            It was easier to talk than to question. \u201cI \u2026I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel. He was standing right in front of some blue lights, so I couldn\u2019t see him very well, but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin. It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly. He was slim, almost drawn, but he had a kind of \u2026 luster to him, I guess. He wasn\u2019t a person you\u2019d describe with normal adjectives, you know?\u201d\n            They nodded. \u201cOh, totally,\u201d said the hunchback. \u201cI get that all the time around here.\u201d\n            \u201cHe was wearing a sort of jacket \u2026maybe blue velvet, I couldn\u2019t tell in the dark, but it had ruffles at the throat, things like that. He really stood out. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t understand why no-one else remembered him. He had some rings, too. I remember that he hardly ever moved, just stared at Rachel. Even when he talked, he hardly opened his mouth. I don\u2019t know how he could\u2019ve been heard over the music.\u201d\n            The two glanced at each other. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked the hunchback.\n            \u201cI\u2019ve looked into it a little, and I do think we might be dealing with one of them. Have you seen anyone like that in your club?\u201d\n            \u201cNot that I can remember, man. I can send you to a guy who knows all about them, though. If this cat\u2019s for real, I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know.\u201d\n            \u201cYou\u2019re a wonder, Dvorov. We should head straight over. It won\u2019t be long before nightfall.\u201d\n            \u201cOh yeah, man. Here, let me write down how to find him.\u201d The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail, then handed it to Nepthys. \u201cHere you go, man. Good luck!\u201d\n            \u201cThanks, Dvorov. I owe you one. Let\u2019s go.\u201d That last one was to me. I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left. He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor. \n            Back on the street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then. Still in my initial shock, I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn\u2019t registered when we parked. I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through \u2013 people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail. The yellow of this sky wasn\u2019t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness. I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light. A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle. Leaning from the rough-hewn window of one building on our right was something with long, green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill. Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed. I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards.\n            \u201cWe, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,\u201d said my driver. I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills. \u201cWe interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction. At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional.\n            \u201cThe only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours. Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world. Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won\u2019t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.\u201d\n            He took out the hunchback\u2019s directions and glanced at an alley behind us. \u201cOkay, Nathan. We should get started right away. There\u2019s no time to waste.\u201d \n            He saw that I wasn\u2019t moving. Setting an arm on my shoulder, he said, \u201cNathan, what you see here might be frightening, but those things you saw are people just like you. They\u2019ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms.\u201d\n            \u201cThanks. It\u2019s very reassuring that I\u2019ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity.\u201d\n            \u201cNathan, you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel. Well, she\u2019s here and she needs your help. Now, the more we can do before nightfall, the better.\u201d\n            \u201cBut why are you even helping me? Until thirty seconds ago, I didn\u2019t believe in magic or any of that kind of \u2026weirdness.\u201d \n            \u201cNathan, I told you: my family owes yours a debt. In this world, one\u2019s word is a promise. Now, can we get going?\u201d\n            I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye. \u201cOnly if you stop beginning every sentence with my name.\u201d\n            \u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n            As we headed down the sidewalk, I said, \u201cWhat is your name, anyway?\u201d\n            \u201cThat\u2019s a question you learn not to ask here. What you may call me is Nepthys.\u201d\n            Holding Dvorov\u2019s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway. I started wondering again how reliable my guide\u2019s credentials were. Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence.\n            \u201cJust at this corner,\u201d he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, \u201cwe\u2019re going to stop and turn three times widdersh \u2013 er, counterclockwise, then face east. East is that way.\u201d He pointed at the wall to our right. \u201cDon\u2019t let the sun fool you. Then I\u2019m going to shed a little blood, but don\u2019t worry, none of yours.\u201d I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner. \u201cOkay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left. Try to keep in time with me.\u201d We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys\u2019 hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust. The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back. When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner. Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d\n            We slipped through the door and came out, not inside the building, but on a busy street in a completely different part of town. The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I\u2019d picture a market in the Middle East. Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs. Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn\u2019t place. The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I\u2019d always given the caterpillar. Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated. Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose. \u201cWould the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?\u201d it asked. \u201cThere are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion. Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.\u201d\n            \u201cWe\u2019re not here to browse,\u201d Nepthys told him. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see a man about some garlic.\u201d\n            The thing frowned. \u201cWe have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart, gentle sir. If \u2013 \u201d\n            \u201cYou know what I mean. Please, if we could see him, we would be much obliged. I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.\u201d\n            It hissed thoughtfully. \u201cTrue, true. Step behind the cart and enter through the door there, using your left hand to open the door and your right \u2013 \u201d he looked at me \u201c \u2013 to close it.\u201d\n            \u201cThank you.\u201d Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart.\n            The latch opened under Nepthys\u2019 left hand with a clack! The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs. At the top was one door. We entered.\n            The room held a bed, a bookcase, and a desk with one chair. Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls. On the bed was a small, ratty man. I smelled matted hair and cedar chips. He opened one eye when we came in but did not move.\n            \u201cWe\u2019re here for information about a vampire,\u201d said Nepthys.\n            \u201cOh, shit!\u201d I said.\n            \u201cSorry, kid. \u2013Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual?\u201d\n            \u201cWait, Nepthys \u2013 you said nothing about vampires. Frankly, I don\u2019t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire. There\u2019s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are. Are \u2026look, are they as bad as people in my world think they are?\u201d\n            \u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re almost as rare here, and I\u2019ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire.\u201d\n            \u201cOnly unsuccessfully, right?\u201d\n            \u201cNo, those people don\u2019t usually leave stories.\u201d\n            \u201cOh, thanks, Nepthys, for your confidence-inspiring tales of experience. So they\u2019re probably worse than we think, okay, that\u2019s great. Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?\u201d\n            \u201cMy plan is that you shut up while we\u2019re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we\u2019re actually going up against. Okay? Don\u2019t forget, she\u2019s your girlfriend. Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman. I can hear your heartbeat from over here.\u201d\n            I shut up and tried to breathe. Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed, who had not moved. \u201cPlease, accept our apologies. As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to the young man. Now: may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire? It would be a great help to us.\u201d\n            The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden room\u2019s tight air. Finally, in a pinched rasp, he said, \u201cMy information is purely for the purposes of a collector. I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm.\u201d\n            \u201cSir, we simply want to discover whether this individual is, in fact, a vampire. If there is any boon that you would have us do in return, we would be glad to do it.\u201d\n            He continued to lie in place, still breathing heavily. I tried to keep myself calm. Then, with a sigh, he said, \u201cI have need of a certain stone that I once possessed. It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness. My problem is that it was not made in this realm, but by a human, and only a human may handle it. The herb vendor will tell you where you can find it. If you would fetch me this stone, I would tell you what I can.\u201d\n            \u201cOf course we will fetch you the stone,\u201d Nepthys assured him. \u201cYou have our thanks.\u201d\n            Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone. He told Nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street, and we set off.\n            When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant. Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys. Nepthys didn\u2019t need to warn me not to speak to them. He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d\u2019s light, and handcuffed. \n            Inside, the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions. Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive. A large woman, similarly decorated, quickly drifted up to us.\n            \u201cGood evening, gentlemen,\u201d she said. \u201cMay I invite you to have a cup of tea?\u201d\n            \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Nepthys, \u201cwe regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. Are you the proprietor of this shop?\u201d\n            \u201cYes,\u201d answered the woman. \u201cI am Madame Entera, at your service. How can I help you gentlemen?\u201d\n            \u201cWe are here to see about a certain stone.\u201d\n            She raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you? Well, we don\u2019t get many customers asking about that item. Please, walk this way.\u201d\n            She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen. The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome, with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd, floppy hats on the other. After this, we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside.\n            \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, ignoring Nepthys\u2019 warning look, \u201cbut may I ask what is kept in these rooms?\u201d\n            The woman laughed. \u201cWhy, the merchandise, of course,\u201d she said. \n            Nepthys leaned close to my ear. \u201cThis is a slave shop,\u201d he explained quietly.\n            The woman paused before another door, this one not barred but locked. As she brought out the key, she said, \u201cWe deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items. We\u2019ve had genies, indentured sorcerers, even golems and the occasional elf. This is one of the stranger items, though. It\u2019s been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it. If we only had a human on our staff, we could have done so ages ago and sold it off, but we have no such luck.\u201d She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room. \u201cHere it is,\u201d she said.\n            With a flourish, she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire, intricate patterns like a Czar\u2019s jewelry box crawling down the walls. In its center, under a spearing, white light, was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth, on which lay a gray, plum-sized rock.\n            \u201cA marvel, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cThat such a rock could hold so much magic \u2013 it\u2019s a wonder.\u201d\n            \u201cThat it is,\u201d Nepthys assured her. \u201cWhat would convince you to part with it?\u201d\n            She considered this, looking him over. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t give me the human, would you? No,\u201d she said, seeing his expression, \u201cthat would make the stone rather useless.\u201d Nevertheless, she gave me what I can only describe as an \u201cappraising glance\u201d. I have never felt so appraised in all my life. \u201cHe looks healthy,\u201d she said, \u201chow about a pint of his blood?\u201d\n            \u201cA pint? Madame, I have his health to consider.\u201d\n            \u201cHalf a pint, then \u2013 and his hair.\u201d\n            Nepthys turned to me. \u201cWell, kid, what do you think? Remember, this is your quest. I\u2019m not giving my blood.\u201d\n            \u201cAs if I wanted it,\u201d interrupted the woman. \n            \u201cI think it\u2019s a fair deal, considering the return,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut it\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n            I thought about it, then nodded.\n            \u201cMarvelous!\u201d cried the woman. \u201cOne half-pint of human blood, willingly given, and his fine head of hair for the stone.\u201d \n            She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping. There was a wooden chair, where she sat me down and asked me to wait. Soon, she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl, which she put on the table beside me. \u201cRoll up your sleeves,\u201d she told me. She opened the bowl and carefully, gingerly brought out a fat, dripping leech. It must have been larger than my finger. She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm. The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker-mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin. I thought that I could feel a slight itching.\n            \u201cThey take about a quarter-pint each,\u201d said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech. \u201cThey\u2019re quick, too. We\u2019ll be done with them before your hair is finished.\u201d Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber.\n            Half an hour later, I left the room pale and bald, running my fingers over my scalp. At least the barber hadn\u2019t nicked me. Madame Entera took me back up to the stone\u2019s room, where Nepthys was waiting by the door. \u201cBe careful you don\u2019t let him touch it until you\u2019re ready to use it,\u201d the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him. \u201cThank you for doing business at our house, and I hope to see you again!\u201d\n            I left not a little unnerved, and still woozy from the leeches. \u201cCome on,\u201d said Nepthys, \u201cyou could use a drink.\u201d\n            We hit a bar on the next street over. \u201cVodka, straight up,\u201d Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter, \u201cand a Bloody Mary for my friend. Make it extra bloody.\u201d When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary. \u201cThat should help,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could run on empty with a little of that stuff. It won\u2019t refill your blood supply, but while that\u2019s in your system, you won\u2019t even need blood.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cDrink up, kid.\u201d\n            I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery. Nepthys slapped me on the back. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cnow that we\u2019re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what\u2019s going on here? I mean, what is this place, really?\u201d\n            He thought about that. \u201cI think that our world is a reflection of yours, or yours is a more boring reflection of ours. This place is just a little of both. In America, things are still weird after the European conquest. The natives are still here, but so is everyone else. The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities. We aren\u2019t quite what you\u2019d expect from reading the Grimms.\u201d\n            \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n            \u201cOkay, take elves.\u201d He caught the bartender\u2019s eye for another shot. \u201cYou figure they\u2019re some Lincoln-green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory, right? Not in America. Here, they\u2019re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the \u2018gritty ambience\u2019 \u2013 you have them in your world, too, right? Except it\u2019s worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of society\u2019s lowest rungs. Some of them actually commit to this society, though. There\u2019s an amazing DJ who\u2019s an elf. He has a real ear for it. When they do decide to do something for real, they\u2019re always the best at it.\u201d He downed the second shot. \u201cI am glad to be out of the favor-trading scene for half a minute. It\u2019s exhausting to talk to those people. One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something. So what else do you want to know, Nathan?\u201d\n            \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026hey, what about the nature spirits, things like that? I mean, where do the dryads fit in a place like this?\u201d\n            \u201cIf the tree isn\u2019t around, the dryad isn\u2019t around. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n            That made me a little sad. They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school. \u201cWell, what about you? How did you get to America?\u201d\n            \u201cMy parents came over from Russia, just like your family. My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don\u2019t toss those around in this place. They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary. When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they\u2019d protected. I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river. Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it\u2019s better than waiting to get dammed.\u201d He took another shot of vodka.\n            \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be going light on the vodka? I mean, we might have a lot of work ahead of us.\u201d\n            \u201cAre you kidding? I can drink like a fish, kid. We should get going, though. Still woozy?\u201d I nodded. \u201cA little walking should get the stuff into your system. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n            As we left the bar, I asked to see the rock. \u201cWhy?\u201d Nepthys asked.\n            \u201cI\u2019m just curious. I want to see what a magic stone looks like. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be careful not to touch it.\u201d\n            He thought about it, then handed me the pouch. I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside. It looked like a normal river stone, a gray oval with a white stripe through it. As long as I looked at it, it didn\u2019t reveal any magic sparkle or glow. \n            Suddenly, what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me. I almost tripped over him, and the stone went flying out of the pouch. Nepthys tried to grab it, but, by reflex, I caught it first. \n            Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid. \u201cNathan,\u201d said Nepthys, \u201cI think that you just did something very stupid.\u201d\n            \u201cI agree,\u201d I told him. The stone was as warm as human flesh now, and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone\u2019s soft heat, I don\u2019t know. Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air. The air around me seemed to still sound, and light came in around the corners of my eyes. \u201cDo you know what this thing does?\u201d I shouted, hardly able to hear myself.\n            Nepthys was saying something that looked like, \u201cI have no idea!\u201d but I couldn\u2019t hear him. The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind. Then I opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street. There was no sign of the stone.\n            \u201cI think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,\u201d said Nepthys. The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone\u2019s glow, and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot. Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles, and soft, white leather boots held her feet.\n            When she didn\u2019t move, I knelt down and put a hand to her brow. As soon as I touched her, her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist. I couldn\u2019t move.\n            \u201cName me,\u201d she said.\n            I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation, but Nepthys stopped me. \u201cDon\u2019t name her \u2018What did you say?\u2019, okay? The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she\u2019ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back.\u201d\n            I was at a loss. I\u2019d never named anyone before. I thought back to one time when I\u2019d been thinking about raising a family and remembered that I\u2019d always liked the name \u2013 \n            \u201cAmy.\u201d\n            Nepthys looked at me incredulously. \u201cYou awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone, having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer, and you name her \u2018Amy\u2019?\u201d Amy smiled at me and let go of my arm, but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss.\n            I stood up and Amy stood with me. \u201cSo \u2026back to our garlicky friend?\u201d\n            \u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Nepthys, \u201cand you\u2019d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won\u2019t care we woke her up.\u201d\n            We walked back to the herb stand. The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand\u2019s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs.\n            When Nepthys opened the little man\u2019s door, he rolled over and grinned to see us, but when Amy walked in, he blanched. \u201cWhat!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou idiots! You woke it up? Get out of my sight this instant!\u201d\n            \u201cBut \u2026but sir,\u201d I said, \u201care you sure she\u2019s no help to you?\u201d\n            \u201cNot if you named it already, you ninny, and I\u2019m sure that you have! Fools! Get out of my sight now \u2013 unless you know how to put it back? \u2026I thought as much. Now leave, before I call the rats on you.\u201d\n            We left. Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck. \u201cYou idiot,\u201d he hissed, \u201cdo you know how much you\u2019ve set us back? I should say, set yourself back, since it\u2019s your girlfriend we\u2019re looking for.\u201d I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts. \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky that Dvorov isn\u2019t my only contact. Come on, we\u2019re heading out.\u201d He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs. Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark. \u201cNight comes quickly here,\u201d said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me. \u201cDidn\u2019t I warn you?\u201d\n            \u201cOkay,\u201d he said as we hit the street, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see another friend of mine. First, though, we are getting you a hat. You look ridiculous with a shaved head.\u201d At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston. It was a black baseball cap that read \u201cDead Can Dance\u201d in gold across the front. Amy liked it, I think. She still hadn\u2019t spoken since I named her, so I wasn\u2019t sure.\n            He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal. The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door. He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth. I only say \u201che\u201d because he didn\u2019t have a hint of femininity. His eyes were white. From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure\u2019s \u201cA Forest\u201d.\n            \u201cI\u2019m here to see Isis. Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.\u201d\n            The man closed his eyes. A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in. Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up, taking Amy\u2019s small hand so that she wouldn\u2019t lag behind. I shivered as I walked past the pale man\u2019s blank eyes, wondering what they were staring at. Amy gave my hand a squeeze.\n            Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade, a vaulted, ribbed intestine of a hallway, whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic. I thought that I saw one rib shift in its setting, like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall, but when I turned, it was still.\n            Then there was a door, which opened as we approached. Inside, the space opened into a wide, square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size. In the center was a dais covered with white furs and a young woman, surrounded by more pale men. These were incontestably male.\n            \u201cNepthys!\u201d said the woman, slithering up across the furs to sit up. As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like a red silk kimono, she was naked \u2013 naked and stunning. I had an urge to cover Amy\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve seen you. Please, come and sit beside me, and introduce your friends.\u201d\n            \u201cThis man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,\u201d said Nepthys, ushering us toward the woman in silk. \u201cThe girl is \u2026surprising,\u201d he concluded.\n            \u201cAnd I am Isis,\u201d said the woman, offering her hand to me. I took it and, dropping to one knee, gave her fingers a small kiss. It seemed appropriate. \u201cIt is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,\u201d I said.\n            She laughed, liquid, alluring, alarming. \u201cOh, precious! He has lovely manners, Nepthys, despite his poor taste in hats. You may leave out the \u2018Lady,\u2019 boy. I don\u2019t wish to be reminded of how old I actually am.\u201d A wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes. \u201cNow, how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge? I hope I can start by offering some wine.\u201d\n            Nepthys poured out wine for three of us. \u201cMay I have a little more of what you gave me before, Nepthys?\u201d I asked. \u201cI still feel a little woozy.\u201d He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me. The wine\u2019s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar, but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth.\n            Isis\u2019 nostrils twitched slightly. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost blood, boy? This story might be interesting. Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved?\u201d\n            \u201cIt was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,\u201d explained Nepthys. \n            \u201cI have a feeling that she was worth the trade,\u201d I added. Amy, still holding my hand, smiled.\n            \u201cShe may be at that,\u201d said Isis, gazing at her. \u201cThat sweet, small nose, and her soft lips \u2013 she\u2019d kiss well, I should think, if gently. She has good blood under her cheeks. Good, round breasts, too, even though they\u2019re small, they suit her.\u201d Amy didn\u2019t blush, and I hoped that she didn\u2019t understand what Isis was saying.\n            \u201cShe would have been worth it,\u201d Nepthys interrupted, \u201cif this fool hadn\u2019t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact. He was going to give us valuable information for her.\u201d\n            \u201cNow I understand why you\u2019re here,\u201d said Isis. \u201cSo what do you need to know?\u201d\n            \u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t come to you if I could get this information another way,\u201d said Nepthys apologetically.\n            \u201cMmm,\u201d she replied. I couldn\u2019t tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant.\n            \u201cI think that the person who stole the girl we\u2019re looking for might be a vampire. Isis \u2026you know some way to locate the undead, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n            \u201cI do. Describe this one to me. If I know him, I can find him. If not, you\u2019ll have to bring me something to work with.\u201d\n            Nepthys looked at me. I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin, his dark hair, the way that light seemed to flow around him, as best as I could. Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts. When I had told her all that I could remember, she blinked her black lashes and said, \u201cI remember him.\u201d\n            \u201cYou do?\u201d Nepthys could hardly believe her. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\n            \u201cIt is. I would have sworn to you that he was dead. He should be. I hope that you can do a better job than the last lot.\u201d She sat up, running her hands along her pale, round thighs. \u201cAll right, then. Let me see if I can find him.\u201d\n            Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands. A dark glow coalesced around her palms. Amy leaned forward, looking amazed. The glow reflected on her pink face, casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat-strong cheeks. Tiny drops of blood began to seep out of Isis\u2019 palms as her brow creased. Her candy lips twisted into a frown. The dark glow grew stronger and larger, filling the air for about a foot around her hands. In her palms, the droplets of blood swelled into small pools. \n            The dark glow began to flicker, and Isis\u2019 frown of concentration became one of worry. The pools in her hands grew deeper. She didn\u2019t shed a bead of sweat, and I didn\u2019t even see her draw a breath, but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame. Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake. The blood in her palms, still filling up, began to ripple. Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him. He glanced at me with honest concern, probably the first honest moment he\u2019d shown me: \u2018Is she all right?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know.\n            Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs. She gasped and the dark glow went out, taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam. Isis collapsed on the fur, strings cut. \n            Now Nepthys lunged forward, took her by the arms. \u201cIsis, what happened? Are you hurt?\u201d\n            She shook her head, rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d asked Nepthys.\n            She rolled onto her back, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. For the first time, she looked vulnerable. When she finally spoke, I had to lean close to hear her. \u201cI found your vampire,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he might know that someone\u2019s looking for him. He\u2019s taken great pains to keep himself hidden. You should look for him at Dvorov\u2019s as quickly as you can.\u201d She turned to me with tired sympathy. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a girl with him. Hurry, though, and you might find him before he leaves.\u201d A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants. \u201cOne of these will lead you out.\u201d\n            I stood, and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door. I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her. He stood to go, but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment. I turned back to the door. \u201cCome on, Amy,\u201d I said, \u201che\u2019ll be along soon.\u201d\n            Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall. When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood. He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes. \n            \u201cMountain ash,\u201d said Nepthys. \u201cThat was very kind of her.\u201d Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me. \u201cI really hope we find your Rachel,\u201d he said. It looked like he was going to continue, but then he walked out the door.\n            \u201cI know a quick way to Dvorov\u2019s,\u201d said Nepthys. \u201cI bet he\u2019s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me.\u201d In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we\u2019d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us. The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart.\n            \u201cYo, my man Nep! You got the sucker already?\u201d\n            \u201cNo, but we got a tip that he might be in your club. Have you seen him?\u201d\n            \u201cHere, man? You\u2019re crazy. I haven\u2019t had a vampire here since you and \u2013 \u201d Nepthys shot a wicked look at him. \u201cAnyway, long time, man.\u201d\n            \u201cThat\u2019s odd. Do you mind if we check it out anyway? I have a real feeling that he\u2019s in here somewhere.\u201d\n            Dvorov glanced over his shoulder, a little nervous. \u201cI guess, man, but be quick. I don\u2019t want my customers thinkin\u2019 that anything\u2019s wrong, you know?\u201d\n            \u201cOf course. We\u2019ll be in and out in a minute.\u201d Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor.\n            \u201cSo did you get anything out of the guy I sent you to?\u201d Dvorov asked us.\n            \u201cNo, he said that his research was purely academic, not for hunters.\u201d\n            \u201cBummer. I guess I probably should\u2019ve known, though. I mean, he is kinda tight about that stuff.\u201d He didn\u2019t look very surprised. \u201cAnyway, this is the dance floor, man. Good luck.\u201d\n            Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before. Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking.\n            I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd. Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into the wall, but I took a breath and kept moving. My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat. The music began to build, and a strobe came on. Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor, I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing \u2013 for a second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from the cold. Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me. I gathered her under my arm. Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons. \n            Just in front of me, a massive thing slammed into the wall, sending up a cloud of granite dust. It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf. Its haunches twitched in time to the music. As it started to rise, a man with thick, scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him. I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor.\n            Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers, I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this. I wasn\u2019t sure that I could survive the crush of the crowd. A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs. A woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me, fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing. Then a looming shape to my right fell away, and I saw him in a flash of the strobe, his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd. The creature blocking my vision moved back, but I had seen all that I needed to see. \n            A bleeding, eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me, but I ducked around it and toward the bar. I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before, a mountain of wet, veined flesh, and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm. \n            It was Dvorov. He pulled my ear down to his mouth. \u201cYou seen enough, man?\u201d he shouted.\n            \u201cYes,\u201d I called back, \u201cI saw him! He\u2019s sitting right there at the bar!\u201d\n            Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd, but it had shifted again and we couldn\u2019t see a thing. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s there,\u201d Dvorov shouted to me. \u201cIt must have been wishful thinking.\u201d\n            \u201cNo, I saw him! I have to hurry, too! Who knows how long he\u2019ll stick around?\u201d\n            \u201cListen, man, he\u2019s not there! I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not even worth checking the bar!\u201d I turned to keep going, but he caught my arm again. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, kid! It\u2019s a dumb idea. Even if you did find this vampire cat, he\u2019d tear you apart! If he got your girl, she\u2019s probably dead!\u201d I shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs, getting almost to the edge of the dance floor.\n            Suddenly, Amy screamed. I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away. His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off. The dancers near us tried to clear some space. He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back. He jumped at my arm while I was still off-balance, and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it\u2019s too late to save itself.\n            A heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up. On the floor was Dvorov\u2019s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood. Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand. It flashed in the strobe where it wasn\u2019t streaked with Dvorov\u2019s blood.\n            \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one with a secret or two,\u201d he said by way of explanation. \u201cYou spotted our boy, didn\u2019t you? I bet his hide-out is nearby, too. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip. The crowd parted for us.\n            The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us. In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room. \u201cCome on!\u201d shouted Nepthys.\n            We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us. He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held. Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories. He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me. I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us. Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment. Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight. \n            When I came to the door at the end of the room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges. I didn\u2019t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn\u2019t without alarm that I ran after him. \n            A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral. The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me. The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter. Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere. I couldn\u2019t tell how many people were running, much less where they were. On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women. Then I heard Nepthys shout, \u201cNathan! Behind you!\u201d I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head, leaping like a panther. He smashed into the pews behind me and I heard him leap across the rest of the row. There was Nepthys, on the other side of the pews, holding the wooden box in his hand. He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me.\n            I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes. He leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper, and drew a gleaming knife in midair. I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face. The blade lodged in the wood, its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin. My arms shook from the force of his throw. Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand. His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards. I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to drive the ash spike into his heart. Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews. I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me. I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine. The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw.\n            Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb. Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open. My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, \u201cThis one\u2019s blood isn\u2019t worth drinking.\u201d Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack.\n            I must have fallen to the floor then. I could perceive Nepthys\u2019 sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone. I thought I heard Rachel\u2019s voice blearily calling for me. Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar.\n            I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral\u2019s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek. A girl\u2019s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, \u201cNathan.\u201d I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected. Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake.\n            I stood and turned toward the altar. The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me. I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing. Then the stake came down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in. The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth.\n            Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug. I pulled the vial of liquid that he\u2019d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.\n            Rachel, her clothes torn and her face drawn, looked like she might cry when she saw me. I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me. \u201cMy fuckin\u2019 hero,\u201d she whispered. \n            \n         \n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "Nathans_Bylichka", "class": "fiction"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/fiction/The_Black_Willow", "text": "\n   \n      \n         \n            \n            \n            The Black Willow\n            \n            Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close. Opening a side drawer, he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot. After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards.\n            Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin. Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified \u2013 of course \u2013 by his very time away from her he loved best.\n            Although the concept was a simple one, Allan thought it had potential. Besides, the public liked a good, simple romance. Perhaps this will be more saleable, he thought and began to write.\n            \n            They gazed at each other, lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before. \"What about Roger?\" she asked, knowing that the answer no longer mattered.\n            \n            This is good, he thought, pausing to raise the low light of the lantern. I'm almost done, and the happy ending is just falling into place. I hardly dare to think it, but \u2013 I may finish this story!\n            As he thought this, a sinuous wind encircled the house, slipping through the walls to chill him. The papers and the lantern's flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allan's window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door. This was no stranger, however; the twisted, ancient thing was older than Allan, its branches rapping on his window since his childhood. Its thin, drawn fingers framed the bloated moon, whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly. The great, jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author, who gazed up through his window's tiny frame with trepidation. Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him. His pen flickered forth, words dancing out from its nib. In the author's eye gleamed the lantern's reflection \u2013 or was it a reflection? For while the lantern's spark shivered in the chill breeze, this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner's pen, scratching out the rhythm of the willow's fingers.\n            \n            The frenzied writing ceased at last, the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort. He held a hand to his forehead, eyes closed and face flushed. I did it again, he thought. After all that \u2013 so near the end, to lose control again. His breath returning to its normal rhythms, he dared to look at the page before him. \n            His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders. \"Come, darling,\" he whispered. \"Where I am to take you, one need never think of those left behind.\" \n            They stepped together into his carriage, her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt, conveyed as if through her skin, the unearthly nature of the rails and reins, the wheelspokes. They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting. For a few yards, they kicked up dust along the roadway; then they raised their hooves and took to the air. She gaped, afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand. The New England woods disappeared, even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky. Above them, the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached. A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky's glory.\n            \n            Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window. \"Damn you,\" he cried, \"will you never leave me be? Shall I never finish a story in peace?\" He pounded his desk in vain, cursing the foul muse that drove him.\n            \n            The next day, Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well-furnished parlor. Taking a measured sip of white wine from his crystal glass, he glanced at his host \u2013 a cultured man dressed in a light suit of the current fashion and wearing his pale hair with a heavy set of sideburns \u2013 who passed him a silver tray. \n            \"Cucumber sandwich?\"\n            Allan took a sandwich between his fingers. \"Thank you, Arthur.\"\n            Arthur replaced the tray onto the lacquered cherry table that stood in the center of his ordered chamber. In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial, he refilled their glasses. \"How is the writing these days, my dear Mr. Clemm?\"\n            \"Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason,\" Allan sighed. \"I had a perfect story in my pages; my hero returned home and reclaimed his love, I nearly had it tied together before\u2026\"\n            \"Before?\"\n            \"Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe \u2013 though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven.\"\n            Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation. \"I'm not familiar with Mr. Poe's works, but I assume you're referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic.\"\n            \"It's far from a 'penchant,' Arthur. This is more like a compulsion, a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment, then leaps and takes ahold of me, screaming out through my quill.\"\n            \"How perfectly awful.\" Arthur grimaced at the vivid description. \"I'm sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption.\"\n            \"I know,\" Allan replied, \"but how am I to do that? You know I do not wish to make my stories thus; but it is my nemesis, confronting me anew at every turn!\"\n            Arthur raised a critical brow. \"Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy. Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish. There simply is no audience for fairy tales \u2013 no literate audience, at least.\"\n            \"It is true,\" Allan admitted, fidgeting with his cufflinks, \"that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher. I've even tried rewriting the corrupted sections, but once my characters have gone down that road, nothing can recall their former life. My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road.\"\n            Arthur sighed and sipped his wine. \"If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours, you might write something really worth reading. It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print, like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd.\"\n            Allan hung his head, holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees. His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night, and his clothing had a rumpled look as if, by mere proximity, it had taken on the aspect of his weariness. He scratched the back of his dark-haloed head and blinked bleary eyes. \"I would drive it out,\" he said softly, \"but I fear for what would remain.\"\n            \"Perhaps you require a rest from writing,\" suggested Arthur. \"You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat, improve your disposition.\"\n            \"Perhaps it would,\" Allan replied, rising and vainly straightening his suit. \"I shall consider it; in the meantime, however, I must be off. You have been a gracious host, as always.\"\n            Arthur rose and shook his hand. \"So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home,\" he said. \"I hope soon to see you in better sorts.\"\n            They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate. He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust. Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo. \"Nathan?\" he called out to the empty road.\n            The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree. \"I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today,\" said Nathan, \"so I thought I'd wait here for you.\" Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton. His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy. \"So, Allan,\" said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, \"how goes life for the quintessential American author?\" \n            \"I wouldn't know,\" replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely. \"I destroyed another story last night, Nathan.\"\n            Leaning against his tree, Nathan shook his head. \"You mean, finished another story.\"\n            \"Yes, it is finished! Ended! Never again shall it see the rosy-fingered dawn! Nathan, you've read these abominations of mine. You know just as well as I that they have no future, no potential. At best, they are faery tales; at worst, expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see.\"\n            \"So instead, you would write \u2013 what?\"\n            \"Something saleable; something worth reading, worth writing! I want to write as others do: a tale, set in our real world, of characters who might live therein, not citizens of some airy demesne beyond the stars!\"\n            \"Why is that more desirable than what you write today?\"\n            \"People will read such stories; they are worth publishing.\"\n            \"If you never finish such stories, how can they be worth publishing?\"\n            \"That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct!\"\n            \"Why do you write?\"\n            \"\u2026Why \u2013 to earn a living, I suppose. Why do you ask?\"\n            \"You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter, though you face such difficulty. Why is that?\"\n            \"I suppose it is because I enjoy my craft. I would not be happy, thus separated from it.\"\n            \"So at its heart, then, your writing \u2013 as opposed to working otherwise \u2013 is for yourself?\"\n            \"Yes, I suppose one could see it thus. But really, Nathan, your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level.\"\n            Ignoring the statement, Nathan continued. \"Your writing is for you, Allan, not for the publishers or some imagined audience. Since you seem unable to write 'normally,' why not embrace your tales as they are, leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure? Your stories strike a chord with the deepest, most ancient stories of mankind, the tales basic to humanity. Tell them, and they will create an audience. You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are; speak, and they shall listen.\"\n            \n            Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank. He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. \n            His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. \n            \n            Arthur looked up from the results of a night\u2019s frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye.\n            \"What is this?\" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand.\n            \"I decided that\u2026 since I wasn't having much success with more \u2013 traditional \u2013 stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,\" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night. \n            \"What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,\" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. \"After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?\" He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son. \"This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!\" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. \"Do you hate the modern system of literature? Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare??\"\n            For a moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head. \"No, of course not\u2026 I\u2013 \"\n            \"Then why,\" Arthur barreled on, \"do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel? Why do you disregard my warnings, my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption, this literary debauchery?\" He glared at Allan, eyes impaling him and demanding a response.\n            \"Could you write decent tales with that willow at your window?\" Allan cried out at last, stepping forward and casting his arms open, confronting Arthur with this demanding, pleading interrogation. \"Its twigs rap constantly against the wall, the wind always demanding my attention. How could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door?\"\n            Arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author, viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was Arthur Mason. \"A tree? A tree forced you to write this, my dear Mr. Clemm? I must admit, this seems far-fetched, even by your standards \u2013 even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you.\"\n            \"You don't know what this is like,\" said Allan, shaking his head. \"Nathan would understand completely.\" Even as he said it, Allan prayed that his statement was true. \n            \"Very well,\" said Arthur; \"then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you. If you insist on abandoning me, I shall not hold you.\" With that, he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room.\n            Stunned, Allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order. He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken, making his way past his host's doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan's residence, several miles away.\n            \n            Nathan read the package of words in silence, his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages. Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period. At long last, Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them. Allan leaned forward unconsciously.\n            \"It's the best story you've ever written.\"\n            Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair, his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts. \"So,\" he asked, \"you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?\"\n            \"Heavens, no,\" said Nathan, aghast. \"This is one of the strongest works I've read in ages. It speaks to the deepest storyteller's instinct within us all, yet is entirely original. My dear friend, you have done it. Oh, they may rail against you at first; they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage; but while those in power say such things, others will read your tales and see their true worth. Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now.\"\n            Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from the compliment; mainly, it granted him the encouragement he still needed. Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face. He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight. Certainly, it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them. His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found the taste less bitter than expected. These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home.\n            It was evening, and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last. Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead. As Allan drew closer, he distinguished a new cloud, a pillar rising directly ahead; a road of smoke ascended in the west, its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door.\n            Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume. He ran the last distance, crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below, walking to the carriage parked before Allan's house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle's roof. Arthur paused in the door, looking up at Allan for a moment; then he turned and shut the door behind him. The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on. As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by the carriage, following it up the hillock and past himself. The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows. He watched as the carriage drew still more distant, the horses' hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway.\n            When they had gone, he remained, stunned, until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself. He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done.\n            Rounding the corner, he saw a great bonfire. A mass of flaming wood stood before him, heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house. It was a moment before he realized what else had changed: near the wall, beneath his window, was a stump with black and ancient bark.\n            In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre. His thoughts were not of the act's futility, nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was the tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake. His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers.\n            But he did not weep. Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all. Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood. He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath. \n            Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate. He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read? And without that torturous willow, he might be free to write whatever he saw fit. Indeed, if he still could not, he could at any time follow Arthur's advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality. Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind. He found himself along the bank of a low, wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current. As it turned to the deeper woods, elder giants rose above him: a beech, smooth bark a gray-green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark, cracked trunks of the nearer trees; great pines, a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three-stroke symbol of the British King; a towering black birch, leaves impossibly high above him. As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants. There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass.\n            Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks, Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped. Before him, roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream, grew a stand of black willows. Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet; the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees, still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers, sprang up where branches reached the ground. Though the elders' trunks fell and died, their children, first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead, continued unabated, a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors.\n            Allan stumbled forward, jaw slightly slack, until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted, three-trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself. Collapsing at its base, Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan, a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks, falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream, flowing through the ground beneath them.\n         \n      \n   \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "The_Black_Willow", "class": "fiction"}

One of these alarms was of a reported threat against Air Force One\n                itself, a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic\n                White House Situation Room that morning.\n            \n            While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington, by the time\n                Air Force One was airborne at 9:55 A.M. the Secret Service, the President's\n                advisers, and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising against it. President\n                Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and, at about 10:10, Air Force One changed\n                course and began heading due west. The immediate objective was to find a safe\n                location-not too far away-where the President could land and speak to the American\n                people. The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring\n                down the size of the traveling party. The President's military aide, an Air Force\n                officer, quickly researched the options and, sometime around 10:20, identified\n                Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination.\n            \n            When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45, personnel from the local\n                Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield. The motorcade consisted\n                of a military police lead vehicle and a van; the proposed briefing theater had no\n                phones or electrical outlets. Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the\n                President's remarks, while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security\n                situation with superiors in Washington. The President completed his statement, which\n                for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live, and the traveling party\n                returned to Air Force One. The next destination was discussed: once again the Secret\n                Service recommended against returning to Washington, and the Vice President agreed.\n                Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and\n                control facilities, and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for 50\n                persons. The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several\n                days, if necessary.\n            \n            Air Force One arrived at Offutt at 2:50 P.M. At about 3:15, President Bush met with\n                his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference.\n            \n            Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words, \"We're at war,\" and that Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said\n                the agency was still assessing who was responsible, but the early signs all pointed\n                to al Qaeda. That evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending\n                presidential directive they had labored over during the summer.\n            \n            The secretary of defense directed the nation's armed forces to Defense Condition 3,\n                an increased state of military readiness.\n            \n            For the first time in history, all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United\n                States were grounded, stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country.\n                Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had\n                been implemented.   The Pentagon had been struck; the White House or the Capitol had\n                narrowly escaped direct attack. Extraordinary security precautions were put in place\n                at the nation's borders and ports.\n            In the late afternoon, the President overruled his aides' continuing reluctance to\n                have him return to Washington and ordered Air Force One back to Andrews Air Force\n                Base. He was flown by helicopter back to the White House, passing over the\n                still-smoldering Pentagon. At 8:30 that evening, President Bush addressed the nation\n                from the White House. After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the\n                injured and protect against any further attacks, he said: \"We will make no\n                distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor\n                them.\" He quoted Psalm 23-\"though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death .\n                . .\" No American, he said,\"will ever forget this day.\"\n            \n            Following his speech, President Bush met again with his National Security Council\n                (NSC), expanded to include Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and Joseph\n                Allbaugh, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Secretary of\n                State Colin Powell, who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks, joined\n                the discussion. They reviewed the day's events.\n            \n            IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME\n            As the urgent domestic issues accumulated, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua\n                Bolten chaired a temporary \"domestic consequences\" group.\n            \n            The agenda in those first days is worth noting, partly as a checklist for future\n                crisis planners. It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the\n                flowing losses to the American economy, such as\n            \n                Organizing federal emergency assistance. One question was what kind of public\n                    health advice to give about the air quality in Lower Manhattan in the vicinity\n                    of the fallen buildings.\n                \n                Compensating victims. They evaluated legislative options, eventually setting\n                    up a federal compensation fund and defining the powers of a special master to\n                    run it.\n                Determining federal assistance. On September 13, President Bush promised to\n                    provide $20 billion for New York City, in addition to the $20 billion his budget\n                    director had already guessed might be needed for the country as a whole.\n                \n                Restoring civil aviation. On the morning of September 13, the national\n                    airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly improvised security\n                    standards.\n                Reopening the financial markets. After extraordinary emergency efforts\n                    involving the White House, the Treasury Department, and the Securities and\n                    Exchange Commission, aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually\n                    competitive firms of the financial industry, the markets reopened on Monday,\n                    September 17.\n                \n                Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal\n                    operations.\n                Evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry and cap its\n                    liability.\n            \n            The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective\n                government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems\n                of protection and preparedness. Though a number of agencies had some part of the\n                task, none had security as its primary mission. By September 14, Vice President\n                Cheney had decided to recommend, at least as a first step, a new White House entity\n                to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of\n                combining them in a new department. This new White House entity would be a homeland\n                security adviser and Homeland Security Council-paralleling the National Security\n                Council system. Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush and\n                other advisers. President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant-\n                Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge-in his address to a joint session of Congress on\n                September 20.\n            \n            Beginning on September 11, Immigration and Naturalization Service agents working in\n                cooperation with the FBI began arresting individuals for immigration violations whom\n                they encountered while following up leads in the FBI's investigation of the 9/11\n                attacks. Eventually, 768 aliens were arrested as \"special interest\" detainees. Some\n                (such as Zacarias Moussaoui) were actually in INS custody before 9/11; most were\n                arrested after. Attorney General John Ashcroft told us that he saw his job in\n                directing this effort as \"risk minimization,\" both to find out who had committed the\n                attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack. Ashcroft ordered all special interest\n                immigration hearings closed to the public, family members, and press; directed\n                government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were \"cleared\"\n                of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies; and ordered the identity of\n                the detainees kept secret. INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration\n                violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist\n                connections; in the chaos after the attacks, it was very difficult to reach law\n                enforcement officials, who were following up on other leads. The clearance process\n                approved by the Justice Department was time-consuming, lasting an average of about\n                80 days.\n            \n            We have assessed this effort to detain aliens of \"special interest.\" The detainees\n                were lawfully held on immigration charges. Records indicate that 531 were deported,\n                162 were released on bond, 24 received some kind of immigration benefits, 12 had\n                their proceedings terminated, and 8-one of whom was Moussaoui-were remanded to the\n                custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. The inspector general of the Justice\n                Department found significant problems in the way the 9/11 detainees were\n                    treated.\n            \n            In response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits of the 9/11 detainee\n                program, the Justice Department cited six individuals on the special interest\n                detainee list, noting that two (including Moussaoui) were linked directly to a\n                terrorist organization and that it had obtained new leads helpful to the\n                investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n            \n            A senior al Qaeda detainee has stated that U.S. government efforts after the 9/11\n                attacks to monitor the American homeland, including review of Muslims' immigration\n                files and deportation of nonpermanent residents, forced al Qaeda to operate less\n                freely in the United States.\n            \n            The government's ability to collect intelligence inside the United States, and the\n                sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement\n                communities, was not a priority before 9/11. Guidelines on this subject issued in\n                August 2001 by Deputy Attorney General LarryThompson essentially recapitulated prior\n                guidance. However, the attacks of 9/11 changed everything. Less than one week after\n                September 11, an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act (officially,\n                the USA PATRIOT Act) began to take shape.\n            \n            A central provision of the proposal was the removal of \"the wall\" on information\n                sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities (discussed in\n                chapter 3). Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action,\n                within the limits of the Constitution, to identify potential terrorists and deter\n                additional attacks.\n            \n            The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of\n                Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26.\n            \n            Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States\n            Three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the\n                United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11: (1) Did any flights of Saudi\n                nationals take place before national airspace reopened on September 13, 2001? (2)\n                Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals?\n                (3) Did the FBI screen Saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure?\n            First, we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals, domestic or\n                international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning\n                of September 13, 2001.   To the contrary, every flight we have identified occurred\n                after national airspace reopened.\n            \n            Second, we found no evidence of political intervention. We found no evidence that\n                anyone at the White House above the level of Richard Clarke participated in a\n                decision on the departure of Saudi nationals. The issue came up in one of the many\n                video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired, and Clarke said he\n                approved of how the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency\n                discussion at his level. Clarke told us, \"I asked the FBI, Dale Watson . . . to\n                handle that, to check to see if that was all right with them, to see if they wanted\n                access to any of these people, and to get back to me. And if they had no objections,\n                it would be fine with me.\" Clarke added,\"I have no recollection of clearing it with\n                anybody at the White House.\"\n            \n            Although White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card remembered someone telling him about\n                the Saudi request shortly after 9/11, he said he had not talked to the Saudis and\n                did not ask anyone to do anything about it. The President and Vice President told us\n                they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media.\n                None of the officials we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this\n                matter from any political appointee.\n            \n            Third, we believe that the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals\n                who left the United States on charter flights.\n            \n            The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBI's requirements that\n                passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights\n                departed.  The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI\n                operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals\n                and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart.\n            \n            The FBI interviewed all persons of interest on these flights prior to their\n                departures. They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11\n                attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion. Our own\n                independent review of the Saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known\n                links to terrorism departed on these flights.\n            \n            PLANNING FOR WAR\n            By late in the evening of September 11, the President had addressed the nation on the\n                terrible events of the day. Vice President Cheney described the President's mood as\n                somber.  The long day was not yet over. When the larger meeting that included his\n                domestic department heads broke up, President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top\n                advisers, a group he would later call his \"war council.\"  This group usually\n                included Vice President Cheney, Secretary of State Powell, Secretary of Defense\n                Donald Rumsfeld, General Hugh Shelton, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (later to\n                become chairman) General Myers, DCI Tenet, Attorney General Ashcroft, and FBI\n                Director Robert Mueller. From the White House staff, National Security Advisor\n                Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group, often joined\n                by their deputies, Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten.\n            In this restricted National Security Council meeting, the President said it was a\n                time for self-defense. The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of\n                the attacks, but also those who harbored them. Secretary Powell said the United\n                States had to make it clear to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Arab states that the\n                time to act was now. He said we would need to build a coalition. The President noted\n                that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China. Secretary\n                Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might\n                have harbored the attackers, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, and Iran. He\n                wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with\n                these countries, pointing out that major strikes could take up to 60 days to\n                    assemble.\n            \n            President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September 12. In the first\n                meeting, he stressed that the United States was at war with a new and different kind\n                of enemy. The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre-9/11 work and\n                develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them. As\n                they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign, they\n                considered a paper that went beyond al Qaeda to propose the \"elimination of\n                terrorism as a threat to our way of life,\" an aim that would include pursuing other\n                international terrorist organizations in the Middle East.\n            \n            Rice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September 13 in the Situation Room to\n                refine how the fight against al Qaeda would be conducted. The principals agreed that\n                the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm. The\n                United States would need to integrate diplomacy, financial measures, intelligence,\n                and military actions into an overarching strategy. The principals also focused on\n                Pakistan and what it could do to turn the Taliban against al Qaeda. They concluded\n                that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States, it too would be at\n                    risk.\n            \n            The same day, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage met with the Pakistani\n                ambassador to the United States, Maleeha Lodhi, and the visiting head of Pakistan's\n                military intelligence service, Mahmud Ahmed. Armitage said that the United States\n                wanted Pakistan to take seven steps:\n            \n                to stop al Qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical support for\n                    Bin Ladin;\n                to give the United States blanket overflight and landing rights for all\n                    necessary military and intelligence operations;\n                to provide territorial access to U.S. and allied military intelligence and\n                    other personnel to conduct operations against al Qaeda;\n                to provide the United States with intelligence information;\n                to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts;\n                to cut off all shipments of fuel to the Taliban and stop recruits from going\n                    to Afghanistan; and,\n                if the evidence implicated bin Ladin and al Qaeda and the Taliban continued to\n                    harbor them, to break relations with the Taliban government.\n                \n            \n            Pakistan made its decision swiftly. That afternoon, Secretary of State Powell\n                announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had\n                agreed to every U.S. request for support in the war on terrorism. The next day, the\n                U.S. embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders\n                had agreed to all seven demands.\" Pakistan will need full US support as it proceeds\n                with us,\" the embassy noted.\" Musharraf said the GOP [government of Pakistan] was\n                making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would\n                pay a domestic price. His standing in Pakistan was certain to suffer. To\n                counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his\n                    decisions.\"\n            \n            At the September 13 NSC meeting, when Secretary Powell described Pakistan's reply,\n                President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban. He also\n                ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the Taliban. The\n                President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban, step back, wait to see if\n                they got the message, and hit them hard if they did not. He made clear that the\n                military should focus on targets that would influence the Taliban's behavior.\n            \n            President Bush also tasked the State Department, which on the following day delivered\n                to the White House a paper titled \"Game Plan for a Political- Military Strategy for\n                Pakistan and Afghanistan.\" The paper took it as a given that Bin Ladin would\n                continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control. It\n                therefore detailed specific U.S. demands for the Taliban: surrender Bin Ladin and\n                his chief lieutenants, including Ayman al Zawahiri; tell the United States what the\n                Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations; close all terrorist camps; free all\n                imprisoned foreigners; and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions.\n            \n            The State Department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the Taliban: produce Bin\n                Ladin and his deputies and shut down al Qaeda camps within 24 to 48 hours, or the\n                United States will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure.\n                The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply. Therefore, State and\n                Defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan. Both\n                departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence,\n                basing, and other support from countries, according to their capabilities and\n                resources. Finally, the plan detailed a public U.S. stance: America would use all\n                its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat, punish those responsible for the\n                9/11 attacks, hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to\n                terrorists, work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks, and\n                avoid malice toward any people, religion, or culture.\n            \n            President Bush recalled that he quickly realized that the administration would have\n                to invade Afghanistan with ground troops.\n            \n            But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options\n                were disappointing.    Tommy Franks, the commanding general of Central Command\n                (CENTCOM), told us that the President was dissatisfied. The U.S. military, Franks\n                said, did not have an off-the-shelf plan to eliminate the al Qaeda threat in\n                Afghanistan. The existing Infinite Resolve options did not, in his view, amount to\n                such a plan.\n            \n            All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September\n                15-16, as President Bush convened his war council at Camp David.\n            \n            Present were Vice President Cheney, Rice, Hadley, Powell, Armitage, Rumsfeld,\n                Ashcroft, Mueller, Tenet, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and Cofer\n                Black, chief of the DCI's Counterterrorist Center.\n            Tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations. He\n                proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would\n                join the fight against al Qaeda.  These CIA teams would act jointly with the\n                military's Special Operations units. President Bush later praised this proposal,\n                saying it had been a turning point in his thinking.\n            \n            General Shelton briefed the principals on the preliminary plan for Afghanistan that\n                the military had put together. It drew on the Infinite Resolve \"phased campaign\"\n                plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November 2000 as an addition to the strike\n                options it had been refining since 1998. But Shelton added a new element-the\n                possible significant use of ground forces- and that is where President Bush\n                reportedly focused his attention.\n            \n            After hearing from his senior advisers, President Bush discussed with Rice the\n                contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion. Rice\n                prepared a paper that President Bush then considered with principals on Monday\n                morning, September 17. \"The purpose of this meeting,\" he recalled saying,\"is to\n                assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism. It starts today.\"\n            \n            In a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting,\n                President Bush charged Ashcroft, Mueller, and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland\n                defense. President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to deliver an ultimatum\n                to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed. The\n                State Department was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize Pakistan and to be\n                prepared to notify Russia and countries near Afghanistan when hostilities were\n                    imminent.\n            \n            In addition, Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action\n                in Afghanistan, including the administration's first Memorandum of Notification on\n                Bin Ladin. Shortly thereafter, President Bush authorized broad new authorities for\n                the CIA.\n            \n            President Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David\n                military plan to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the\n                ultimatum. The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to\n                protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented\n                worldwide. Finally, he directed Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to craft a plan to\n                target al Qaeda's funding and seize its assets.\n            \n            NSC staff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fund-raising by September\n                    18.\n            \n            Also by September 18, Powell had contacted 58 of his foreign counterparts and\n                received offers of general aid, search-and-rescue equipment and personnel, and\n                medical assistance teams.\n            \n            On the same day, Deputy Secretary of State Armitage was called by Mahmud Ahmed\n                regarding a two-day visit to Afghanistan during which the Pakistani intelligence\n                chief had met with Mullah Omar and conveyed the U.S. demands. Omar's response was\n                \"not negative on all these points.\" But the\n                administration knew that theTaliban was unlikely to turn over Bin Ladin.\n            \n            The pre-9/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive,\n                National Security Presidential Directive 9, now titled \"Defeating the Terrorist\n                Threat to the United States.\" The directive would now extend to a global war on\n                terrorism, not just on al Qaeda. It also incorporated the President's determination\n                not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them. It included a\n                determination to use military force if necessary to end al Qaeda's sanctuary in\n                Afghanistan. The new directive-formally signed on October 25, after the fighting in\n                Afghanistan had already begun-included new material followed by annexes discussing\n                each targeted terrorist group. The old draft directive on al Qaeda became, in\n                effect, the first annex.\n            \n            The United States would strive to eliminate all terrorist networks, dry up their\n                financial support, and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. The\n                goal was the \"elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life.\"\n            \n            \"PHASE TWO\" AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ\n            President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein's\n                regime might have had a hand in it. Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for\n                11 years, and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in\n                ongoing combat operations. As a former pilot, the President was struck by the\n                apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting, especially\n                Hanjour's high-speed dive into the Pentagon. He told us he recalled Iraqi support\n                for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well. Speculating about other possible states\n                that could be involved, the President told us he also thought about Iran.\n            \n            Clarke has written that on the evening of September 12, President Bush told him and\n                some of his staff to explore possible Iraqi links to 9/11. \"See if Saddam did this,\"\n                Clarke recalls the President telling them.\" See if he's linked in any way.\" While he believed the details of Clarke's account to be\n                incorrect, President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at\n                some point, asking him about Iraq.\n            \n            Responding to a presidential tasking, Clarke's office sent a memo to Rice on\n                September 18, titled \"Survey of Intelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in\n                the September 11 Attacks.\" Rice's chief staffer on Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad,\n                concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al\n                Qaeda. The memo found no \"compelling case\" that Iraq had either planned or\n                perpetrated the attacks. It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports,\n                including the Czech report alleging an April 2001 Prague meeting between Atta and an\n                Iraqi intelligence officer (discussed in chapter 7) and a Polish report that\n                personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad were told before\n                September 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event.\n                Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak, the memo pointed\n                out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein's regime. Finally, the\n                memo said, there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on\n                unconventional weapons.\n            \n            On the afternoon of 9/11, according to contemporaneous notes, Secretary Rumsfeld\n                instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible. The\n                notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking\n                empty training sites. He thought the U.S. response should consider a wide range of\n                options and possibilities. The secretary said his instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein\n                at the same time-not only Bin Ladin. Secretary Rumsfeld later explained that at the\n                time, he had been considering either one of them, or perhaps someone else, as the\n                responsible party.\n            \n            According to Rice, the issue of what, if anything, to do about Iraq was really\n                engaged at Camp David. Briefing papers on Iraq, along with many others, were in\n                briefing materials for the participants. Rice told us the administration was\n                concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks. She recalled that in\n                the first Camp David session chaired by the President, Rumsfeld asked what the\n                administration should do about Iraq. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for\n                striking Iraq during \"this round\" of the war on terrorism.\n            \n            A Defense Department paper for the Camp David briefing book on the strategic concept\n                for the war on terrorism specified three priority targets for initial action: al\n                Qaeda, theTaliban, and Iraq. It argued that of the three, al Qaeda and Iraq posed a\n                strategic threat to the United States. Iraq's long-standing involvement in terrorism\n                was cited, along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction.\n            \n            Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz-not Rumsfeld-argued that Iraq was ultimately\n                the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked.\n            \n            Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq was behind\n                9/11. \"Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt\n                with,\" Powell told us.\" And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to\n                deal with the Iraq problem.\" Powell said that President Bush did not give\n                Wolfowitz's argument \"much weight.\" Though continuing to\n                worry about Iraq in the following week, Powell said, President Bush saw Afghanistan\n                as the priority.\n            \n            President Bush told Bob Woodward that the decision not to invade Iraq was made at the\n                morning session on September 15. Iraq was not even on the table during the September\n                15 afternoon session, which dealt solely with Afghanistan.\n            \n            Rice said that when President Bush called her on Sunday, September 16, he said the\n                focus would be on Afghanistan, although he still wanted plans for Iraq should the\n                country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been\n                involved in the 9/11 attacks.\n            \n            At the September 17 NSC meeting, there was some further discussion of \"phase two\" of\n                the war on terrorism.\n            \n            President Bush ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if\n                Baghdad acted against U.S. interests, with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi\n                oil fields.\n            \n            Within the Pentagon, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for\n                dealing with Iraq. Writing to Rumsfeld on September 17 in a memo headlined\n                \"Preventing More Events,\"he argued that if there was even a 10 percent chance that\n                Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attack, maximum priority should be placed on\n                eliminating that threat. Wolfowitz contended that the odds were \"far more\" than 1 in\n                10, citing Saddam's praise for the attack, his long record of involvement in\n                terrorism, and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the\n                1993 attack on the World Trade Center.    The next day, Wolfowitz renewed the\n                argument, writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator in the\n                1995 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives-laden plane into CIA headquarters,\n                and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis' involvement in the\n                attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight. Given this background, he wondered why so\n                little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots, seeing a \"failure\n                of imagination\" and a mind-set that dismissed possibilities.\n            \n            On September 19, Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked\n                on their contingency plans. Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the\n                conflict, the references to specific enemies or regions named only the Taliban, al\n                Qaeda, and Afghanistan.\n            \n            Shelton told us the administration reviewed all the Pentagon's war plans and\n                challenged certain assumptions underlying them, as any prudent organization or\n                leader should do.\n            \n            General Tommy Franks, the commanding general of Central Command, recalled receiving\n                Rumsfeld's guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans\n                meant for his area of responsibility. He knew he would soon be striking the Taliban\n                and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. But, he told us, he now wondered how that action was\n                connected to what might need to be done in Somalia, Yemen, or Iraq.\n            \n            On September 20, President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the\n                two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead. When Blair asked about Iraq, the\n                President replied that Iraq was not the immediate problem. Some members of his\n                administration, he commented, had expressed a different view, but he was the one\n                responsible for making the decisions.\n            \n            Franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on\n                military responses in Iraq during the summer before 9/11-a request President Bush\n                denied, arguing that the time was not right. (CENTCOM also began dusting off plans\n                for a full invasion of Iraq during this period, Franks said.) The CENTCOM commander\n                told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi\n                moves shortly after 9/11, both because he personally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda\n                might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that Saddam might\n                take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern\n                or southern parts of Iraq, where the United States was flying regular missions to\n                enforce Iraqi no-fly zones. Franks said that President Bush again turned down the\n                    request.\n            \n            Having issued directives to guide his administration's preparations for war, on\n                Thursday, September 20, President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session\n                of Congress.\" Tonight,\" he said, \"we are a country awakened to danger.\" The President blamed al Qaeda for 9/11 and the 1998\n                embassy bombings and, for the first time, declared that al Qaeda was \"responsible\n                for bombing the USS Cole.\" He reiterated the ultimatum\n                that had already been conveyed privately.\" The Taliban must act, and act\n                immediately,\" he said.\" They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in\n                their fate.\" The President added that America's quarrel\n                was not with Islam: \"The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not\n                our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every\n                government that supports them.\" Other regimes faced hard choices, he pointed out:\n                \"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make: Either you are with us,\n                or you are with the terrorists.\"\n            \n            President Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin.\" Our war on terror\n                begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there,\" he said.\" It will not end until\n                every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.\" The\n                President had a message for the Pentagon:\"The hour is coming when America will act,\n                and you will make us proud.\" He also had a message for those outside the United\n                States.\" This is civilization's fight,\" he said. \"We ask every nation to join\n                    us.\"\n            \n            President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central\n                Command's General Franks and other advisers on September 21 and October 2.\n                Originally titled \"Infinite Justice,\" the operation's code word was changed-to avoid\n                the sensibilities of Muslims who associate the power of infinite justice with God\n                alone-to the operational name still used for operations in Afghanistan:\"Enduring\n                    Freedom.\"\n            \n            The plan had four phases.\n            \n                In Phase One, the United States and its allies would move forces into the\n                    region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as\n                    Uzbekistan and Pakistan. This occurred in the weeks following 9/11, aided by\n                    overwhelming international sympathy for the United States.\n                In Phase Two, air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al\n                    Qaeda and Taliban targets. In an innovative joint effort, CIA and Special\n                    Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan\n                    faction opposed to the Taliban. The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October\n                    7. The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially\n                    secured-after arduous effort-by the end of that month.\n                In Phase Three, the United States would carry out \"decisive operations\" using\n                    all elements of national power, including ground troops, to topple the Taliban\n                    regime and eliminate al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan. Mazar-e-Sharif, in\n                    northern Afghanistan, fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U.S. forces on\n                    November 9. Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul. By early December,\n                    all major cities had fallen to the coalition. On December 22, Hamid Karzai, a\n                    Pashtun leader from Kandahar, was installed as the chairman of Afghanistan's\n                    interim administration. Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the\n                    Taliban.\n            \n            In December 2001, Afghan forces, with limited U.S. support, engaged al Qaeda elements\n                in a cave complex called Tora Bora. In March 2002, the largest engagement of the war\n                was fought, in the mountainous Shah-i-Kot area south of Gardez, against a large\n                force of al Qaeda jihadists. The three-week battle was substantially successful, and\n                almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistan's equally mountainous\n                and lightly governed frontier provinces. As of July 2004, Bin Ladin and Zawahiri are\n                still believed to be at large.\n            \n                In Phase Four, civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task\n                    of what the armed forces call \"security and stability operations.\"\n            \n            Within about two months of the start of combat operations, several hundred CIA\n                operatives and Special Forces soldiers, backed by the striking power of U.S.\n                aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts, had\n                combined with Afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to\n                destroy theTaliban regime and disrupt al Qaeda. They had killed or captured about a\n                quarter of the enemy's known leaders. Mohammed Atef, al Qaeda's military commander\n                and a principal figure in the 9/11 plot, had been killed by a U.S. air strike.\n                According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy, the CIA\n                provided intelligence, experience, cash, covert action capabilities, and entr\u00e9e to\n                tribal allies. In turn, the U.S. military offered combat expertise, firepower,\n                logistics, and communications.\n            \n            With these initial victories won by the middle of 2002, the global conflict against\n                Islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle.\n        \n    \n", "mode": "written", "name": "chapter-10", "class": "govt-docs"}

Such a program, coupled\nwith appropriate measures to address local concerns, would provide\nsignificant health benefits even as we increase energy supplies and\nmaintain reasonable electricity rates.\nOur work on this issue has given us insight that I believe will\nbe helpful to you. The more I learn about the cost and\ninefficiencies of the current and future regulatory regime to which\npower generators will be subjected if we do not have new\nlegislation, the more I am convinced that we can --and must --\ndevelop a smarter approach that protects the environment and public\nhealth while reducing the cost to consumers and industry and\noptimizing the size of both the state and federal government\nmachinery necessary to achieve that protection. It is possible to\nachieve better results at lower costs,\nbut not if we simply add yet another program on top of all of\nthe existing regulations.\nThe current Clean Air Act has been enormously successful, but we\ncan do better. Significant cost savings can be achieved for power\ngenerators and consumers through a comprehensive legislative\npackage. I look forward to working with you to develop such an\napproach to reduce emissions from power generation. We applaud\nSenator Jeffords for tackling this important issue and for\nrecognizing that a cap and trade program is the best way to achieve\nthese reductions. However, we have significant concerns with S. 556\nas drafted. Our analysis to date suggests that it could increase\nconsumers' electricity rates by as much as 50%, which we believe is\nunacceptable. In addition, the combination of emission reductions\nand timing is not feasible and could threaten the reliability of\nelectricity supply. We are concerned that S. 556's short timeframes\nfor installation of controls could lead power plants to be taken\noff-line at important times, which could lead to electricity\nshortages.\nIn addition, there are a number of issues that Congress should\nconsider that S. 556 does not address. As drafted, S. 556 would\nmake some existing requirements unnecessary, but would not\neliminate them. Rather than add yet another layer of environmental\nregulations on top of the existing ones, we believe that S. 556\nshould eliminate those unnecessary existing requirements. S. 556\nalso does not have an allocation scheme. One lesson we should learn\nfrom the success of the Acid Rain cap and trade program is that\nwhen certain key issues can be resolved through clear legislation,\nwe can avoid years of litigation, business uncertainty and costs,\nand delayed environmental protection.\nFinally, and most importantly, the Administration strongly\nopposes including CO2 reductions in any multi-pollutant bill. The\nCO2 provisions in S. 556 will cost consumers too much and endanger\nour energy security by causing too much electricity generation to\nswitch from coal to natural gas. Greenhouse gas emissions should be\naddressed in the context of climate change, which is being\nundertaken by the President's Cabinet level working group. For all\nof these reasons, the Administration must oppose S. 556. In my\ntestimony today I will elaborate further on these key points.\n\n\nBackground \n\nOver the last 30 years, we have made substantial progress\ntowards improved environmental quality under the Clean Air Act.\nDuring this time, gross domestic product has increased almost 160%.\nAt the same time, we have reduced emissions of six key air\npollutants by 29%, while coal consumption has increased 77% and\nenergy consumption has increased 45%. Eleven years ago President\nGeorge H. W. Bush signed into law the most far reaching amendments\nto the Clean Air Act since its enactment in 1970. Included in those\namendments was the Acid Rain cap and trade program, the first\nprogram tailored specifically to the utility sector, which is\nachieving significant environmental and public health benefits at a\nfraction of the initial cost estimates and with relatively little\ngovernment bureaucracy. It is time to revisit and update the Clean\nAir Act once again in order to achieve the additional reductions\nneeded to address public health and environmental problems in the\nmost cost effective manner.\nThe Acid Rain Program is achieving its emission reduction goal\nat a fraction of the estimated costs because it allows and\nencourages innovative thinking and long range planning.1 The\nexisting program establishes a cap on SO2 emissions to ensure that\nthe environmental goal is met, and employs an innovative\nmarket-based allowance trading program to achieve the goal at\nlowest cost. Allowances are the currency with which compliance with\nthe SO2 emissions requirements is achieved. Sources, rather than\ngovernment, decide the most cost-effective way to use available\nresources to comply. Units that reduce their emissions below the\nnumber of allowances they hold may trade allowances with other\nunits in the system, sell them to other sources or save them for\nfuture use. There are neither restrictions on trading nor\ngovernment second-guessing.\nAllowance trading provides incentives for energy conservation\nand technology innovation that can both lower the cost of\ncompliance and yield pollution prevention benefits. Simply, the\nallowance market puts a price or value on each ton of SO2 not \nemitted. The association of a monetary value\nwith reduced emissions encourages innovation: in the 1990's,\nscrubber costs decreased by approximately 40% and scrubber sulfur\nremoval efficiencies improved from 90% to 95%, and experimentation\nled to the blending of fuels to lower emissions. To ensure that the\ncap is met and to provide credibility, sources also are required to\ninstall systems that continuously monitor and report emissions.\nThe Acid Rain Program has proven to be an excellent model for\ncap and trade programs. Compliance with the program has been nearly\n100 percent and annual emissions of SO2 from power plants have\nalready been reduced over 6 million tons (about 35 percent) from\n1980 levels. Greater reductions earlier than expected have lowered\nrisks to human health and provided benefits to the environment\nsooner. Acid rain levels were dramatically reduced over large areas\nof the U.S. and trading did not result in geographic shifting of\nemissions, or \"hot spots\", as some feared.\nDespite the significant progress we have made under the Clean\nAir Act, air emissions from power generators are still contributing\nto serious public health and environmental problems. Administrator\nWhitman addressed these concerns extensively in her testimony\nbefore you on July 26, 2001. Rather than reiterate her testimony, I\nwill emphasize just a few of her key points. Problems associated\nwith sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury\nemissions are of national and international significance, and the\ninterstate and long range transport of emissions continue to play\nsignificant roles in the nature and magnitude of the problems.\nEmission and deposition of SO2, NOx, and mercury and their\ntransformation byproducts are known to have a wide range of adverse\neffects on human health and the environment, including:\n\u2022 SO2 and NOx emissions contribute to fine particles, which are\nassociated with premature mortality, aggravated chronic bronchitis,\nhospitalizations due to cardio-respiratory symptoms, emergency room\nvisits due to aggravated asthma symptoms, and acute respiratory\nsymptoms.\n1 Governor Whitman's July 26, 2001, testimony before this\nCommittee contains a detailed discussion of the success of the Acid\nRain cap and trade program.\nFine particles formed from power plant emissions as well as\nmobile source emissions are of\nconcern. \u2022 NOx emissions contribute to ground-level ozone,\nwhich aggravates respiratory illnesses and causes lung\ninflammation, particularly for at-risk populations such as\nchildren, the elderly and those afflicted with asthma, emphysema,\nand other respiratory ailments.\n\u2022 Mercury emissions contribute to mercury deposition in water.\nChildren born to women who consume large amounts of\nmercury-contaminated fish while pregnant may be at risk for\nneurodevelopmental defects.\n\u2022 SO2 and NOx emissions contribute to atmospheric sulfate and\nnitrate concentrations that cause visibility impairment, including\nimpairment in many national parks and wilderness areas.\n\u2022 SO2 and NOx contribute to acid deposition, which damages\nlakes and streams, adversely affecting the fish and other species\nthat live in them, and leaches nutrients from the soil.\n\u2022 NOx emissions contribute to nitrogen deposition that may lead\nto eutrophication of estuaries and near-coastal waters and can\ndamage forested watersheds.\nEPA, states, and industry, working together, have made important\nstrides in addressing the adverse impacts of fossil fuel combustion\nby the electric power industry since the passage of the Clean Air\nAct in 1970. Despite significant improvements in air quality\nthroughout the country however, emissions from power generation\ncontinue to result in serious health, environmental and economic\nimpacts. In 1999, the electric power industry was responsible for\n67% of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25% of nitrogen oxide emissions,\nand 37% of mercury emissions in the United States.\n\n\nBusiness as Usual \n\nThe President's flexible, market-based approach to reducing\nemissions from power generators stands in sharp contrast to the\ncomplex web of existing regulations which currently confront the\nindustry. Over the years, Congress, EPA and the States have\nresponded to specific environmental and public health problems by\ndeveloping separate regulatory programs to address the specific\nproblems. Each individual program uses its own approach on its own\ntimeline to serve its own purpose. Absent changes to the Act, EPA\nand states will be forced to follow the same approach in future\nregulations. It is time to consolidate and simplify to achieve our\nclean air goals. A comprehensive legislative approach with\nmandatory caps could replace a good portion of the current\nregulatory requirements with a system that will reduce the\nadministrative burden on industry and governments, use market-based\napproaches to lower compliance costs, reduce consumers' costs, and\nincrease national energy security by providing the industry with\nmore certainty about its future regulatory obligations. By enacting\nsuch an approach, we can achieve environmental and public health\nprotection more effectively and at less cost. If we do it the\nPresident's way, it will be a win-win.\nThere are many regulations in place that will reduce air\nemissions from electric power generation. These regulations include\nboth federal and State requirements that address a variety of\nemissions including SO2, NOx, CO, PM10, and a number of hazardous\nair pollutants. These programs\ninclude the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for SO2,\nparticulate matter and ozone, the section 126 and the NOx SIP Call\nrules, the Acid Rain Program, new source review, new source\nperformance standards, and the regional haze rule.\nBut the regulation of power generators does not end with\nexisting regulations. EPA is obligated by a settlement agreement to\nissue by the end of 2004 a Maximum Achievable Control Technology\n(MACT) standard to require source-specific controls of mercury and\nother hazardous air pollutants from electric utilities. Emissions\nreductions are required by the end of 2007. States will also be\nrequiring utilities to comply with Best Available Retrofit\nTechnology (BART) programs (either source-specific standards or a\ntrading program) to meet requirements to reduce regional haze.\nIt is expected that the existing fine particle and ozone\nstandards now in place will also result in further regulation of\npower generators. Modeling shows that when full implementation of\nexisting regulations such as the acid rain program, the NOx SIP\nCall, the Tier II standards for cars and trucks, the heavy duty\ndiesel engine standards, and the low sulfur gasoline and diesel\nfuel rules are taken into account, additional reductions will be\nneeded to bring areas into attainment. States will be required to\ndevelop plans for these areas. In addition, NOx and SO2 reductions\nare also needed to reduce continuing damage from acid rain and\nnitrogen deposition.\nBecause states and EPA will have to find some way to\nsignificantly reduce NOx and SO2 emissions, it is probable that\npower generators will be required to reduce their emissions\nsignificantly. Power generation accounts for a significant\npercentage of these emissions, and our analysis shows that there\nare significant reductions available at lower cost than from other\nsources. Additionally, states know that if they do not get the\nreductions from power generators, they will have to impose\nsignificant reduction requirements on other local industrial and\ncommercial sources or impose local transportation control\nmeasures.\nUnder current law, the necessary reductions would be achieved\nthrough the development of individual state plans. States will not\njust control their own sources, however. They will be reaching out\nto control power generators and large industrial facilities in\nother states because transport from other states contributes to\nboth ozone and fine particle pollution in many areas. This is what\nhas happened in the eastern part of the country when states\nrealized that emissions from sources in other states were\nsignificantly contributing to their 1-hour ozone non-attainment\nproblems. Under section 126 of the Clean Air Act, a state can\npetition EPA and request that EPA require reductions from sources\noutside the petitioning state's borders. The petitioning state is\nentitled to relief if EPA finds that the sources are significantly\ncontributing to the petitioning state's nonattainment problem.\nEPA's requirement, adopted in response to section 126 petitions,\nthat sources in a number of eastern states reduce NOx emissions was\nrecently upheld by the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit. Since states now know that EPA has authority to\naddress transport pollution through responses to 126 petitions or\nby issuing a rule like the NOx SIP Call, we anticipate that states\nwill be turning to these types of control approaches early in the\nSIP process. Although those of us who are\ntraveling that path with the current 126 petitions and NOx SIP\nCall believe it will eventually take us to our environmental goal,\nit has been -- and still is -- a very rocky road for industry,\nenvironmentalists, the states, EPA and other stakeholders.\nThis one-at-a-time, uncoordinated series of regulatory\nrequirements for the power industry is not the optimal approach for\nthe environment, the power generation sector, or American\nconsumers. With most plants needing to install control equipment to\nmeet these requirements, it is likely that this approach would lead\nto installation of controls that become obsolete and stranded\ncapital investments as additional requirements are promulgated.\nFurther, the attainment efforts of individual States and localities\nnot only impose costs on these entities, but also can increase\ncomplexity for companies which face differing requirements when\noperations cross state lines. These factors are exacerbated by\nlimited timeframes that may constrain available compliance options\nand thwart long range planning. These and other inefficiencies\npoint to the need for a nationally coordinated approach that could\nreduce cost while improving environmental progress and\naccountability.\n\n\nChanging the Way We Do Business: Certainty, Flexibility,\nAccountability and Innovation \n\nWe believe there is a better way, one that could cost American\nconsumers and industry far less than under current law and ensure\nprotection of the air we breathe in a far more certain,\nstraightforward manner. I know that many members of this Committee\nshare that belief and are also working to develop such an approach.\nIt would provide power generators with more certainty about their\nregulatory future and thus allow them to make wiser decisions about\ninvestments in new technology, which would improve energy security.\nThis Administration is developing such a proposal. It will build on\nthe successes of the Acid Rain cap and trade program. It would\nestablish national cap-and-trade programs for NOx, SO2 and mercury\nemissions from power generators (with appropriate measures to\naddress local concerns). Such an approach will benefit the power\ngeneration industry, the economy, and the states, while improving\npublic health and the environment.\nUp-front knowledge of future requirements for multiple\npollutants would lead firms to follow significantly different and\nless expensive compliance strategies at individual plants, compared\nwith compliance choices which must be made as requirements are\naddressed in a sequential manner under the current law. The savings\ncome from the opportunity to make cost-effective plant investment\nand retirement decisions with full knowledge of upcoming SO2, NOx\nand mercury requirements, rather than investing in \"add-on\" control\nequipment to meet the requirements of each regulation. Integration,\nadvance knowledge, and certainty regarding environmental\nrequirements will have even greater value over the coming decade as\nthe electric power industry undergoes further structural changes.\nAn integrated package of measures that addresses both the existing\nregulatory requirements as well as many future environmental needs\nwould provide the greatest degree of certainty and flexibility for\nthe industry, while achieving the necessary emission reductions at\nlower cost than under current law.\nIn exchange for flexibility in methods to control emissions, a\nfull accounting of emissions through\ncontinuous monitoring and reporting is essential, as well as\nsignificant consequences for failing to comply. Such provisions\nhave been critical to the success of the Acid Rain Program,\nencouraging individual sources to find the most cost-effective\nmeans of compliance with the collective emission reduction\ngoal.\nFlexibility stimulates technological innovation, fuels economic\nactivity and reduces cost to industry and consumers. Strategies and\ntechnologies for the control of SO2, NOx and mercury emissions\nexist now, and improved methods are expected to become available\nover the next several years. The air pollution control and\nmonitoring technology industry is expected to continue to respond\nwith cost-effective compliance solutions just as they have done for\nthe past 30 years. A predictable demand for such jobs over the next\n15 years is preferable to the boom and bust cycle created by the\ncurrent regulatory approach.\nThis approach also would reduce states' administrative burdens\nand obligations. A national cap and trade program with appropriate\ncaps for NOx and SO2 could provide the emission reductions\nnecessary to bring a significant number of areas into attainment\nwith the ozone and fine particle standards. Even those areas that\nwould not be brought into attainment by these caps would need\nsignificantly fewer emission reductions to come into attainment.\nOur approach would significantly reduce the state resources needed\nto conduct modeling, planning and regulatory activities to attain\nthe standards. Additionally, the Acid Rain cap and trade program is\nadministered with a relatively small staff relying on strong,\nstate-of-the-art data tracking and reporting capabilities. Thus,\nwell-designed national cap and trade programs can help use\ngovernment resources and taxpayer dollars more efficiently at both\nthe state and federal level.\nCaps ensure that environmental goals are met. A cap that\nrepresents significant reductions of emissions protects the\nenvironment by reducing overall loadings. Consideration of local\nconcerns is important in conjunction with trading provisions.\nTherefore, the National Energy Plan recommended that the\nAdministration's approach include appropriate measures to address\nlocal concerns, such as the unlikely occurrence of an SO2 \"hot\nspot\" or area of concentrated emissions. Significant reductions\nwill go a long way towards addressing local concerns. In addition,\nEPA will be conducting modeling that will predict where emissions\nreductions will occur. Under the Acid Rain cap and trade program,\nwe have not seen local hot spots because the highest emitters are\noften the most cost-effective to control and therefore, the most\nlikely to control.\nAs I mentioned, EPA and the Administration are still in the\nprocess of developing our proposal. Several guidelines are shaping\nour efforts. These guidelines may provide a valuable basis as you\nweigh the proposals before you. They will also guide our assessment\nof other proposals, including S. 556. These principles are\nstructured to ensure consistency with the NEP objectives. The NEP\ngoals of increasing energy supplies, accelerating the protection\nand improvement of the environment, and increasing our nation's\nenergy supply must be advanced. Towards that end, energy diversity,\nthe preservation of electricity generation and transmission\nreliability, and improvement of energy\n9 efficiency/energy intensity of the electric power industry\nshould be a key consideration. In particular, to prevent the\nreoccurrence of energy shortages and price volatility, a diverse\nmix of fuel sources should be maintained.\n\n\nSpecific Comments on S. 556 \n\nWe share the desire expressed in S. 556 to significantly reduce\nand cap emissions of SO2, NOx and mercury from power generation. We\napplaud your acknowledgment of market-based incentives,\nparticularly cap and trade systems, as a powerful tool in\nenvironmental protection. In this way, S. 556 builds on successful\nelements of the Clean Air Act.\nWe do, however, oppose S. 556 because of concerns with the bill\n-- both with some provisions that are in the bill and with some\nthat are missing. We believe the emission reductions and timing in\nthe bill will be too costly for consumers and will endanger\nnational energy security. We believe the bill is missing some\nprovisions -- it should address the allocation scheme and\nintegration with existing programs. Finally, we oppose inclusion of\nCO2 in this bill.\nFirst, let me explain some of our specific concerns about the\nSO2, NOx, and mercury provisions in the bill. We are concerned that\nthe significant emissions reductions are required too quickly. We\ndo not believe it is reasonable to expect all the control\ntechnology installations to be completed in that time frame without\nvery high costs and electricity reliability problems. To meet these\ndeadlines, facilities may need to be taken off-line during critical\nperiods. Reliability problems could arise as large amounts of\ncapacity are taken out of service for extended periods of time to\ninstall the control equipment necessary to meet the emissions\nreduction requirements. The abbreviated time frame would force many\ngenerators to make these retrofits simultaneously. This would\nsignificantly reduce the amount of generating capacity available to\nmeet consumer' electrical needs.\nWe have not modeled the specific provisions in S. 556, but\nuseful information is provided by comparing the analyses EPA and\nEIA conducted to respond to a request from Senators Smith,\nVoinovich and Brownback with the analyses responding to a request\nfrom Senators Jeffords and Lieberman. In the\nSmith/Voinovich/Brownback analysis, when we analyzed SO2 and NOx\nreduction levels similar to S. 556, mercury reduction levels more\nmodest than S. 556 and no CO2 reductions, we did not find\nsignificant impacts on coal production or electricity prices.\nHowever, in the analysis responding to the Jeffords/Lieberman\nrequest that had NOx, SO2, mercury and CO2 reduction levels similar\nto S. 556, we found significant ramifications: approximately a\n20-30% decline of coal generation and a 30-50% increase in\nelectricity prices compared to the reference case (depending on\nassumptions of energy technology penetration).\nThe 90% source-specific control for mercury is also problematic.\nWe have not seen anything that demonstrates that every coal-fired\npower plant would be able to achieve 90% source-specific controls\nfor mercury by 2007, without considerable fuel switching, which\nwould be very disruptive to our economy and undermine energy\nsecurity. In addition, requiring the same level of reduction at\na\nplant that emits 0.1 pounds of mercury and a plant that emits\n2000 pounds of mercury - regardless of cost - is neither efficient\nnor necessary.\nWe are also very concerned about the \"outdated power plant\"\nprovision. Requiring every plant over 30 years old to meet New\nSource Performance Standards and New Source Review modification\nrequirements seems unnecessary and could undermine the benefits of\nthe cap and trade approach. Allowing sources to make reductions\nwhere it is most economical to do so is one of the reasons cap and\ntrade programs should be less costly than command-and-control\nprograms that achieve the same or even fewer reductions. When you\nhave a hard cap, as you would under S. 556, requiring emission\nreductions at a specific source does not reduce the overall level\nof pollution, it just limits industry's flexibility about where to\nmake the reductions. Layering additional requirements, such as the\n\"outdated power plants\" provision, on top of a cap and trade\nprogram is very likely to increase costs without providing\nsignificant environmental benefits.\nSecond, we have concerns about what is not in S. 556. Comparing\nour experience on the Acid Rain Program with the NOx SIP Call and\nthe Section 126 petitions demonstrates the benefit of having\ncertain key issues decided by Congress rather than left to Agency\nrulemakings. Congressional resolution of key issues simplifies\nwhatever Agency rulemaking is needed and decreases the\nopportunities for the program to get tied up in protracted\nlitigation.\nPerhaps the most important program element not addressed in the\nbill is integration of this new program with the existing Clean Air\nAct provisions. An effective market-based approach would make some\nexisting provisions of the Clean Air Act unnecessary. For example,\ndepending on the ultimate cap levels chosen by Congress, this type\nof legislation would obviate the need for Best Available Retrofit\nTechnology requirements, mercury MACT, and new source review\ncase-by-case technology requirements for power generators.\nAlso missing from S. 556 is the scheme for allocating\nallowances. Developing an allocation scheme requires answering\nnumerous questions. Should the allowances be auctioned off or be\nhanded out for free? If they are not auctioned, should they be\nallocated based on heat input or electrical and steam output?\nShould power generators that do not emit air pollutants (e.g.,\nhydropower facilities) be given allowances? Should allowance\nallocations be updated, and if so, how frequently? Should\nallocations be fuel neutral? Imbedded in these and other questions\nare important environmental and energy policy choices with\nsignificant equity consequences. It may not be efficient for EPA to\nmake these choices in rulemaking.\nThere are other issues as well that this Committee should\nconsider, such as coordination with existing state and regional\nprograms like the Western Regional Air Partnership and the NOx\nreduction programs in the east. The Committee may also wish to\nconsider provisions to track environmental progress to evaluate the\nefficacy of the program this bill would establish.\nFinally, the Administration strongly opposes including\nreductions for CO2 in S. 556 or any multi-pollutant bill. Pursuing\nsharp reductions in CO2 from the electricity generating sector\nalone would cause a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas and\nthus would run the risk of endangering national energy security,\nsubstantially increasing energy prices and harming consumers.\nThe Administration will not support any legislation that would\ncause a significant decline in our nation's ability to use coal as\na major source of current and future electricity. At the same time,\nthe Administration will not support any legislation that does not\nenhance the cleanliness of coal-fired electricity generation and\npromote a future for clean coal technologies. In short, the\nAdministration supports a clean coal policy as a critical component\nof our nation's energy and environmental policies, recognizing that\nother sources of energy also have a critical role to play.\nAdditionally, as Governor Whitman said when she testified before\nyou in July, including CO2 in this bill will slow down, if not\nprevent, the consensus necessary for passage of legislation to\ncontrol multiple emissions from power plants. Governor Whitman and\nI both believe consensus on the appropriate levels and timing for\nreductions of NOx, SO2 and mercury is achievable relatively soon.\nWe should not delay the public health and environmental benefits\nfrom reduction of these emissions while we wait for consensus to\ndevelop on CO2.\nWe agree that climate change is a serious issue we need to\naddress. However, CO2 has never been regulated as a pollutant under\nthe Clean Air Act and does not pose any direct threat to human\nhealth unlike NOx, SO2 and mercury. The current body of scientific\nknowledge does not provide information regarding atmospheric\nconcentrations of CO2 or reduction levels necessary to prevent\ndangerous interference with the climate system.\nIn April, the President convened a Cabinet-level policy review\nof this issue and was provided with initial recommendations that he\naccepted and announced on June 11. In that regard, the\nAdministration is implementing two major initiatives on climate\nscience and advanced energy and sequestration technologies. The\nUnited States now spends $1.6 billion annually on climate science\nto reduce uncertainties - a commitment unmatched by any other\nnation. The \"National Climate Change Technology Initiative\" will\naccelerate priority research and the application of advanced energy\nand sequestration technologies, recognizing that the real answer to\naddressing climate change in the long term lies in the development\nand global introduction of such technologies in this century. And\nthe cabinet-level policy review is ongoing. Finally, as greenhouse\ngas emissions are projected to grow exponentially in the developing\nworld in the next two decades, we must evaluate the costs of\nimposing domestic reductions as a very high cost against\npotentially low-cost opportunities for mitigating and sequestering\ncarbon emissions in the developing world.\nWe appreciate the role of S. 556 in generating important\ndiscussions and emphasizing the importance of a new approach to\ncontrolling emissions in the power sector. I look forward to the\nadditional hearings you will need to address these important issues\nand to working with the Committee\nto develop an approach that the President can support.\nThe history of Clean Air Act legislation is one of great\naccomplishments made possible by bipartisan efforts. I thank you\nfor the opportunity to work with you to continue that great\ntradition.\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "Env_Prot_Agency-nov1", "class": "govt-docs"}

We are keenly aware of the significance of our charge, given the \neconomic damage that America has suffered in the wake of the greatest financial crisis \nsince the Great Depression. \n\nOur task was first to determine what happened and how it happened so that we \ncould understand why it happened. Here we present our conclusions. We encourage \nthe American people to join us in making their own assessments based on the evidence \ngathered in our inquiry. If we do not learn from history, we are unlikely to fully \nrecover from it. Some on Wall Street and in Washington with a stake in the status quo \nmay be tempted to wipe from memory the events of this crisis, or to suggest that no \none could have foreseen or prevented them. This report endeavors to expose the \nfacts, identify responsibility, unravel myths, and help us understand how the crisis \ncould have been avoided. It is an attempt to record history, not to rewrite it, nor allow \nit to be rewritten. \n\nTo help our fellow citizens better understand this crisis and its causes, we also present \nspecific conclusions at the end of chapters in Parts III, IV, and V of this report. \n\nThe subject of this report is of no small consequence to this nation. The profound \nevents of 2007 and 2008 were neither bumps in the road nor an accentuated dip in \nthe financial and business cycles we have come to expect in a free market economic \nsystem. This was a fundamental disruption\u2014a financial upheaval, if you will\u2014that \nwreaked havoc in communities and neighborhoods across this country. \n\nAs this report goes to print, there are more than 26 million Americans who are \nout of work, cannot find full-time work, or have given up looking for work. About \nfour million families have lost their homes to foreclosure and another four and a half \nmillion have slipped into the foreclosure process or are seriously behind on their \nmortgage payments. Nearly $11 trillion in household wealth has vanished, with retirement \naccounts and life savings swept away. Businesses, large and small, have felt \nthe sting of a deep recession. There is much anger about what has transpired, and justifiably \nso. Many people who abided by all the rules now find themselves out of work \nand uncertain about their future prospects. The collateral damage of this crisis has \nbeen real people and real communities. The impacts of this crisis are likely to be felt \nfor a generation. And the nation faces no easy path to renewed economic strength. \n\nLike so many Americans, we began our exploration with our own views and some \npreliminary knowledge about how the world\u2019s strongest financial system came to the \nbrink of collapse. Even at the time of our appointment to this independent panel, \nmuch had already been written and said about the crisis. Yet all of us have been \ndeeply affected by what we have learned in the course of our inquiry. We have been at \nvarious times fascinated, surprised, and even shocked by what we saw, heard, and \nread. Ours has been a journey of revelation. \n\nMuch attention over the past two years has been focused on the decisions by the \nfederal government to provide massive financial assistance to stabilize the financial \nsystem and rescue large financial institutions that were deemed too systemically important \nto fail. Those decisions\u2014and the deep emotions surrounding them\u2014will be \ndebated long into the future. But our mission was to ask and answer this central question: \nhow did it come to pass that in 2008 our nation was forced to choose between two \nstark and painful alternatives\u2014either risk the total collapse of our financial system \nand economy or inject trillions of taxpayer dollars into the financial system and an \narray of companies, as millions of Americans still lost their jobs, their savings, and \ntheir homes? \n\nIn this report, we detail the events of the crisis. But a simple summary, as we see \nit, is useful at the outset. While the vulnerabilities that created the potential for crisis \nwere years in the making, it was the collapse of the housing bubble\u2014fueled by \nlow interest rates, easy and available credit, scant regulation, and toxic mortgages\u2014 \nthat was the spark that ignited a string of events, which led to a full-blown crisis in \nthe fall of 2008. Trillions of dollars in risky mortgages had become embedded \nthroughout the financial system, as mortgage-related securities were packaged, \nrepackaged, and sold to investors around the world. When the bubble burst, hundreds \nof billions of dollars in losses in mortgages and mortgage-related securities \nshook markets as well as financial institutions that had significant exposures to \nthose mortgages and had borrowed heavily against them. This happened not just in \nthe United States but around the world. The losses were magnified by derivatives \nsuch as synthetic securities. \n\nThe crisis reached seismic proportions in September 2008 with the failure of \nLehman Brothers and the impending collapse of the insurance giant American International \nGroup (AIG). Panic fanned by a lack of transparency of the balance sheets of major \nfinancial institutions, coupled with a tangle of interconnections among institutions \nperceived to be \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d caused the credit markets to seize up. Trading ground \nto a halt. The stock market plummeted. The economy plunged into a deep recession. \n\nThe financial system we examined bears little resemblance to that of our parents\u2019 \ngeneration. The changes in the past three decades alone have been remarkable. The \nfinancial markets have become increasingly globalized. Technology has transformed \nthe efficiency, speed, and complexity of financial instruments and transactions. There \nis broader access to and lower costs of financing than ever before. And the financial \nsector itself has become a much more dominant force in our economy. \n\nFrom 1978 to 2007, the amount of debt held by the financial sector soared from \n$3 trillion to $36 trillion, more than doubling as a share of gross domestic product. \nThe very nature of many Wall Street firms changed\u2014from relatively staid private \npartnerships to publicly traded corporations taking greater and more diverse kinds of \nrisks. By 2005, the 10 largest U.S. commercial banks held 55% of the industry\u2019s assets, \nmore than double the level held in 1990. On the eve of the crisis in 2006, financial \nsector profits constituted 27% of all corporate profits in the United States, up from \n15% in 1980. Understanding this transformation has been critical to the Commission\u2019s \nanalysis. \n\nNow to our major findings and conclusions, which are based on the facts contained \nin this report: they are offered with the hope that lessons may be learned to \nhelp avoid future catastrophe. \n\nWe conclude this financial crisis was avoidable. The crisis was the result of human \naction and inaction, not of Mother Nature or computer models gone haywire. The \ncaptains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings \nand failed to question, understand, and manage evolving risks within a system essential \nto the well-being of the American public. Theirs was a big miss, not a stumble. \nWhile the business cycle cannot be repealed, a crisis of this magnitude need not have \noccurred. To paraphrase Shakespeare, the fault lies not in the stars, but in us. \nDespite the expressed view of many on Wall Street and in Washington that the \ncrisis could not have been foreseen or avoided, there were warning signs. The tragedy \nwas that they were ignored or discounted. There was an explosion in risky subprime \nlending and securitization, an unsustainable rise in housing prices, widespread reports \nof egregious and predatory lending practices, dramatic increases in household \nmortgage debt, and exponential growth in financial firms\u2019 trading activities, unregulated \nderivatives, and short-term \u201crepo\u201d lending markets, among many other red \nflags. Yet there was pervasive permissiveness; little meaningful action was taken to \nquell the threats in a timely manner. \n\nThe prime example is the Federal Reserve\u2019s pivotal failure to stem the flow of toxic \nmortgages, which it could have done by setting prudent mortgage-lending standards. \nThe Federal Reserve was the one entity empowered to do so and it did not. The \nrecord of our examination is replete with evidence of other failures: financial institutions \nmade, bought, and sold mortgage securities they never examined, did not care \nto examine, or knew to be defective; firms depended on tens of billions of dollars of \nborrowing that had to be renewed each and every night, secured by subprime mortgage \nsecurities; and major firms and investors blindly relied on credit rating agencies \nas their arbiters of risk. What else could one expect on a highway where there were \nneither speed limits nor neatly painted lines? \n\nWe conclude widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision \nproved devastating to the stability of the nation\u2019s financial markets. The sentries \nwere not at their posts, in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self-\ncorrecting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively \npolice themselves. More than 30 years of deregulation and reliance on self-regulation \nby financial institutions, championed by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan \nGreenspan and others, supported by successive administrations and Congresses, and \nactively pushed by the powerful financial industry at every turn, had stripped away \nkey safeguards, which could have helped avoid catastrophe. This approach had \nopened up gaps in oversight of critical areas with trillions of dollars at risk, such as \nthe shadow banking system and over-the-counter derivatives markets. In addition, \nthe government permitted financial firms to pick their preferred regulators in what \nbecame a race to the weakest supervisor. \nYet we do not accept the view that regulators lacked the power to protect the financial \nsystem. They had ample power in many arenas and they chose not to use it. \nTo give just three examples: the Securities and Exchange Commission could have required \nmore capital and halted risky practices at the big investment banks. It did not. \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other regulators could have clamped \ndown on Citigroup\u2019s excesses in the run-up to the crisis. They did not. Policy makers \nand regulators could have stopped the runaway mortgage securitization train. They \ndid not. In case after case after case, regulators continued to rate the institutions they \noversaw as safe and sound even in the face of mounting troubles, often downgrading \nthem just before their collapse. And where regulators lacked authority, they could \nhave sought it. Too often, they lacked the political will\u2014in a political and ideological \nenvironment that constrained it\u2014as well as the fortitude to critically challenge the \ninstitutions and the entire system they were entrusted to oversee. \n\nChanges in the regulatory system occurred in many instances as financial markets \nevolved. But as the report will show, the financial industry itself played a key \nrole in weakening regulatory constraints on institutions, markets, and products. It \ndid not surprise the Commission that an industry of such wealth and power would \nexert pressure on policy makers and regulators. From 1999 to 2008, the financial \nsector expended $2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses; individuals and \npolitical action committees in the sector made more than $1 billion in campaign \ncontributions. What troubled us was the extent to which the nation was deprived of \nthe necessary strength and independence of the oversight necessary to safeguard \nfinancial stability. \n\nWe conclude dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management \nat many systemically important financial institutions were a key cause of this crisis. \nThere was a view that instincts for self-preservation inside major financial firms \nwould shield them from fatal risk-taking without the need for a steady regulatory \nhand, which, the firms argued, would stifle innovation. Too many of these institutions \nacted recklessly, taking on too much risk, with too little capital, and with too \nmuch dependence on short-term funding. In many respects, this reflected a fundamental\nchange in these institutions, particularly the large investment banks and bank \nholding companies, which focused their activities increasingly on risky trading activities \nthat produced hefty profits. They took on enormous exposures in acquiring and \nsupporting subprime lenders and creating, packaging, repackaging, and selling trillions \nof dollars in mortgage-related securities, including synthetic financial products. \nLike Icarus, they never feared flying ever closer to the sun. \n\nMany of these institutions grew aggressively through poorly executed acquisition \nand integration strategies that made effective management more challenging. The \nCEO of Citigroup told the Commission that a $40 billion position in highly rated \nmortgage securities would \u201cnot in any way have excited my attention,\u201d and the cohead \nof Citigroup\u2019s investment bank said he spent \u201ca small fraction of 1%\u201d of his time \non those securities. In this instance, too big to fail meant too big to manage. \n\nFinancial institutions and credit rating agencies embraced mathematical models \nas reliable predictors of risks, replacing judgment in too many instances. Too often, \nrisk management became risk justification. \n\nCompensation systems\u2014designed in an environment of cheap money, intense \ncompetition, and light regulation\u2014too often rewarded the quick deal, the short-term \ngain\u2014without proper consideration of long-term consequences. Often, those systems \nencouraged the big bet\u2014where the payoff on the upside could be huge and the downside \nlimited. This was the case up and down the line\u2014from the corporate boardroom \nto the mortgage broker on the street. \n\nOur examination revealed stunning instances of governance breakdowns and irresponsibility. \nYou will read, among other things, about AIG senior management\u2019s ignorance \nof the terms and risks of the company\u2019s $79 billion derivatives exposure to \nmortgage-related securities; Fannie Mae\u2019s quest for bigger market share, profits, and \nbonuses, which led it to ramp up its exposure to risky loans and securities as the housing \nmarket was peaking; and the costly surprise when Merrill Lynch\u2019s top management \nrealized that the company held $55 billion in \u201csuper-senior\u201d and supposedly \n\u201csuper-safe\u201d mortgage-related securities that resulted in billions of dollars in losses. \n\nWe conclude a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack \nof transparency put the financial system on a collision course with crisis. Clearly, \nthis vulnerability was related to failures of corporate governance and regulation, but \nit is significant enough by itself to warrant our attention here. \nIn the years leading up to the crisis, too many financial institutions, as well as too \nmany households, borrowed to the hilt, leaving them vulnerable to financial distress \nor ruin if the value of their investments declined even modestly. For example, as of \n2007, the five major investment banks\u2014Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman \nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley\u2014were operating with extraordinarily \nthin capital. By one measure, their leverage ratios were as high as 40 to 1, meaning for \nevery $40 in assets, there was only $1 in capital to cover losses. Less than a 3% drop in \nasset values could wipe out a firm. To make matters worse, much of their borrowing \nwas short-term, in the overnight market\u2014meaning the borrowing had to be renewed \neach and every day. For example, at the end of 2007, Bear Stearns had $11.8 billion in \nequity and $383.6 billion in liabilities and was borrowing as much as $70 billion in \nthe overnight market. It was the equivalent of a small business with $50,000 in equity \nborrowing $1.6 million, with $296,750 of that due each and every day. One can\u2019t \nreally ask \u201cWhat were they thinking?\u201d when it seems that too many of them were \nthinking alike. \n\nAnd the leverage was often hidden\u2014in derivatives positions, in off-balance-sheet \nentities, and through \u201cwindow dressing\u201d of financial reports available to the investing \npublic. \n\nThe kings of leverage were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two behemoth government-\nsponsored enterprises (GSEs). For example, by the end of 2007, Fannie\u2019s \nand Freddie\u2019s combined leverage ratio, including loans they owned and guaranteed, \nstood at 75 to 1. \n\nBut financial firms were not alone in the borrowing spree: from 2001 to 2007, national \nmortgage debt almost doubled, and the amount of mortgage debt per household \nrose more than 63% from $91,500 to $149,500, even while wages were \nessentially stagnant. When the housing downturn hit, heavily indebted financial \nfirms and families alike were walloped. \n\nThe heavy debt taken on by some financial institutions was exacerbated by the \nrisky assets they were acquiring with that debt. As the mortgage and real estate markets \nchurned out riskier and riskier loans and securities, many financial institutions \nloaded up on them. By the end of 2007, Lehman had amassed $111 billion in commercial \nand residential real estate holdings and securities, which was almost twice \nwhat it held just two years before, and more than four times its total equity. And \nagain, the risk wasn\u2019t being taken on just by the big financial firms, but by families, \ntoo. Nearly one in 10 mortgage borrowers in 2005 and 2006 took out \u201coption ARM\u201d \nloans, which meant they could choose to make payments so low that their mortgage \nbalances rose every month. \n\nWithin the financial system, the dangers of this debt were magnified because \ntransparency was not required or desired. Massive, short-term borrowing, combined \nwith obligations unseen by others in the market, heightened the chances the system \ncould rapidly unravel. In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections\u2014\nthe Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, federal deposit insurance, ample \nregulations\u2014to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued \nAmerica\u2019s banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over the past 30-plus years, we \npermitted the growth of a shadow banking system\u2014opaque and laden with short-\nterm debt\u2014that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system. Key components \nof the market\u2014for example, the multitrillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance-\nsheet entities, and the use of over-the-counter derivatives\u2014were hidden from \nview, without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns. We \nhad a 21st-century financial system with 19th-century safeguards. \n\nWhen the housing and mortgage markets cratered, the lack of transparency, the \nextraordinary debt loads, the short-term loans, and the risky assets all came home to \nroost. What resulted was panic. We had reaped what we had sown. \n\nWe conclude the government was ill prepared for the crisis, and its inconsistent \nresponse added to the uncertainty and panic in the financial markets. As part of \nour charge, it was appropriate to review government actions taken in response to the \ndeveloping crisis, not just those policies or actions that preceded it, to determine if \nany of those responses contributed to or exacerbated the crisis. \nAs our report shows, key policy makers\u2014the Treasury Department, the Federal \nReserve Board, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2014who were best positioned \nto watch over our markets were ill prepared for the events of 2007 and 2008. \nOther agencies were also behind the curve. They were hampered because they did \nnot have a clear grasp of the financial system they were charged with overseeing, particularly \nas it had evolved in the years leading up to the crisis. This was in no small \nmeasure due to the lack of transparency in key markets. They thought risk had been \ndiversified when, in fact, it had been concentrated. Time and again, from the spring \nof 2007 on, policy makers and regulators were caught off guard as the contagion \nspread, responding on an ad hoc basis with specific programs to put fingers in the \ndike. There was no comprehensive and strategic plan for containment, because they \nlacked a full understanding of the risks and interconnections in the financial markets. \nSome regulators have conceded this error. We had allowed the system to race \nahead of our ability to protect it. \n\nWhile there was some awareness of, or at least a debate about, the housing bubble, \nthe record reflects that senior public officials did not recognize that a bursting of the \nbubble could threaten the entire financial system. Throughout the summer of 2007, \nboth Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paul-\nson offered public assurances that the turmoil in the subprime mortgage markets \nwould be contained. When Bear Stearns\u2019s hedge funds, which were heavily invested \nin mortgage-related securities, imploded in June 2007, the Federal Reserve discussed \nthe implications of the collapse. Despite the fact that so many other funds were exposed \nto the same risks as those hedge funds, the Bear Stearns funds were thought to \nbe \u201crelatively unique.\u201d Days before the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008, SEC \nChairman Christopher Cox expressed \u201ccomfort about the capital cushions\u201d at the big \ninvestment banks. It was not until August 2008, just weeks before the government \ntakeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that the Treasury Department understood \nthe full measure of the dire financial conditions of those two institutions. And just a \nmonth before Lehman\u2019s collapse, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was still \nseeking information on the exposures created by Lehman\u2019s more than 900,000 derivatives \ncontracts. \n\nIn addition, the government\u2019s inconsistent handling of major financial institutions \nduring the crisis\u2014the decision to rescue Bear Stearns and then to place Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac into conservatorship, followed by its decision not to save Lehman \nBrothers and then to save AIG\u2014increased uncertainty and panic in the market. \n\nIn making these observations, we deeply respect and appreciate the efforts made \nby Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke, and Timothy Geithner, formerly president \nof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and now treasury secretary, and so \nmany others who labored to stabilize our financial system and our economy in the \nmost chaotic and challenging of circumstances. \n\nWe conclude there was a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics. The \nintegrity of our financial markets and the public\u2019s trust in those markets are essential \nto the economic well-being of our nation. The soundness and the sustained prosperity \nof the financial system and our economy rely on the notions of fair dealing, responsibility, \nand transparency. In our economy, we expect businesses and individuals \nto pursue profits, at the same time that they produce products and services of quality \nand conduct themselves well. \nUnfortunately\u2014as has been the case in past speculative booms and busts\u2014we \nwitnessed an erosion of standards of responsibility and ethics that exacerbated the financial \ncrisis. This was not universal, but these breaches stretched from the ground \nlevel to the corporate suites. They resulted not only in significant financial consequences \nbut also in damage to the trust of investors, businesses, and the public in the \nfinancial system. \n\nFor example, our examination found, according to one measure, that the percentage \nof borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages within just a matter of months \nafter taking a loan nearly doubled from the summer of 2006 to late 2007. This data \nindicates they likely took out mortgages that they never had the capacity or intention \nto pay. You will read about mortgage brokers who were paid \u201cyield spread premiums\u201d \nby lenders to put borrowers into higher-cost loans so they would get bigger fees, often \nnever disclosed to borrowers. The report catalogues the rising incidence of mortgage \nfraud, which flourished in an environment of collapsing lending standards and \nlax regulation. The number of suspicious activity reports\u2014reports of possible financial \ncrimes filed by depository banks and their affiliates\u2014related to mortgage fraud \ngrew 20-fold between 1996 and 2005 and then more than doubled again between \n2005 and 2009. One study places the losses resulting from fraud on mortgage loans \nmade between 2005 and 2007 at $112 billion. \n\nLenders made loans that they knew borrowers could not afford and that could \ncause massive losses to investors in mortgage securities. As early as September 2004, \nCountrywide executives recognized that many of the loans they were originating \ncould result in \u201ccatastrophic consequences.\u201d Less than a year later, they noted that \ncertain high-risk loans they were making could result not only in foreclosures but \nalso in \u201cfinancial and reputational catastrophe\u201d for the firm. But they did not stop. \n\nAnd the report documents that major financial institutions ineffectively sampled \nloans they were purchasing to package and sell to investors. They knew a significant \npercentage of the sampled loans did not meet their own underwriting standards or \nthose of the originators. Nonetheless, they sold those securities to investors. The \nCommission\u2019s review of many prospectuses provided to investors found that this critical \ninformation was not disclosed. \n\nTHESE CONCLUSIONS must be viewed in the context of human nature and individual \nand societal responsibility. First, to pin this crisis on mortal flaws like greed and \nhubris would be simplistic. It was the failure to account for human weakness that is \nrelevant to this crisis. \n\nSecond, we clearly believe the crisis was a result of human mistakes, misjudgments, \nand misdeeds that resulted in systemic failures for which our nation has paid \ndearly. As you read this report, you will see that specific firms and individuals acted \nirresponsibly. Yet a crisis of this magnitude cannot be the work of a few bad actors, \nand such was not the case here. At the same time, the breadth of this crisis does not \nmean that \u201ceveryone is at fault\u201d; many firms and individuals did not participate in the \nexcesses that spawned disaster. \n\nWe do place special responsibility with the public leaders charged with protecting \nour financial system, those entrusted to run our regulatory agencies, and the chief executives \nof companies whose failures drove us to crisis. These individuals sought and \naccepted positions of significant responsibility and obligation. Tone at the top does \nmatter and, in this instance, we were let down. No one said \u201cno.\u201d \n\nBut as a nation, we must also accept responsibility for what we permitted to occur. \nCollectively, but certainly not unanimously, we acquiesced to or embraced a system, \na set of policies and actions, that gave rise to our present predicament. \n\n\n\nTHIS REPORT DESCRIBES THE EVENTS and the system that propelled our nation toward \ncrisis. The complex machinery of our financial markets has many essential \ngears\u2014some of which played a critical role as the crisis developed and deepened. \nHere we render our conclusions about specific components of the system that we believe \ncontributed significantly to the financial meltdown. \n\nWe conclude collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization \npipeline lit and spread the flame of contagion and crisis. When housing \nprices fell and mortgage borrowers defaulted, the lights began to dim on Wall Street. \nThis report catalogues the corrosion of mortgage-lending standards and the securitization \npipeline that transported toxic mortgages from neighborhoods across America \nto investors around the globe. \nMany mortgage lenders set the bar so low that lenders simply took eager borrowers\u2019 \nqualifications on faith, often with a willful disregard for a borrower\u2019s ability to \npay. Nearly one-quarter of all mortgages made in the first half of 2005 were interest-\nonly loans. During the same year, 68% of \u201coption ARM\u201d loans originated by Countrywide \nand Washington Mutual had low- or no-documentation requirements. \n\nThese trends were not secret. As irresponsible lending, including predatory and \nfraudulent practices, became more prevalent, the Federal Reserve and other regulators \nand authorities heard warnings from many quarters. Yet the Federal Reserve \nneglected its mission \u201cto ensure the safety and soundness of the nation\u2019s banking and \nfinancial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers.\u201d It failed to build the \nretaining wall before it was too late. And the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \nand the Office of Thrift Supervision, caught up in turf wars, preempted state \nregulators from reining in abuses. \n\nWhile many of these mortgages were kept on banks\u2019 books, the bigger money came \nfrom global investors who clamored to put their cash into newly created mortgage-related \nsecurities. It appeared to financial institutions, investors, and regulators alike that \nrisk had been conquered: the investors held highly rated securities they thought were \nsure to perform; the banks thought they had taken the riskiest loans off their books; \nand regulators saw firms making profits and borrowing costs reduced. But each step in \nthe mortgage securitization pipeline depended on the next step to keep demand going. \nFrom the speculators who flipped houses to the mortgage brokers who scouted \nthe loans, to the lenders who issued the mortgages, to the financial firms that created \nthe mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), CDOs \nsquared, and synthetic CDOs: no one in this pipeline of toxic mortgages had enough \nskin in the game. They all believed they could off-load their risks on a moment\u2019s notice \nto the next person in line. They were wrong. When borrowers stopped making \nmortgage payments, the losses\u2014amplified by derivatives\u2014rushed through the \npipeline. As it turned out, these losses were concentrated in a set of systemically important \nfinancial institutions. \n\nIn the end, the system that created millions of mortgages so efficiently has proven \nto be difficult to unwind. Its complexity has erected barriers to modifying mortgages \nso families can stay in their homes and has created further uncertainty about the \nhealth of the housing market and financial institutions. \n\nWe conclude over-the-counter derivatives contributed significantly to this \ncrisis. The enactment of legislation in 2000 to ban the regulation by both the federal \nand state governments of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives was a key turning \npoint in the march toward the financial crisis. \nFrom financial firms to corporations, to farmers, and to investors, derivatives \nhave been used to hedge against, or speculate on, changes in prices, rates, or indices \nor even on events such as the potential defaults on debts. Yet, without any oversight, \nOTC derivatives rapidly spiraled out of control and out of sight, growing to $673 trillion \nin notional amount. This report explains the uncontrolled leverage; lack of \ntransparency, capital, and collateral requirements; speculation; interconnections \namong firms; and concentrations of risk in this market. \n\nOTC derivatives contributed to the crisis in three significant ways. First, one type \nof derivative\u2014credit default swaps (CDS)\u2014fueled the mortgage securitization \npipeline. CDS were sold to investors to protect against the default or decline in value \nof mortgage-related securities backed by risky loans. Companies sold protection\u2014to \nthe tune of $79 billion, in AIG\u2019s case\u2014to investors in these newfangled mortgage securities, \nhelping to launch and expand the market and, in turn, to further fuel the \nhousing bubble. \n\nSecond, CDS were essential to the creation of synthetic CDOs. These synthetic \nCDOs were merely bets on the performance of real mortgage-related securities. They \namplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets \non the same securities and helped spread them throughout the financial system. \nGoldman Sachs alone packaged and sold $73 billion in synthetic CDOs from July 1, \n2004, to May 31, 2007. Synthetic CDOs created by Goldman referenced more than \n3,400 mortgage securities, and 610 of them were referenced at least twice. This is \napart from how many times these securities may have been referenced in synthetic \nCDOs created by other firms. \n\nFinally, when the housing bubble popped and crisis followed, derivatives were in \nthe center of the storm. AIG, which had not been required to put aside capital reserves \nas a cushion for the protection it was selling, was bailed out when it could not \nmeet its obligations. The government ultimately committed more than $180 billion \nbecause of concerns that AIG\u2019s collapse would trigger cascading losses throughout \nthe global financial system. In addition, the existence of millions of derivatives contracts \nof all types between systemically important financial institutions\u2014unseen and \nunknown in this unregulated market\u2014added to uncertainty and escalated panic, \nhelping to precipitate government assistance to those institutions. \n\nWe conclude the failures of credit rating agencies were essential cogs in the \nwheel of financial destruction. The three credit rating agencies were key enablers of \nthe financial meltdown. The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis \ncould not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied \non them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory \ncapital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened \nwithout the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades \nthrough 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms. \nIn our report, you will read about the breakdowns at Moody\u2019s, examined by the \nCommission as a case study. From 2000 to 2007, Moody\u2019s rated nearly 45,000 \nmortgage-related securities as triple-A. This compares with six private-sector companies \nin the United States that carried this coveted rating in early 2010. In 2006 \nalone, Moody\u2019s put its triple-A stamp of approval on 30 mortgage-related securities \nevery working day. The results were disastrous: 83% of the mortgage securities rated \ntriple-A that year ultimately were downgraded. \n\nYou will also read about the forces at work behind the breakdowns at Moody\u2019s, including \nthe flawed computer models, the pressure from financial firms that paid for \nthe ratings, the relentless drive for market share, the lack of resources to do the job \ndespite record profits, and the absence of meaningful public oversight. And you will \nsee that without the active participation of the rating agencies, the market for mortgage-\nrelated securities could not have been what it became. \n\n\n\nTHERE ARE MANY COMPETING VIEWS as to the causes of this crisis. In this regard, the \nCommission has endeavored to address key questions posed to us. Here we discuss \nthree: capital availability and excess liquidity, the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n(the GSEs), and government housing policy. \n\nFirst, as to the matter of excess liquidity: in our report, we outline monetary policies \nand capital flows during the years leading up to the crisis. Low interest rates, \nwidely available capital, and international investors seeking to put their money in real \nestate assets in the United States were prerequisites for the creation of a credit bubble. \nThose conditions created increased risks, which should have been recognized by \nmarket participants, policy makers, and regulators. However, it is the Commission\u2019s \nconclusion that excess liquidity did not need to cause a crisis. It was the failures outlined \nabove\u2014including the failure to effectively rein in excesses in the mortgage and \nfinancial markets\u2014that were the principal causes of this crisis. Indeed, the availability \nof well-priced capital\u2014both foreign and domestic\u2014is an opportunity for economic \nexpansion and growth if encouraged to flow in productive directions. \n\nSecond, we examined the role of the GSEs, with Fannie Mae serving as the Commission\u2019s \ncase study in this area. These government-sponsored enterprises had a \ndeeply flawed business model as publicly traded corporations with the implicit backing \nof and subsidies from the federal government and with a public mission. Their \n$5 trillion mortgage exposure and market position were significant. In 2005 and \n2006, they decided to ramp up their purchase and guarantee of risky mortgages, just \nas the housing market was peaking. They used their political power for decades to \nward off effective regulation and oversight\u2014spending $164 million on lobbying from \n1998 to 2008. They suffered from many of the same failures of corporate governance \nand risk management as the Commission discovered in other financial firms. \nThrough the third quarter of 2010, the Treasury Department had provided $151 billion \nin financial support to keep them afloat. \n\nWe conclude that these two entities contributed to the crisis, but were not a primary \ncause. Importantly, GSE mortgage securities essentially maintained their value \nthroughout the crisis and did not contribute to the significant financial firm losses \nthat were central to the financial crisis. \n\nThe GSEs participated in the expansion of subprime and other risky mortgages, \nbut they followed rather than led Wall Street and other lenders in the rush for fool\u2019s \ngold. They purchased the highest rated non-GSE mortgage-backed securities and \ntheir participation in this market added helium to the housing balloon, but their purchases \nnever represented a majority of the market. Those purchases represented 10.5% \nof non-GSE subprime mortgage-backed securities in 2001, with the share rising to \n40% in 2004, and falling back to 28% by 2008. They relaxed their underwriting standards \nto purchase or guarantee riskier loans and related securities in order to meet \nstock market analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations for growth, to regain market share, \nand to ensure generous compensation for their executives and employees\u2014justifying \ntheir activities on the broad and sustained public policy support for homeownership. \n\nThe Commission also probed the performance of the loans purchased or guaranteed \nby Fannie and Freddie. While they generated substantial losses, delinquency \nrates for GSE loans were substantially lower than loans securitized by other financial \nfirms. For example, data compiled by the Commission for a subset of borrowers with \nsimilar credit scores--scores below 600--show that by the end of 2008, GSE mortgages \nwere far less likely to be seriously delinquent than were non-GSE securitized \nmortgages: 6.2% versus 28.3%. \n\nWe also studied at length how the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s \n(HUD\u2019s) affordable housing goals for the GSEs affected their investment in \nrisky mortgages. Based on the evidence and interviews with dozens of individuals involved \nin this subject area, we determined these goals only contributed marginally to \nFannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s participation in those mortgages. \n\nFinally, as to the matter of whether government housing policies were a primary \ncause of the crisis: for decades, government policy has encouraged homeownership \nthrough a set of incentives, assistance programs, and mandates. These policies were \nput in place and promoted by several administrations and Congresses\u2014indeed, both \nPresidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush set aggressive goals to increase home-\nownership. \n\nIn conducting our inquiry, we took a careful look at HUD\u2019s affordable housing \ngoals, as noted above, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA was \nenacted in 1977 to combat \u201credlining\u201d by banks\u2014the practice of denying credit to individuals \nand businesses in certain neighborhoods without regard to their creditworthiness. \nThe CRA requires banks and savings and loans to lend, invest, and provide \nservices to the communities from which they take deposits, consistent with bank \nsafety and soundness. \n\nThe Commission concludes the CRA was not a significant factor in subprime lending \nor the crisis. Many subprime lenders were not subject to the CRA. Research indicates\nonly 6% of high-cost loans\u2014a proxy for subprime loans\u2014had any connection to \nthe law. Loans made by CRA-regulated lenders in the neighborhoods in which they \nwere required to lend were half as likely to default as similar loans made in the same \nneighborhoods by independent mortgage originators not subject to the law. \n\nNonetheless, we make the following observation about government housing policies\u2014\nthey failed in this respect: As a nation, we set aggressive homeownership goals \nwith the desire to extend credit to families previously denied access to the financial \nmarkets. Yet the government failed to ensure that the philosophy of opportunity was \nbeing matched by the practical realities on the ground. Witness again the failure of \nthe Federal Reserve and other regulators to rein in irresponsible lending. Homeownership \npeaked in the spring of 2004 and then began to decline. From that point on, \nthe talk of opportunity was tragically at odds with the reality of a financial disaster in \nthe making. \n\n\n\nWHEN THIS COMMISSION began its work 18 months ago, some imagined that the \nevents of 2008 and their consequences would be well behind us by the time we issued \nthis report. Yet more than two years after the federal government intervened in an \nunprecedented manner in our financial markets, our country finds itself still grappling \nwith the aftereffects of the calamity. Our financial system is, in many respects, \nstill unchanged from what existed on the eve of the crisis. Indeed, in the wake of the \ncrisis, the U.S. financial sector is now more concentrated than ever in the hands of a \nfew large, systemically significant institutions. \n\nWhile we have not been charged with making policy recommendations, the very \npurpose of our report has been to take stock of what happened so we can plot a new \ncourse. In our inquiry, we found dramatic breakdowns of corporate governance, \nprofound lapses in regulatory oversight, and near fatal flaws in our financial system. \nWe also found that a series of choices and actions led us toward a catastrophe for \nwhich we were ill prepared. These are serious matters that must be addressed and \nresolved to restore faith in our financial markets, to avoid the next crisis, and to rebuild \na system of capital that provides the foundation for a new era of broadly \nshared prosperity. \n\nThe greatest tragedy would be to accept the refrain that no one could have seen \nthis coming and thus nothing could have been done. If we accept this notion, it will \nhappen again. \n\nThis report should not be viewed as the end of the nation\u2019s examination of this \ncrisis. There is still much to learn, much to investigate, and much to fix. \n\nThis is our collective responsibility. It falls to us to make different choices if we \nwant different results. \n\n \n", "mode": "written", "name": "fcic_final_report_conclusions", "class": "govt-docs"}

LSC management prides itself on thorough and\neffective monitoring of recipient activities and on its training of\nrecipients with regard to compliance issues.\nOf particular importance, however, are the methods for ensuring\nthat LSC obtain necessary access to information in ways that ensure\nfull compliance consistent with its statutory obligations. Congress\nhas mandated that LSC effectively monitor and audit its grant\nrecipients, and that LSC respect attorney-client privilege and\nensure that LSC recipients carry out their work consistent with\ntheir professional responsibilities.\nPlease note that the statement of practices appended hereto as\n\"Access to Records\" does not and is not intended to waive or alter\nany of LSC's rights to documents and other information and does not\napply to audits, investigations and other OIG activities.\nThe Protocol is intended to set forth LSC's policy with respect\nto accessing grant recipients' files and to facilitate better\ncommunication and understanding on this topic. With appropriate\nnotice to the Board and LSC grant recipients, LSC's President may\nchange or alter this Protocol as circumstances warrant.\nACCESS TO RECORDS\n\nApril 25, 2002\nThis document sets forth procedures to be used by LSC's Office\nof Compliance and Enforcement (OCE) and Office of Program\nPerformance (OPP) when making requests to review documents that\ncontain information about clients and their cases that may be\nprotected from disclosure to LSC by the attorney-client privilege\nor the rules of professional responsibility.\n\nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK\nLSC has the statutory responsibility to ensure that recipients\ncomply with the provisions of the LSC Act and regulations and any\nother laws, including appropriation provisions, which apply to LSC\nfunds or recipients. See Section 1006(b)(1)(A). LSC is given\nexplicit authority \"to prescribe the keeping of records with\nrespect to funds provided by grant or contract and shall have\naccess to such records at all reasonable times for the purpose of\ninsuring compliance with the grant or contract or the terms and\nconditions upon which financial assistance was provided.\" See\nSection 1008 (b).\nHowever, the LSC Act recognizes that some records contain\ninformation that is protected by the attorney-client privilege\nand/or attorney's ethical responsibilities under rules of\nprofessional responsibility. Section 1009(d) of the LSC Act\nexplicitly provides that \"neither the Corporation nor the\nComptroller General shall have access to any reports or records\nsubject to the attorneyclient privilege.\" In addition, section\n1006(b)(3) includes both a prohibition that LSC \"shall not, under\nany provision of this title, interfere with any attorney in\ncarrying out his professional responsibilities\" and also imposes an\naffirmative duty that LSC \"shall ensure that activities under this\ntitle are carried out in a manner consistent with attorneys'\nprofessional responsibilities.\"\nSection 509(h) of the 1996 LSC appropriation, which has been\nreenacted in each subsequent year, provides that, notwithstanding\nsection 1006(b)(3), LSC auditors and monitors are given explicit\naccess to \"financial records, time records, retainer agreements,\nclient trust fund and eligibility records, and client names, for\neach recipient \u2026 except for reports or records subject to the\nattorney-client privilege.\" See United States v. Legal Services of\nNew York City, 249 F.3d 1077 (D.C. Cir. 2001). In addition, section\n504(a)(8) of the 1996 LSC appropriation authorizes LSC access to\nthe client \"statement of facts.\" Disclosure of information not\nrequired by these sections of the 1996 appropriation provisions is\ngoverned by sections 1006(b)(3) and 1009(d) of the LSC Act.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this document is to inform LSC recipients and\nother interested parties of the procedure for providing LSC access\nto records in a manner consistent with the attorney-client\nprivilege and applicable rules of professional responsibility and\nthe mechanism to resolve issues of how such access can be\nobtained.\n\n\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\nLSC will act to carry out its statutory responsibilities to\nensure compliance with the LSC Act, appropriation provisions and\nany other provisions of law and will do so consistent with the\nstatutory provisions on both privileged and confidential\ninformation.\nLSC recipients are obligated to provide information to LSC under\nthe applicable LSC statutes, regulations, grant terms, grant\nassurances, and other rules and provisions regarding the receipt\nand use of LSC funds. For example, upon request, recipients must\nprovide LSC access to all records specified in section 509(h)\nunless, as provided in section 509(h), the information sought is\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege. In addition, upon\nrequest, recipients must also provide LSC access to original\nunredacted client \"statement of facts,\" as required by 45 CFR\n\u00a71636. Recipients and LSC will work together in good faith\nregarding issues of access to records that may contain information\nprotected by rules of professional responsibility or the law on\nattorney-client privilege.\n\n\nPROCEDURES\n\n\n1.\nApplicability: This procedure applies to requests by the\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement (OCE) or the Office of Program\nPerformance (OPP) for access to records of a recipient that may\ninclude information that may be protected by rules of professional\nresponsibility or the law on attorney-client privilege. Such\ninformation will hereafter be referred to as privileged or\nconfidential information. As applied to OPP, references to OCE and\nthe Vice President for Administration shall be to OPP and the Vice\nPresident for Programs.\n\n\n2.\nNotice to the Recipient: Whenever OCE proposes to review\nthe records of a recipient either through an on-site visit or\notherwise, OCE notifies the recipient orally and in writing about\nthe purpose of the visit or review, what activities OCE will\nconduct, and what specific information and records are planned to\nbe within the scope of the review. Each review is an ongoing\nprocess that may expand based on information reviewed. As such, OCE\nwill notify the recipient orally and in writing when the scope of\nthe review has changed or expanded and what information and records\nare further required.\n\n\n3.\nUse of Intermediaries: In all written and oral\ncommunications with recipients, OCE will affirmatively propose that\nrecipients use program staff as an intermediary to review case\nfiles (or other records containing privileged or confidential\ninformation) and to answer questions of OCE. During on-site visits,\nOCE will affirmatively encourage recipients to use such\nintermediaries and will not request direct access to or control\nover client case files or any other records containing privileged\nor confidential information.\n\n\n4.\nFlexibility of Approaches: OCE shall consider and seek to\naccommodate reasonable approaches to access to records proposed by\nrecipients to protect privileged or confidential information so\nlong as such proposed approaches also ensure access by OCE to\ninformation it needs to carry out its responsibilities. Such\nreasonable approaches may include unique client identifiers when\nappropriate.\n\n\n5.\nUnique State Ethics Rules: LSC acknowledges that there\nmay be states where the rules of professional responsibility,\nethics rulings, case law or other laws differ from the general\nframework under the Model Rules of Professional Responsibility and\nwhere the disclosures sought by OCE may implicate the recipient\nattorneys' professional responsibilities or other law. Recipients\nhave the responsibility to bring such ethical rulings to the\nattention of OCE as set forth in section 7 below after they have\nbeen notified by OCE of an impending request for access to records\ncontaining privileged or confidential information\n\n\n6.\nQuestions of Attorney-Client Privilege: OCE shall not\nhave access to information protected by the attorney-client\nprivilege, including information covered by section 509(h). A\nrecipient shall notify OCE under the procedures set forth in\nsection 7 below, that the information sought is, in the recipient's\nview, protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n7.\nProcedures for Addressing Privileged or Confidential\nInformation: If a recipient believes that documents or information\nrequested by OCE contain information that is protected by the\nattorney-client privilege, applicable rules of professional\nresponsibility or other law, the recipient will send written notice\nto OCE as soon as possible setting forth (1) a full description of\nthe nature of the privileged or confidential information, (2) a\nstatement explaining the basis for determining that such\ninformation is privileged or confidential, and (3) any\nrecommendations of reasonable approaches to accessing such\ninformation. Upon receipt of this notice, OCE will so notify the\nVice President for Administration and seek to find a mutually\nsatisfactory manner for obtaining access to the information\nconsistent with the applicable rules of attorney-client privilege\nand professional responsibility and consistent with LSC's need for\ninformation to ensure compliance.\n\n\nIf OCE is not able to expediently resolve all outstanding issues\nof concern, it will, through the Vice President for Administration,\npromptly so advise LSC's President and the Vice Presidents for\nPrograms, Legal Affairs and Government Relations of the access\nissues raised and the specific reasons why the proposed alternative\nmethods of access are inadequate. The Vice President for\nAdministration and Programs, with advice of the Office of Legal\nAffairs, then will review the concerns raised by the recipient. If\nthe Vice Presidents for Administration and Programs do not agree\nwith the position of the recipient, then LSC will so notify the\nrecipient in writing and OCE will proceed with the review.\nIf Vice Presidents for Administration and Programs agree that\nthe recipient has a reasonable claim that the information is\nprivileged or confidential, then OCE will further seek to develop a\nmutually satisfactory manner for obtaining access to the\ninformation consistent with the applicable rules of attorney-client\nprivilege and professional responsibility and consistent with LSC's\nneed for information to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\n8.\nDisputes Between LSC and Recipients: If OCE and the\nrecipient cannot agree on an approach that will give OCE\nappropriate access to the records it needs and is consistent with\nthe recipient's responsibilities to protect privileged or\nconfidential information, OCE, through the Vice-President for\nAdministration, may recommend to the Vice President for Programs\nthat LSC should take appropriate action with respect to the\nrecipient. The Vice President for Programs will review the\nrecommendation and make further inquiry as appropriate. The Vice\nPresident for Programs may request that and the President may\ndirect OCE to further work with the recipient on an acceptable\nresolution or appropriately modify the request.\n\nIf the Vice President for Programs determines that LSC should\nproceed to take action affecting the recipient, it shall notify the\nrecipient in writing of the action that is proposed. If the action\ninvolves suspension or termination of funding, LSC will proceed in\na manner consistent with Parts 1606 or 1623 of Title 45 of the Code\nof Federal Regulations. However, if the action involves a sanction\nor adverse action other than termination or suspension, then LSC\nmay, and is encouraged to, allow a recipient an opportunity to\nfurther present it's position. Such a process could follow the\nfollowing procedure. The recipient would be given an opportunity to\nrequest a meeting with the Vice President for Programs to ask for\nreconsideration of the proposed action. If the recipient requests\nsuch a face-to-face meeting, the Vice President for Programs would\nconvene such a meeting and make a recommendation to LSC's President\nas to how LSC should proceed. As soon thereafter as is practical,\nthe Vice President for Programs would notify the recipient in\nwriting of the recommendation to the President and the reasons\ntherefore. The recipient may then request a meeting with the LSC\nPresident to ask for reconsideration of the Vice President's\nrecommendation. The recipient would be given the opportunity to\nprovide such additional written information as it believes will\nassist the President to fully and fairly consider its concerns and\nobjections. Upon such request, the President could also convene a\nface-to-face meeting with the authorized representatives of the\nrecipient. As soon thereafter as practical, the LSC President would\nadvise the recipient of the final decision and reasons therefore.\nThe decision of the LSC President would be in writing and shall be\nfinal and binding.\n\n\n9.\nIf LSC management determines that a recipient has taken\nan unreasonable position or refused to work in good faith with OCE\non these issues, then LSC may take reasonable corrective action in\naddition to pursuing access to the information in\nquestion.\n\n\n10.\nIn describing these procedures, LSC does not in any way\nwaive the statutory rights and obligations of LSC or LSC recipients\nregarding access to and review of LSC recipients' records and\ninformation. These procedures do not create new rights or\nobligations for LSC or LSC recipients and may be modified by the\nLSC President as warranted, with appropriate notice to the Board\nand field programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "LSC-Protocol_Regarding_Access", "class": "govt-docs"}

SUMMARY\nThis report provides an analysis of the United States Postal\nService's current legal authority to: (1) introduce and provide new\nproducts and services; and (2) enter into negotiated service\nagreements with individual customers. This report also includes\nbackground on the use of such authority within the past two\nyears.\nThe Commission's analysis of existing postal law yields the\nfollowing conclusions:\n\n\n\u2022\nThe Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gives the United\nStates Postal Service a clear mandate to innovate by developing\neffective and efficient services adapted to the needs of the\nNation's mail users.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic\nmail services is the joint authority shared by the Postal Service\nand the Postal Rate Commission to adopt new mail classifications\nunder 39 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3623 through 3625.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe Postal Rate Commission has developed specialized\nprocedural rules that provide for expeditious consideration of\nproposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due\nprocess rights of other interested persons.\n\n\n\u2022\nNegotiated Service Agreements (NSAs) or \"niche\nclassifications\" are rate and service adjustments arranged by the\nPostal Service and potential users that are legally permissible,\nprovided that:\n\n\n\u2776 The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding, as the\nReorganization Act requires;\n\u2777 The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the\nmutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole;\nand\n\u2778 The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on\nthe same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same\nconditions of service.\n\n\nII. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF ANALYSIS\nIn joint deliberations on appropriations for the United States\nPostal Service and certain other agencies and departments for\nFiscal Year 2002, the committee of conference directed both the\nPostal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to prepare reports on\nparticular areas of the Postal Service's authority under existing\nlaw.1 Specifically, the conferees directed:\n\u2026both the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate\nCommission to independently report, 90 days after enactment of this\nAct, on the scope of existing authority of the US Postal Service,\nunder title 39, United States Code, and title 39, Code of Federal\nRegulations, to introduce and provide new products and services\n(including the introduction and provision of new products and\nservice on an experimental or market test basis) and to enter into\nnegotiated service agreements with individual customers or groups\nof customers. Such reports shall include background on the use of\nsuch authority within the past 24 months and shall be provided to\nthe Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on\nGovernmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government\nReform.\nH. R. CONF. REP. NO. 107-253, 107th Cong., 1st Sess. 59 (2001).\nAs directed, the Commission submits this report to the Senate and\nHouse of Representatives Committees on Appropriations, the Senate\nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on\nGovernment Reform.\nThe report is presented in three sections. The first outlines\nthe Postal Service's current legal authority to introduce new\nproducts and services, the role of the Postal Rate Commission in\nthat process, and the procedural mechanisms available for expedited\napproval of such innovations. The second section addresses the same\ntopics in connection with Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs),\nso-called \"niche classifications,\" which are special service and\nrate arrangements negotiated between the Postal Service and a\nparticular mailer or groups of mailers with features tailored to\ntheir use of the postal system. Finally, an appendix to the report\nsummarizes recent\n1 The amended bill produced by the conference committee was\nenacted as Pub. L. No. 107-67, 115 Stat. 514 (2001).\nCommission proceedings in which the Postal Service has sought to\nintroduce service innovations-some of them customized for\nparticular groups of mailers-on an expedited basis.\nIII. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP, INTRODUCE AND PROVIDE\nNEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\n\nA. Innovation under the Postal Reorganization Act\nWhile pre-existing law afforded limited opportunities for postal\ninnovation,2 the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gave the\nnewly-created United States Postal Service a clear mandate to\ninnovate by developing effective and efficient services adapted to\nthe needs of the Nation's mail users. Section 101(a) of Title 39\nestablishes the Postal Service's paramount obligation \"to provide\npostal services to bind the Nation together through the personal,\neducational, literary, and business correspondence of the people.\"\nThe same section establishes the performance criterion that the\nPostal Service is expected to achieve as a matter of postal policy:\n\"It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to\npatrons in all areas and . . . all communities.\" Similarly, \u00a7\n403(a) assigns the Postal Service the duty to \"plan, develop,\npromote, and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fair\nand reasonable rates and fees.\" The Act fosters service innovation\nby assigning the Postal Service responsibility \"to provide types of\nmail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and\nmail users[.]\" 39\nU.S.C. \u00a7 403(b)(2).\nThe Reorganization Act grants the Postal Service specific powers\nthat serve as the operational tools of service innovation. Section\n404 of Title 39 grants the Postal Service plenary authority over\ncustody of the mail and its movement [\u00a7 404(a)(1)]; over the\ndeployment of post offices, other facilities, and equipment [\u00a7\n404(a)(3)]; and over the means by which stamps and other postage\nare sold [\u00a7 404(a)(4) and (5)]. The same section also authorizes\nthe Postal Service \"to provide, establish, change, or abolish\nspecial nonpostal or similar services[.]\" 39 U.S.C. \u00a7\n404(a)(6).\nConclusion: The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 clearly\nmandates that the Postal Service innovate by developing effective\nand efficient postal services adapted to the needs of the Nation's\nmail users.\n2 Former 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a) authorized the Postmaster General to\nmaintain a research and development program, and to conduct\nexperiments to enhance the operational efficiency and economy of\nthe postal system.\n\n\nB. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail\nClassifications\nPrior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post\nOffice Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The\nReorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal\nservices with an administrative process in which the Governors of\nthe Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission\nreviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal\nservices, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification\nSchedule (or \"DMCS\").4\nSection 3621 of Title 39 provides that \"the Governors are\nauthorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail .\n. . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\" Section\n3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the\nPostal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a\nmail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization\nAct's effective date. The Postal Service complied with this\nrequirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification\nSchedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6,\n1976.5\nFollowing establishment of this initial mail classification\nschedule, \u00a7 3623(b) provides that the Postal Service \"may from time\nto time request that the Commission submit, or the Commission may\nsubmit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended\ndecision on changes in the mail classification schedule.\"\nDeliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow\nproceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is\nafforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to\nrepresent the interests of the general public. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(a).\nThe Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the\nmail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39\nof the Code of Federal Regulations, 39\nC.F.R. \u00a7 3001.61 et seq.\n3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter.\n4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is\npublished as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001,\nfollowing 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 3001.68\n5 Docket No. MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision,\nApril 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United\nStates Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification\nSchedule, June 2, 1976.\nOver the past 25 years, the Postal Service has filed many such\nmail classification requests with the Commission, seeking either to\nestablish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing\nservices. Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on\nits own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's\nrequest to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer\nuseful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal\nservices.\nConclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and\nthe Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt\nnew mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing\ninnovations in domestic mail service.\nC. Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious\nConsideration of Proposed Service Innovations\nRecognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations\nmerit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission\nhas adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined\ncategories of Postal Service requests. The rules depart from those\ngenerally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by\nreducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is\nrequired to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural\nschedule for considering the particular form of proposed\nchange.\nThe Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was\na need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail\nclassification requests involving proposed new services, or changes\nin existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments.\nThe rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3001.67 through .67d, provide\na mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing\nis required; allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability\nof data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data\ncollection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental\nrules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the\nCommission's determination that the proposed change is experimental\nin nature.\nThese rules were not used extensively. A joint Postal\nService-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of\nareas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal\nService innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission\nin 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's\nrecommendations. The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider\nthe rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering\nthe comments of interested parties, implemented four of the\nproposed initiatives, albeit in revised form.\nThree of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures\nfor particular categories of Postal Service requests. The fourth\nset specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi-year\ntest periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become\ncompensatory over time.\nThe first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into\nthe Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7\nestablish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service\nproposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify\nthe limited information the Service is required to file in support\nof a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the\nproposed new service and associated data collection and reporting\nrequirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing\nprocedures, and provide for issuance of a \"yes or no\" Commission\ndecision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent\nwith the procedural due process rights of interested persons. The\nPostal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a\nthree-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket\nNo. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the\nCommission under the market test rules. See the Appendix to this\nreport under the heading for Docket No. MC2000-2.\nThe second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to\nimplement new services that would supplement, but not alter,\nexisting mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for\na limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional\nservice rules identify the supporting information to be provided by\nthe Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain\nwhy it should not be required to provide\n6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the\nJoint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992.\n7 39 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3001.161-.166.\n8 39 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3001.171-.176.\ninformation called for in the Commission's general rules for\nmail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public\nnotice and procedural scheduling, providing for a \"yes or no\"\nCommission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process\nrights of other parties.\nA third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the\nrules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for\npermanent mail classification changes that are minor in character.\n\"Minor\" classification changes are defined as those that would not\nchange any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new\nrestriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly\nincrease or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected\nmail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the\nPostal Service. The rules specify limited required supporting\ninformation, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of\notherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling.\nUnder these rules for minor classification proposals, the\nprocedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days\nfrom the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are\nheld, and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case.\nFinally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and\n182 of the rules of practice, 10 applies to Postal Service requests\nfor new services that it believes cannot recover all their\nassociated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation.\nIn such instances, the Service's request must be supported by\ntestimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale\nfor the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also\nprovide Return on Investment projections, other available financial\nanalyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new\nservice for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a\npolicy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years\nfor the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced\npostal services.\nThe Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be\neffective for a period of five years. In light of their apparent\nworkability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing\nusefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the\n9 39 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3001.69-69c. 10 39 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3001.181-.182.\nPostal Service, the Commission extended their application for an\nadditional five-year period in a recent rulemaking.11\nConclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of\nprocedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to\nprovide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations\nin a manner consistent with the due process rights of all\ninterested persons.\n11 Docket No. RM2001-3, Order No. 1322, 66 Fed. Reg. 54436\n(2001).\nIV. POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND\nSERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS\nTO PROVIDE SERVICES\nFor a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of\nestablishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service\nthrough negotiation with the Postal Service. Depending on their\nrespective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of\nthis kind have been labeled \"contract rates,\" \"negotiated service\nagreements,\" or more recently, \"niche classifications.\" In\naddressing the consistency of these various approaches with current\nlaw, it is important to identify and consider all of their\ncharacteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be\ndependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed\nwithout any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form\nof review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its\neffectiveness.\nA. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority\nNo provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits\nthe Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements\nwith mail users. Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the\nService \"to enter into and perform contracts,\" and there is no\nprohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users\nnegotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of\nservice should be changed. However, other provisions in Title 39\ncast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under \u00a7\n401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail\nclassifications by agreement alone.\nThe obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and\nsubstantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of\nrate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful\nbecause the only means of making such changes recognized in the\nReorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of\nTitle 39. These provisions require that rate or mail classification\nchanges desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request\nwith the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and\ndeliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal\nService.\nFailure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36\nhas been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the\nintended change.12\nNegotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the\nsubstantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications\nin the Reorganization Act. Section 403(c) of Title 39 directs\nthat:\nIn providing services and in establishing classifications,\nrates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not,\nexcept as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or\nunreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it\ngrant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user.\nSections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity,\ntogether with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in\nmaking rate and mail classification changes. Without public\nscrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service\nagreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be\nno assurance that these substantive criteria would be\nsatisfied.\nHowever, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are\nmet, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for\ntheir mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable\nstatutory standards. Section 3623(c) directs the Commission to\nconsider \"the desirability and justification for special\nclassifications and services of mail\" [\u00a7 3623(c)(2)] and \"the\ndesirability of special classifications from the point of view of\nboth the user and of the Postal Service\" [\u00a7 3623(c)(5)]. Regarding\nrates, \u00a7 3622(b)(6) establishes \"the degree of preparation of mail\nfor delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its\neffect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service\" as a factor to be\nconsidered in connection with a proposed change. In combination\nwith other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act,\nthese\n12 United Parcel Service v. U. S. Postal Service, 455 F.Supp.\n857 (E.D. Pa. 1978), affirmed, 604 F.2d 1370 (3d Cir. 1979), cert.\ndenied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980).\nconsiderations could support recommendation of rate and\nclassification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of\nparticular mailers.\nConclusion: Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal\nService and mail users are permissible under current law if the\nprocedural and substantive requirements of the Postal\nReorganization Act are satisfied.\n\n\nB. Problematical \"Contract Rates\"\nIn a rulemaking proceeding conducted in the late 1980s at the\nrequest of a mailer, the Commission addressed the question of the\nPostal Service's authority to negotiate rate changes in the form of\na proposal to recognize \"contract rates.\" After considering\ncomments of the Postal Service and other participants, the\nCommission found the proposal problematical, and declined to pursue\nit.\nThe initial proposal, considered in Docket No. RM89-5, included\ntwo variants:\n\n\n1.\nThe Commission might, after considering cost and other\nrelevant evidence, establish a range of permissible rates for\nparticular subclasses, with the Postal Service and individual\nmailers free thereafter to negotiate rates within this range;\nor\n\n\n2.\nThe Postal Service and one or more mailers would\nnegotiate a rate and service package which would then (i) be\nsubmitted to the Commission for a review, and (ii) thereafter be\navailable on the same terms to all potential users.\n\n\nThe Commission solicited two rounds of comments on the proposal\nfrom interested parties. The proponent and one other mailer took\nthe position that the Postal Service is authorized to enter into\nsuch contracts, provided the procedural requirement of review under\nChapter 36 is observed. Other commenters-including the Commission's\nOffice of Consumer Advocate-expressed doubts regarding the legal\nsoundness of one or both of the proposed variants of such\nagreements. The Postal Service commented that, in its view, legal\nconstraints would not preclude a contract mechanism in principle,\nbut that no such arrangement would be permissible without the\nCommission's participation in accordance with 39 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3622\nthrough 3625.\nUpon consideration of the initial comments it received, the\nCommission declined to pursue the contract rate proposal, but\nsolicited further comments on several broad issues concerning\npossible changes in the mail classification system. The Commission\nexplained that its reluctance to pursue the concept of contract\nrates was based on substantial uncertainty regarding the legal\nsufficiency of examining agreed-upon rates after the fact, rather\nthan in a prior review. It also raised the potential problems of\nunreasonable discrimination that such contracts might cause, in\ncontravention of 39\nU.S.C. \u00a7 403(c), and the preservation of fair contributions to\nthe Postal Service's institutional costs by mail volumes.13 Such\nproblems might well arise if the Service were to negotiate\n\"discounted\" rates-unaccompanied by a change in service conditions\nthat provided cost or revenue justification.\nConclusion: Negotiated rates-unaccompanied by a change in\nservice conditions that provides cost justification-are a\nproblematical approach to introducing additional flexibility into\nPostal Service business practices.\n\n\nC. Negotiated Service Agreements and Specialized \"Niche\nClassifications\"\nFollowing publication of the report of the joint Postal\nService-Postal Rate Commission task force on ratemaking, the Postal\nService petitioned the Commission to adopt rules to implement some\nof the report's recommendations. One recommendation included in the\nService's petition was adoption of Commission rules for reviewing\non an expedited basis \"service agreements with postal customers,\nvarying from the general rate and classifications schedules in ways\nwhich add value both for the customer and for the postal system as\na whole.\"14\nThe proposal in the Postal Service's petition would have\nestablished Negotiated Service Agreements as a new form of mail\nclassification, with individual agreements to be reviewed by the\nCommission within 60 days. In the Commission's Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking, it deferred consideration of the NSA proposal, citing\nlegal uncertainty regarding the consistency of negotiated rates\nwith the Reorganization Act's\n13 Docket No. RM89-5, Further Invitation for Comments, 54 Fed.\nReg. 47223 (1989). 14 Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change, supra,\nat 54.\nratemaking provisions. However, the Commission also expressed a\ngeneral willingness to address the concept in a subsequent\nrulemaking.\nSince then, the Commission has conducted several mail\nclassification proceedings under the other expedited procedures\nadopted in that rulemaking. These procedures have been shown to be\nwell suited to the consideration of \"niche classification\"\nproposals. Niche classifications are specialized mail\nclassifications- including reduced, but cost-justified rates or\nfees-that have been developed by the Postal Service in direct\nconsultation with its customers, to meet the needs and capabilities\nof a mailer or group of mailers. For example, the Commission\napproved a two-year experiment of a program that enabled users of\nbulk, nonletter-size Business Reply Mail such as photofinishers\nthat could reliably determine postage and fees due, to obtain\nearlier access to their mail at revised fees.15 The Commission\nsubsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment,16 and\nultimately approved a request to make the experimental program a\npermanent mail classification.17 More recently, in Docket No.\nMC2001-1, the Commission recommended three new worksharing-based\ndiscounted Priority Mail categories after negotiating with mailers\nwho were willing to presort their mail in new ways that could\nreduce the Postal Service's costs.18 Such \"niche classification\"\nproposals are essentially Negotiated Service Agreements, without\nany associated legal uncertainties or additional administrative\nbarriers.\nConclusion: Rate and service adjustments agreed upon by the\nPostal Service and mailers are legally authorized if three\nconditions are satisfied:\n\u2776 The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding, as the\nReorganization Act requires;\n\u2777 The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the\nmutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole;\nand\n15 Docket No. MC97-1, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 2,\n1997.\n16 Docket No. MC99-1, Opinion and Recommended Decision Approving\nRevised Stipulation and Agreement, May 14, 1998.\n17 Docket No. MC99-2, Opinion and Recommended Decision Approving\nStipulation and Agreement, July 14, 1999.\n18 See the description of this proceeding in the Appendix.\n\u2778 The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on\nthe same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same\nconditions of service.\nExamples of \"niche classification\" proposals recommended in\nrecent Commission proceedings, and Postal Service product\ninnovations considered in other cases, are described in the\nAppendix to this report.\nReport To The Congress Appendix Feb. 11, 2002 Page 1 of 2\nPostal Service Product Innovations and Special-Purpose Mail\nClassification Changes Reviewed by the Postal Rate Commission Since\nJanuary 1, 2000\n\n\nDocket No. MC2001-1-Experimental Presorted Priority Mail Rate\nCategories\n\n\n\u2022\nNature of service or change: Experimental trial of three\nnew presorted rate categories of Priority Mail.\n\n\n\u2022\nTarget users: Mailers who can meet minimum quantity, mail\npreparation and containerization requirements for presorting their\nPriority Mail shipments.\n\n\n\u2022\nRate(s) and justification: Three levels of presort\ndiscounts based on processing costs bypassed because of worksharing\nby mailers.\n\n\n\u2022\nProcedural history: Request filed by Postal Service on\nMarch 7, 2001.

It seems that during an examination one day a bright young student popped up and asked the proctor to bring him Cakes and Ale. The following dialog ensued: \nProctor: I beg your pardon?\nStudent: Sir, I request that you bring me Cakes and Ale.\nProctor: Sorry, no.\nStudent: Sir, I really must insist. I request and require that you bring me Cakes and Ale. \nAt this point, the student produced a copy of the four hundred year old Laws of Cambridge, written in Latin and still nominally in effect, and pointed to the section which read (roughly translated): \"Gentlemen sitting examinations may request and require Cakes and Ale.\" \nPepsi and hamburgers were judged the modern equivalent, and the student sat there, writing his examination and happily slurping away. \nThree weeks later, the same student was fined five pounds for not wearing a sword to the examination.\n\n\nOff Key\u2026.\nTwo keys hang in the undertaker's office - one for the organ in the chapel; the other for one of the vehicles in the garage.\nTwo small signs above the keys read \"Hymns\" and \"Hearse.\"\n\n\nGreat Shape\nYou're in incredible shape,\" the doctor said. \"How old are you again?\"\n\"I am 78.\" The man said.\n\"78!\" replied the doctor. \"How do you stay so healthy?

You haven't done any testing on him or anything. I want another opinion!\"\nWith that, the vet turned and left the room. In a few moments, he returned with a Labrador Retriever. The Retriever went right to work, checking the poor dead dog out thoroughly. After a considerable amount of sniffing, The Retriever sadly shook its head and barked. The veterinarian then took the Labrador out and returned in a few moments with a cat, who also checked out the poor dog on the table. As had its predecessors, the cat sadly shook its head and meowed. It then jumped off the table and ran out of the room.\nThe veterinarian handed the man a bill for 600 dollars. The dog's owner went berserk. \"600 dollars! Just to tell me my dog is dead? This is outrageous!\"\nThe vet shook his head sadly and explained. \"If you had taken my word or it, it would have been 50 dollars, but you insisted on the Lab report and the Cat scan.....\" \n\n\nSame on the other side, but different. \nA Tibetan housewife smelled something burning in the kitchen. \nWhen she rushed in and saw smoke pouring out of the oven she cried out, \"Oh, my baking yak!\"\n\n\nA Line Joke\n\"According to a recent report, this years airline passengers have been subject to longer delays and ruder service than ever before. \nWhen interviewed about this, a spokesperson for the airlines said, 'Shut up and get back in line!' -- Conan O'Brien\nThe Price of Fame\u2026..\nThe doctor took his patient into a room and said, \"I have some good news and some bad news.\" \nThe patient said, \"Please give me the good news first.\" \n\"They're going to name a disease after you.\"\n\n\nToday's Joke - \nQ. What's black and blue, and floats in the Irish sea?\nA. The Englishman who told one too many Irish Jokes.........\n\n\nA classic tale. \nThis is a bricklayer's accident report, which was printed in the newsletter of the British equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board.\nThis is the true story. Had this guy died, he'd have received a Darwin Award for sure...\n\n\nDear Sir\nI am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put \" Poor planning\" as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient. \nam a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-storey building. When I completed my work, I found I had some bricks left over, which, when weighed later, were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs.\nRather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor. Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, I swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks. \nYou will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs. Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form. Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley.\nFortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience. At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight. As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body.\nHere my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I had to lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me. This explains the two broken legs.\nI hope this answers your inquiry.\n\n\nDeep thoughts from comedian Steven Wright....... \nA bus station is where a bus stops.

(For those with short attention spans, the Kursk was the submarine that blew up and sank in the Arctic Ocean killing all 118 on board.) The Russians tried to blame the incident on a collision with an unidentified object. However, sonar tapes which recorded the blasts (a small one at first, then a much larger one, two minutes later), cast doubt on these claims. \nA whistle-blower within the Russian military has leaked that the crew of the Kursk was testing a new type of torpedo when the accident occurred. It seemed very likely that the test didn't go quite as planned. While rescue efforts to save the survivors of the Kursk failed, salvage crews were able to recover a 'Black Box' from the submarine which recorded events leading up to the explosion. \nAs luck would have it, we managed to obtain a copy of those tapes. It turns out that the submarine crew was trying to load Microsoft Windows on their fire control computer. Their intent was to replace the aging CP/M operating system with the flashier Windows OS. Apparently, the Russians didn't know about the legendary stability problems exhibited by Windows. The log tapes make this painfully obvious: \n\n\nCaptain: Is the new fire control Windows OS installed yet? \nSeaman: Almost Sir.

READ ON........\n\nGreen Garden Grass snakes can be dangerous, Yes, grass snakes, not rattlesnakes.\nA couple in Sweetwater, Texas had a lot of potted plants, and during a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze. It turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants and when it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa. She let out a very loud scream.\nThe husband who was taking a shower ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was. She told him there was a snake under the sofa. He got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it.\nAbout that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him on the leg. He thought the snake had bitten him and he fainted. His wife thought he had a heart attack, so she called an ambulance. The attendants rushed in and loaded him on the stretcher and started carrying him out. About that time the snake came out from under the sofa and the Emergency Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher. That's when the man broke his leg and why he is in the hospital.\nThe wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor man. He volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch.\nSoon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief. But in relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt the snake wriggling around. She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa, and the neighbor man, seeing her laying there passed out tried to use CPR to revive her.\nThe neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches. An ambulance was again called and it was determined that the injury required hospitalization.\nThe noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed he had been bitten by the snake. She went to the kitchen, brought back a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.\nBy now the police had arrived. They saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred. They were about to arrest them all, when the two women tried to explain how it all happened over a little green snake. They called an ambulance, which took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife.\nJust then the little snake crawled out from under the couch. One of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it. He missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table that was on one side of the sofa. The table fell over and the lamp on it shattered and as the bulb broke, it started a fire in the drapes.\nThe other policeman tried to beat out the flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog, who startled, jumped up and raced out into the street, where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car and set it on fire. Meanwhile the burning\ndrapes had spread to the walls and the entire house was blazing.\nNeighbors had called the fire department and the arriving fire-truck had started raising his ladder as they were halfway down the street. The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires and put out the electricity and disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area.\nTime passed... Both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was re-built, the police acquired a new car, and all was right with their world -------\nAbout a year later they were watching TV and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night. The husband asked his wife if she thought they should bring in their plants for the night. She shot him.\n\n\nBirth Control Pill\nSadie: Doctor, write for me a prescription for birth control pills.\nDoctor: You're in your eighties, you don't need them. \nSadie: I know what I need, write for me please the prescription.\nThe doctor gives her the prescription. Several weeks later she is again in the doctor's office.\nDoctor: So how are you feeling Sadie?\nSadie: I feel wonderful. Now I sleep like a baby. Thank you for the pills.\nDoctor: But those were birth control pills, not sleeping pills.\nSadie: Listen to me. Every morning I put one in my granddaughter's orange juice, and now I can sleep like a baby.\n\n\nCollectibles\nShowing his friend around his home, Myrddin started to point out all of the collectibles he and his wife had acquired over their long years of marriage. \"The day before I die, I'd like to sell every piece we've got just to see how much it's all worth.\"\n\"But you couldn't possibly know the day before you were going to die, so how could you sell it.\"\n\"Simple: If I sell it, my wife would kill me!\"\n\n\nMemory Clinic\nTwo elderly couples were enjoying friendly conversation when one of the men asked the other, \"Fred, how was the memory clinic you went to last month?\" \n\"Outstanding,\" Fred replied. \"They taught us all the latest psychological techniques-visualization, association - it has made a big difference for me.\" \n\"That's great! What was the name of that clinic?\" \nFred went blank. He thought and thought but couldn't remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, \"What do you call that flower with the long stem and thorns?\" \n\"You mean a rose?\" \n\"Yes, that's it!\" He turned to his wife...\"Rose, what was the name of that clinic?\n\n\nQuestions \nA veterinarian was feeling ill and went to see her doctor. The doctor asked her all the usual questions, about symptoms, how long had they been occurring, etc., when she interrupted him, \"I'm a veterinarian and I don't need to ask my patients these kind of questions. I can tell what's wrong just by looking.\" She smugly added, \"Why can't you?\" \nThe doctor nodded, stood back, and looked her up and down. He then quickly wrote out a prescription, handed it to her and said, \"There you are. Of course, if that doesn't work, then we'll just have to have you put to sleep.\"\n\n\nRare Pottery\nIn front of a delicatessen, an art connoisseur noticed a mangy little kitten lapping up milk from a saucer. The saucer, he realized with a start, was a rare and precious piece of pottery. He strolled into the store and offered two dollars for the cat. \n\"It's not for sale,\" said the proprietor.\n\"Look,\" said the collector, \"that cat is dirty and undesirable, but I'm eccentric. I like cats that way. I'll raise my offer to ten dollars.\" \n\"It's a deal,\" said the proprietor, and pocketed the ten on the spot.\n\"For that sum I'm sure you won't mind throwing in the saucer,\" said the connoisseur. \"The kitten seems so happy drinking from it.\"\n\"Nothing doing,\" said the proprietor firmly. \"That's my lucky saucer. From that saucer, so far this week I've sold 34 cats.\"\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "jokes11", "class": "jokes"}

As they \"oohed and aahed\" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. \"It's free,\" Peter replied, \"this is Heaven.\"\nNext they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, \"What are the green fees?\" Peter's reply, \"This is heaven, you play for free.\"\nNext they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the world laid out. \"How much to eat?\" asked the old man. \"Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!\" Peter replied with some exasperation. \n\"Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?\" the old man asked timidly. Peter lectured, \"That's the best part...you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven.\" \nWith that the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it and shrieking wildly.

You must get the boat safely to shore.\" \nSo she drove the boat to shore.\nThat evening, the wife walked into the living room where her husband was watching television.

Jake asked her, \"What are you up to?\" \nAlice smiled. \"I'm going hunting with you!\"\nJake, though he had many reservations about this, reluctantly decided to take her along. Later they arrived at the hunting site. Jake set his wife safely up in the tree stand and told her, \"If you see a deer, take careful aim and I'll come running back as soon as I hear the shot.\"\nJake walked away with a smile on his face knowing that Alice couldn't bag an elephant, much less a deer. Not 10 minutes passed when he was startled as he heard an array of gunshots.\nQuickly, Jake ran back. As Jake got closer to her stand, he heard Alice screaming: \"Get away from my deer!\"\nConfused, Jake raced faster towards his screaming wife.

He searched all over Paris seeking a suitable place to raise his rabbits. None could be found.\nFinally, an old priest at the cathedral said he could have a small area behind the rectory for his rabbits. He successfully raised a number of them, and when he went about Paris selling them, a restaurant owner asked him where he got such fresh rabbits.\nThe young man replied, \"I raise them myself, near the cathedral. In fact, I have ... a hutch back of Notre Dame.\"\n    \n\n360 Circle\n\nThe air controller, working a busy pattern, told the 727 on downwind to make a three-sixty (do a complete circle, usually to provide spacing between aircraft).\nThe pilot of the 727 complained, \"Do you know it costs us two thousand dollars to make a three-sixty in this airplane?\nWithout missing a beat the controller replied, \"Roger, give me four thousand dollars worth!\"\n\n\nMade it to Heaven?\nA woman was worried whether or not her dead husband made it to heaven, so she decided to try to contact his spirit by having a seance.\nSure enough, after the usual mumbo-jumbo of calling to the spirits, her husband's voice was heard answering, \"Helloooooo\u2026 Margaret, this is meeee...\"\n\"Fred,\" she answered.

The bank thought it amusing enough to publish it in the New York Times.\nDear Sir,\nI am writing to thank you for bouncing the cheque with which I endeavoured to pay my plumber last month. By my calculations some three nanoseconds must have elapsed between his presenting the cheque, and the arrival in my account of the funds needed to honour it. I refer, of course, to the automatic monthly deposit of my entire salary, an arrangement which, I admit, has only been in place for eight years. You are to be commended for seizing that brief window of opportunity, and also for debiting my account with $50 by way of penalty for the inconvenience I caused your bank.\nMy thankfulness springs from the manner in which this incident has caused me to re-think my errant financial ways. You have set me on the path of fiscal righteousness. No more will our relationship be blighted by these unpleasant incidents, for I am restructuring my affairs in 2000, taking as my model the procedures, attitudes and conduct of your very bank. I can think of no greater compliment, and I know you will be excited and proud to hear it. To this end, please be advised about the following:\nFirst, I have noticed that whereas I personally attend to your telephone calls and letters, when I try to contact you I am confronted by the impersonal, ever-changing, pre-recorded, faceless entity which your bank has become.\nFrom now on I, like you, choose only to deal with a flesh and blood person. My mortgage and loan repayments will, therefore and hereafter, no longer be automatic, but will arrive at your bank, by cheque, addressed personally and confidentially to an employee of your branch, whom you must nominate. You will be aware that it is an offence under the Postal Act for any other person to open such an envelope. \nPlease find attached an Application Contact Status which I require your chosen employee to complete. I am sorry it runs to eight pages, but in order that I know as much about him or her as your bank knows about me, there is no alternative.\nPlease note that all copies of his or her medical history must be countersigned by a Justice of the Peace, and that the mandatory details of his/her financial situation (income, debts, assets and liabilities) must be accompanied by documented proof. In due course I will issue your employee with a PIN number which he/she must quote in all dealings with me.\nI regret that it cannot be shorter than 28 digits but, again, I have modeled it on the number of button presses required to access my account balance on your phone bank service. As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\nLet me level the playing field even further by introducing you to my new telephone system, which you will notice, is very much like yours. My Authorised Contact at your bank, the only person with whom I will have any dealings, may call me at any time and will be answered by an automated voice. By pressing Buttons on the phone, he/she will be guided through an extensive set of menus: \n1. To make an appointment to see me.\n2. To query a missing repayment.\n3. To make a general complaint or inquiry.\n4. To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there; Extension of living room to be communicated at the time the call is received.\n5. To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping; Extension of bedroom to be communicated at the time the call is received.\n6. To transfer the call to my toilet in case I am attending to nature; Extension of toilet to be communicated at the time the call is received.\n7. To transfer the call to my mobile phone in case I am not at home.\n8. To leave a message on my computer. To leave a message a password to access my computer is required. Password will be communicated at a later date to the contact.\n9. To return to the main menu and listen carefully to options 1 to 25 The contact will then be put on hold, pending the attention of my automated answering service. While this may on occasion involve a lengthy wait, uplifting music will play for the duration. \nThis month I've chosen a refrain from The Best Of Woody Guthrie:\n.......\"Oh, the banks are made of marble\n....... With a guard at every door\n....... And the vaults are filled with silver\n....... That the miners sweated for\"\nAfter twenty minutes of that, our mutual contact will probably know it off by heart.\nOn a more serious note, we come to the matter of cost. As your bank has often pointed out, the ongoing drive for greater efficiency comes at a cost, a cost which you have always been quick to pass on to me. Let me repay your kindness by passing some costs back. First, there is the matter of advertising material you send me. This I will read for a fee of $20/page. Enquiries from your nominated contact will be billed at $5 per minute of my time spent in response.\nAny debits to my account, as, for example, in the matter of the penalty for the dishonoured cheque, will be passed back to you. My new phone service runs at 75 cents a minute (even Woody Guthrie doesn't come free), so you would be well advised to keep your enquiries brief and to the point. Regrettably, but again following your example, I must also levy an establishment fee to cover the setting up of this new arrangement.\nName\nYour humble client.\n\n\nSaid in Court\nThese are things people actually said in court, word for word, taken down and now published by court reporters who had the torment of staying calm while these exchanges were actually taking place:\nQ: What was the first thing your husband said to you when he woke that morning?\nA: He said, \"Where am I, Cathy?\"\nQ: And why did that upset you?\nA: My name is Susan.\n\n\nQ: And where was the location of the accident?\nA: Approximately milepost 499.\nQ: And where is milepost 499?\nA: Probably between milepost 498 and 500.\n\n\nQ: Did you blow your horn or anything?\nA: After the accident?\nQ: Before the accident.\nA: Sure, I played for ten years. I even went to school for it.\n\n\nBox Clever?\nWhen I was a kid, we had a quicksand box in the back yard. Eventually I\nwas an only child. - Steven Wright\n\n\nDue Credit\nThe trouble with doing something right the first time, is then that nobody\nappreciates how difficult it was.\n\n\nAin't that so\u2026?\nPaper is always strongest at the perforations.\n\n\nA Straight line\u2026.\nLaughter is the shortest distance between two people.\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "jokes16", "class": "jokes"}

Curious about its depth they threw in a pebble and waited for the sound of it striking the bottom, but they heard nothing. They went and got a bigger rock, threw it in and waited. Still nothing. They searched the area for something larger and came upon a railroad tie. With great difficulty, the two men carried it to the opening and threw it in. While waiting for it to hit bottom, a goat suddenly darted between them and leapt into the hole!\nThe guys were still standing there with astonished looks upon their faces from the actions of the goat when a man walked up to them.

It has been proposed to strap giant slabs of hot buttered toast to the backs of hundreds of tethered cats; the two opposing forces will cause the cats to hover, spinning inches above the ground. Using the power generated by this giant buttered toast-cat array, a high-speed monorail could easily link New York with Chicago.\n\n\nPardon Me? \nA man goes into a drug store and asks the pharmacist if he can give him something to stop hiccups.

The bartender says, \"Get out of here with that dog!\"\nThe guy says, \"But this isn't just any dog... this dog can play the piano!\"\nThe bartender replies, \"Well, if he can play that piano, you both can stay... and have a drink on the house!\"\nSo the guy sits the dog at the piano, and the dog starts playing ragtime, a little swing, some Gershwin. The bartender is amazed and patrons are enjoying the music when suddenly a bigger dog runs in, grabs the small dog by the scruff of the neck, and drags him out. The bartender asks the guy, \"What was that all about?\"\nThe guy replies, \"Oh, that was his mother.

Cats are independent, they don't listen, they don't come in when you call, they like to stay out all night, and when they are home they either want to be left alone and sleep, or they want to eat. In other words, all those things that women hate in a man, they love in a cat.\n\n\nToo Fly\nTwo caterpillars are sitting on a leaf when a butterfly zooms by, startling them.\nOne turns to the other and says, \"Boy, you'll never get ME up in one of them things.\"\n\n\nGive it Eleven\n\"The English are not very spiritual people, so they invented cricket to give themselves some idea of eternity.\" -George Bernard Shaw\n\n\nHow's That? \nThere are some people so addicted to exaggeration that they can't even tell the truth without lying.\" --Josh Billings\n\n\nDig this\u2026\n\"I don't see why they say marriage is the pits - all my marriages have worked fine.\" (Unknown)\nMom says\u2026.\n\"Every teenager should get a good high school education; even if they already know everything.\" \n\n\nRight on, Dad. \n\"I told him, 'Son, what is it with you?

They announced his disappearance on the radio and television as well as in the newspapers, but no one reported seeing the ape.\nAt last, the ape was found in the Public Library. Officials of the zoo and the animal keepers were summoned to the library. They found the ape sitting at a desk in the reading room with two books spread out in front of him. The ape was reading with great concentration. One book was the Bible; the other was a book written by Darwin.\nWhen the zookeepers asked the ape what he was doing, the ape replied, \"I'm trying to figure out whether I am my brother's keeper or my keeper's brother.\"\n\n\nStretched Truth. \nTwo guys who worked together were both laid off, so off they went to the unemployment office. When asked his occupation, the first guy said, \"Panty stitcher...I sew the elastic onto women's panties.\"\nThe clerk looked up panty stitcher. Finding it classed as unskilled labor, she gave him $300 a week unemployment pay. \nThe second guy was asked his occupation. \"Diesel fitter,\" he replied. Diesel fitter is listed as a skilled job, so the clerk gave the second guy $600 a week.\nWhen the first guy found out he was furious. He stormed into the office to find out why his friend and co-worker was collecting double his pay.\nThe clerk explained, \"Panty stitchers are unskilled, but diesel fitters are skilled labor.\"\n\"What skill?!\" yelled the panty stitcher. \"I sew the elastic on and then he stretches it out tight and decides, Yep, dese'll fit 'er.\"\n\n\nUnsettled ! \n\"A bachelor is a selfish, undeserving guy who has cheated some woman out of a divorce.\" Don Quinn\n\n\nPeace Insurance\nGetting away from their high-stress work, a couple spend relaxing weekends in their motor home.

God came and said, \"Follow me and I will give you your rooms.\"\nSo they both followed. First God gave the Pope his room; it was very small with a small bed and a small desk. \"Thank you, thank you my lord,\" said The Pope.\nThen God gave the lawyer his room; it was big room with a big bed and a big deck with a pool and a pretty woman. \"Mr. God, why are you giving this room to me and the other little one to The Pope?\" the lawyer asked.\n\"Well, popes we get regular as clockwork, but you're our first lawyer.\"\n\n\nPrezackly! \nA Zen master once said to me, \"Do the opposite of whatever I tell you.\" So I didn't. --Unknown\n\"My doctor tells me I suffer from extreme hypochondria.

While wandering about he notices a leopard heading in his direction with the intention of having lunch. The dog thinks, \"Boy, now I'm in deep trouble.\"\nThen he sees some bones on the ground close by, and immediately settles down to chew on the remains with his back to the approaching cat.\nJust as the leopard is about to leap, the dog exclaims loudly, \"Hey, that was one delicious leopard. I wonder if there are any more like that around here?\"\nHearing this the leopard halts his attack in mid stride, and he slinks away into the trees. \"Whew\", says the leopard. \"That was close. That dog could've nearly had me.\"\nMeanwhile, a monkey who had been watching all this from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So, he goes chasing after the leopard. \nBut the dog saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figured that something must be up.\nThe monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The cat is furious at being made a fool of and says, \"Here monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that smart aleck dog.\"\nNow the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks,\" What am I going to do now?\"\nBut instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers pretending he hasn't seen them yet. And just when they get close enough to hear, the dog says, \"Where's that cheeky monkey. I can never trust him.

Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses. \n6. Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included. \n7. Reclassifying the dead horse as \"living-impaired.\" \n8. Hiring outside contractors to ride the dead horse. \n9. Harnessing two or more dead horses together to increase speed. \n10. Providing additional funding and/or training to increase the dead horse's performance. \n11. Doing a productivity study to see if lighter riders would improve the dead horse's performance. \n12. Declaring that the dead horse carries lower overhead and therefore contributes more to the bottom line then younger, more vigorous horses. \n13.

Female Friendship - Why Your Best Friends Aren't The ones Who Complain About You The Most\nSmall Town Church\nOn vacation with her family in Montana, a mother drove her van past a church in a small town and pointing to it, told the children that it was St. Andrews Church.\nJust then, her young son piped up, \"It must be a franchise, we've got one of those at home too.\"\n\n\nBig Rocks\nA lady on her first visit to Yellowstone National Park said to her guide, \"Look at all those big rocks. Wherever did they come from?\"\n\"The glaciers brought them down,\" said the guide.\n\"Well, where are the glaciers then?\"\n\"The glaciers, dear lady,\" said the guide in a weary voice, \"have gone back to get more rocks.\"\n\n\nWords To Live By\nIf at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried. \nA conclusion is the place where you gave up thinking.\nFor every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. \nHe who hesitates is probably right. \nNever do card tricks for the group you play poker with. \nNo one is listening until you make a mistake. \nSuccess always occurs in private, and failure in full view.\nThe colder the X-ray table, the more of your body is required on it. \nThe hardness of butter is proportional to the softness of the bread. \nThe severity of the itch is proportional to the difficulty of reach. \nThe affection of your dog is proportional to the wetness of it's paws.\nTo steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many is research. \nTo succeed in politics, it is often necessary to rise above your principles. \nTwo wrongs are only the beginning. \nYou never really learn to swear until you meet computer (Micro)software. \nMonday is a truly awful way to spend 1/7th of your life. \nThe further you fall behind, the more time you'll have to catch up. \nA clear conscience is probably the sign of a bad memory. \nIf you must choose between two evils, pick the most interesting one. \nChange is inevitable....except from vending machines. \nDon't sweat petty things....or pet sweaty things. \nA fool and his money are soon partying. \nMoney can't buy love. But it CAN rent a very close imitation. \nAlways try to be modest: And be proud of it! \nIf you think nobody cares about you, try missing a couple of payments. \nHow many of you believe in telekinesis? Raise my hand.... \nIf you get a new car for your spouse -- it'll be a great trade! \nDrugs may lead to nowhere, but at least it's the scenic route. \nI'd kill for a Nobel P(e)ace Prize. \nPlan to be spontaneous all day tomorrow. \nEverybody repeat after me.....\"We are all individuals.\"\n\n\n\nThe Quick and the Dead\nJoe, the Governor's most trusted assistant, died in his sleep one night. The Governor had depended on Joe for advice on every subject, from pending bills to wardrobe decisions. In addition, Joe had been his closest friend. So, it was understandable that the Governor didn't take kindly to the droves of ambitious office seekers who wanted Joe's job. \"They don't even have the decency to wait until the man is buried,\" the Governor muttered.\nAt the funeral, one eager beaver made his way to the Governor's side. \"Governor,\" the man said, \"is there a chance that I could take over Joe's place?\"\n\"Certainly,\" the governor replied. \"But you'll have to hurry, I think the undertaker is nearly finished.\"\n\n\nFraud Warning! \nWARNING! PLEASE READ IMMEDIATELY! THIS IS SERIOUS! \nIf you get an envelope from a company called the Internal Revenue Service, \"DO NOT OPEN IT!\"\nThis group operates a major scam around the same time every year. Their letter claims that you owe them money, which they will take and use to pay for the operation of essential functions of the government. This is untrue! The money the IRS collects is used to fund themselves and various other corporations which entirely depend on these 'subsidies' to stay in business. \nThis organization has ties to another questionable organization called the Social Security Administration, who claim to take money from your regular paychecks and save it for your retirement. This is not so. In truth, the SSA uses the money to pay for it's own overheads and the same misguided corporate welfare the IRS helps to mastermind. \nThese scam artists have bilked honest, hard working citizens out of billions of dollars. Don't you be among them!\n\n\nGetting on\u2026\nMiddle age is when you burn the midnight oil around 9:00 pm.\n\n\nRelated?\nA couple drove several miles down a country road, not saying a word after an earlier discussion had led to an argument, and neither wanted to concede their position.\nAs they passed a barnyard of mules and pigs, the wife sarcastically asked, \"Relatives of yours?\"\n\"Yep,\" the husband replied, \"In-laws.\"\n\n\nBad Landing\nAn airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy, which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, give a smile, and a \"Thanks for flying XYZ airline.\" \nHe said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment, but no one seemed annoyed.\nFinally everyone had gotten off except for one little old lady walking with a cane. She approached and asked, conspiratorially, \"Sonny, do you mind if I ask you a question?\"\n\"Why no Ma'am, what is it?\" \n\"Did we land, or were we shot down?\"\n\n\nOh God! Save Me!\nThere is this atheist swimming in the ocean. All of a sudden he sees this shark in the water, so he starts swimming towards his boat. As he looks back he sees the shark turn and head towards him. His boat is a ways off and he starts swimming like crazy. He's scared to death, and as he turns to see the jaws of the great white beast open revealing its teeth in a horrific splendor, the atheist screams, \"Oh God! Save me!\" \nIn an instant time is frozen and a bright light shines down from above. The man is motionless in the water when he hears the voice of God say, \"You are an atheist. Why do you call upon me when you do not believe in me?\" \nAghast with confusion and knowing he can't lie the man replies, \"Well, that's true, I don't believe in you, but how about the shark? Can you make the shark believe in you?\n\"The Lord replies, \"As you wish,\" and the light retracted back into the heavens and the man could feel the water begin to move once again. As the atheist looks back he can see the jaws of the shark start to close down on him, when all of sudden the shark stops and pulls back. \nShocked, the man looks at the shark as the huge beast closes its eyes and bows its head and says, \"Thank you Lord for this food which I am about to receive...\"\n\n\nWays To Simulate Ski Season\nThis is to remind skiers how to prepare for the ski season and to remind non-skiers why they do not ski. \n10. Visit your local butcher and pay $30 to sit in the walk-in freezer for half an hour. Afterwards, burn two $50 dollar bills to warm up.\n9. Go to the nearest hockey rink and walk across the ice 20 times in your ski boots carrying two pairs of skis, accessory bag and poles. Pretend you are looking for your car. \n8. For ski boot simulation at home, put a pebble in your street shoes and tighten a C-clamp around your toes. \n7. Buy a pair of gloves and immediately throw one away. \n6. Go to McDonald's and insist on paying $6.50 for a hamburger. Be sure to wait in the longest line. \n5. Clip a lift ticket to the zipper of your jacket and ride a motorcycle fast enough to make the ticket lacerate your face. \n4. Drive slowly for five hours - anywhere - as long as it's in a snowstorm and you're following an 18 wheeler. \n3. Fill a blender with ice, hit the pulse button and let the spray blast your face. You'd almost believe you're skiing in front of a snow maker! \n2. Dress up in as many clothes as you can and then proceed to take them off because you have to go to the bathroom. \n1. Repeat all of the above every Saturday and Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "jokes5", "class": "jokes"}

When he opens it, he is confronted by a little Chinese man, clutching a clipboard and yelling, \"You Sign! You sign!\" Behind him is an enormous truck full of car exhausts. \nNelson is standing there in complete amazement, when the Chinese man starts to yell louder. \"You Sign! You sign!\" \nNelson says to him, \"Look, you've obviously got the wrong man\", and shuts the door in his face.\nThe next day he hears a knock at the door again.

So for fun she split the class into two groups appropriately enough, by gender and asked them to decide whether Computer should be a masculine or feminine noun.\nBoth groups were required to give four reasons for their recommendation. The boy's group decided that computers should definitely be of the feminine gender (\"la computer\"), because:\n1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic;\n2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else;\n3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for possible later retrieval; and\n4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your salary on accessories for it.\nThe women's group, however, concluded that computers should be masculine(\"le computer\"), because:\n1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on;\n2. They have a lot of data but they are still clueless;\n3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE the problem; and\n4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you'd waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.\n\n\nWHY WE LOVE CHILDREN:\nA small boy is sent to bed by his father.

Is it your Easter dress?\"\nThe little girl replied, directly into the pastor's clip-on microphone, \"Yes, and my Mom says it's a bitch to iron.\"\n\n\nFinding one of her students making faces at others on the playground, Ms. Smith stopped to gently reprove the child.

He told them to knock it off and let him get some sleep but they persisted in hassling him to no end until finally he gave in.\n\"OK!\" he said with exasperation, \"Follow me.\" and he flew out of the cave with hundreds of bats following close behind him. Down through the valley they went, across the river and into the deep forest. Finally he slowed down and all the other bats excitedly gathered around him.\n\"Do you see that tree over there?\" he asked.\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" the other bats all screamed in a frenzy.\n\"Good,\" said the first bat, \"Because I DIDN'T!\"\n\n\n666 (Which is the number of the Anti-Christ)\nThere is something very sinister about this. 666 is exactly 2.138 times the height of the pyramid of Cheops and if we multiply the height of the pyramid by 3.36 million, we get the EXACT, let me repeat that - EXACT - distance to the moon.\nThis next part is much more than mere coincidence: if you drop the zeros off 3.36 million and then add the first 3 to the 36, you get a figure which is EXACTLY equal to the age that Bill Gates would have been on his 39th birthday.\nThis provides CONCLUSIVE proof that Bill Gates is either an extraterrestrial or a pyramid.\n\n\nCopyright Explained\nWhen you write copy you have the right to copyright the copy you write, if the copy is right. If however, your copy falls over, you must right your copy.

A right wing cleric would write right rite, and has the right to copyright the right rite he has the right to write. His editor has the job of making the right rite copy right before the copyright can be right.\nShould Mr Wright decide to write right rite, then Wright would write right rite, which Wright has the right to copyright. Duplicating that rite would copy Wright right rite, and violate copyright, which Wright would have the right to right.\nRight?\n\n\nOld Hermit \nAn old guy who'd spent his whole life as a recluse in the desert goes to visit a friend.

Looking around, he sees a train bearing down on him like something out of the Apocalypse. The train just nudges him a glancing blow, but it still flips him into an arroyo, where his head smacks up against a rock and knocks him colder'n a witch's heart.\nA while later he gets up, tenderly feeling the bump on his head and shrugging off the dust, and continues onto his friend's house, the whole time wondering what the devil that big darn thing was that nearly killed him. \nHis friend greets him, puts on a kettle of tea, and they start swapping old lies.

Feeling better, the man asks the missionary for directions to the nearest town. \nOn his way out the back door, he sees this horse. He goes back into the house and asks the missionary, \"Could I borrow your horse and give it back when I reach the town?\" The missionary says, \"Sure but there is a special thing about this horse. You have to say 'Thank God' to make it go and 'Amen' to make it stop.\" \nNot paying much attention, the man says, \"Sure, OK.\" So he gets on the horse and says, \"Thank God\" and the horse starts walking. Then he says, \"Thank God, thank God,\" and the horse starts trotting. Feeling really brave, the man says, \"Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God\" and the horse just about takes off. \nPretty soon he sees this cliff coming up and he's doing everything he can to make the horse stop. \"Whoa, stop, hold on!!!! \"Finally he remembers, \"Amen!!\" and the horse skids to a stop 4 inches from the edge of the cliff.

Always avoid alliteration.\n2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.\n3. Avoid cliches like the plague--they're old hat.\n4. Employ the vernacular.\n5. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.\n6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.\n7. Parenthetical words however must be enclosed in commas.\n8. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.\n9. Contractions aren't necessary.\n10. Do not use a foreign word when there is an adequate English quid pro quo.\n11. One should never generalize.\n12. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said: \"I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.\"\n13. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.\n14. Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary; it's highly superfluous.\n15. Profanity sucks.\n16. Be more or less specific.\n17. Understatement is always best.\n18. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.\n19. One-word sentences? Eliminate.\n20. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake\n21. The passive voice should not be used.\n22. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.\n23. Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixed metaphors--even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed. \n24. Who needs rhetorical questions?\n25. Don't use commas, that, are not necessary.\n26. Do not use hyperbole; not one in a million can do it effectively.\n27. Never use a big word when a diminutive alternative would suffice.\n28. Subject and verb always has to agree.\n29. It behooves you to avoid archaic expressions. Avoid archaeic spellings too.\n30. Placing a comma between subject and predicate, is not correct.\n31. Use your spell checker to avoid mispelling and to catch typograhpical errors.\n32. Don't repeat yourself, or say again what you have said before.\n33. Don't be redundant.\n34. Use the apostrophe in it's proper place and omit it when its not needed.\n35. Don't never use no double negatives.\n36. Poofread carefully to see if you any words out.\n37. Hopefully, you will use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.\n38. Eschew obfuscation.\n39. No sentence fragments.\n40. Don't indulge in sesquipedalian lexicological construction\n41. A writer must not shift your point of view.\n42. Don't overuse exclamation marks!!\n43. Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long sentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.\n44. Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.\n45. If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking verb is.\n46. Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.\n47. Everyone should be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.\n48. Always pick on the correct idiom.\n49. The adverb always follows the verb.\n50. And always be sure to finish what\n\n\nJell-O\nFreddy had never seen a plate of Jell-O.

With that in mind, Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the\nIntellectual Dishonesty (henceforth to be known as the Indis )\nIndex . Here's how it works: Publications that refuse to acknowledge\n(even if to refute the importance of) highly significant but inconvenient facts\nin their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one\npoint for the initial offense. They will then score one point for\nevery subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense\nis noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient\nfact--and an additional two points on days when the news organization\nruns a follow-up without making note of said inconvenient fact.\nPublications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of\nFame . Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness\nof Joseph Stalin. (Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase\n\"intellectual dishonesty,\" because it's pompous and falsely suggests that only\nintellectuals can be intellectually dishonest. But Chatterbox doesn't know any\nother easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of\noffense.)\n\n            For the purposes of this survey, the Wall Street Journal will be\ncounted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal 's\neditorial page, because, in essence, it is.\n\n            The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma\nKelsey, the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people\npartially corroborating Broaddrick's rape accusation, is the daughter of a man\nwhose murderer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton. (A responsible account of the\nwhole controversy in today's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon\nhad nothing to do with her corroboration.) The Journal editorial page\ngets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op-Ed by\nDorothy Rabinowitz on Feb. 19. Because it has published three times since the\ninitial omission, it scores an additional three points. And because it\npublished an editorial Feb. 22 taunting the rest of the press for not following\nit on the story--and still didn't mention the pardon--it scores an extra\ntwo points. That comes to a total of six . Chatterbox feels\ncertain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow-up\ntomorrow to tonight's NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview, which\nmeans that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it\nwill be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest!\n\n            Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus\npoints for having \"eventually convinced\" Broaddrick to grant an interview to\nthe New York Times (as the Times reports in today's story). But\nthe Scientific Method does not permit any tinkering with the Indis\nIndex 's scoring procedures. And besides, Rabinowitz's efforts on the\nTimes ' behalf weren't really unethical, just puzzling, given the two\nnewspapers' intense rivalry. When Chatterbox asked the Journal 's DC\nbureau chief, Alan Murray, who exercised good judgment in not breaking\nthe Broaddrick story (and--full disclosure-- is Chatterbox's former boss), to\ncomment about a Journal employee's feeding sources to the Times ,\nhe replied: \"I don't really have any comment on what the edit page did. They do\ntheir thing, we do ours.\" Which is what Journal news employees are\ninstructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing\nembarrassment.\n\n            For her part, Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf\nof the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them\nsound. \"Ms. Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared\nat the house in the a.m., and that she had refused an interview,\" Rabinowitz\nwrites in an e-mail message. \"I asked her why she had decided to talk to the\nNew York Post 's Steve Dunleavy, and refused a Times reporter. She\nsaid Dunleavy caught her by surprise. She asked if I thought it would be all\nright to talk to the Times reporter. I told her it would be--certainly\nas all right as talking to Dunleavy. She said, 'Well, I'm sorry I didn't.' She\nsaid she would if he called again. I passed this on to [ Times reporter]\nFelicity Barringer during our second day's interview chat. So--that's how it\nhappens that in the New York Times piece today I'm\ndescribed--solemnly--as having 'eventually convinced' her to repeat the story\nto the New York Times.\"\n\n            \n               --Timothy Noah\n            \n\n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "Article247_327", "class": "journal"}

By running against Giuliani (who\nhas been reported in Vanity Fair to have a mistress--he denies it--and,\nby all accounts, has a sham marriage), the first lady could exact symbolic\nrevenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the\nDemocratic party at the same time! That's almost enough for Chatterbox\nto jump on the Hillary for Senate bandwagon.\n\n            The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton's\nmarital problems a major campaign issue. \"Giuliani makes Ken Starr look like a\npatsy,\" cried Time this week. But, er, wouldn't that be kind of a risky\nstrategy, given his own problematic union? Many have already opined that the\nmayor is too vituperative, too much of a loner to practice the congenial,\nteamwork-oriented politics of the Senate; other doubters have pointed to his\nhardhearted, uncaring social policies. The last thing he needs is to draw more\nattention to these qualities in his personal life.\n\n            Giuliani's estrangement from his wife, Donna Hanover, is made clear in an\ninterview with Hanover that appears in today's New York Times . Hanover \"would not say\nwhether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run\nfor Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did. But she did say in\nthe interview, which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation\nabout Hillary Rodham Clinton's interest in the same New York Senate seat, that\nMrs. Clinton is a 'very interesting' person. 'I think she's dynamic, and I\nthink she's very smart, and she's an amazing speaker,' Ms. Hanover said.\" And,\nfor a punch line: \"Ms. Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said this\nweek that Ms. Hanover had no comment on Mrs. Clinton's potential Senate\ncampaign.\" Does she have any comment on whether Ms. Hanover plans to be Hillary\nClinton's campaign manager?\n\n            \n               Indis Index \n               Update: NBC, in its Juanita Broaddrick broadcast\nlast night, turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by\nBroaddrick in the late 1970s that Bill Clinton raped her. This\ndiminishes-- slightly-- the significance of Norma Kelsey's possible\nmotives in verifying parts of Broaddrick's story. (One of the three is Kelsey's\nsister, whose motives can be similarly questioned; the other two heard\nBroaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip, as only Kelsey and\nBroaddrick's husband claim to have.) However, Chatterbox notes that NBC, like\nevery other responsible news organization that's covered this story, reported\nthat Norma Kelsey's father's killer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton, and\nremains perplexed that the Journal editorial page won't.

Almost every assignment is a\nchallenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier. I often feel as\nif I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount of\nreporting that is most often much more than I will ever need. I think that is\nwhy I welcomed doing a book--it gives one the ability to use so much of what is\nleft on the cutting room floor of daily journalism.\n\n            Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we\nnever add to stories. Most often reporters recount these tales with each other\nand with their sources rather than share them with the general public. Much of\nit, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it\nis largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some\nvery good stories. I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be\nwritten about this era (probably decades and decades hence as it is too close).\nIn any case, there certainly is no lack of information available about the\nmoguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons. I would\nposit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the\ncurrent age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur.\n\n            So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to\nwatch. The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully. I\npersonally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just\none man--at AOL, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other\n\"characters,\" for lack of a better word. So there, while you think of Case, you\nalso think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives.\nSteve Ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft, but\nit still seems to be Bill's show over there.\n\n            While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highly\namusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch\nlaughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and\nthe insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good. That's ironic, since I\nthink it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that\nAOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon\nValley. AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here, I am sure,\nsince its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati. Out\nin the D.C. area, they looked positively exciting next to all the\ngovernment-oriented contractors. I wonder if that means geography is destiny,\nand it's still location, location, location.\n\n            From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the really\nobvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age. I think it\nalmost does not matter what the judge does since it's clear that the balance of\npower is shifting again, although it not clear where it will land. Will the\nstrongman of the era be AOL, AT&T, Microsoft, or one of the big media\ncompanies? Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and\nencourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of\nbusinesses where none are allowed to dominate?\n\n            I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether\nit is AOL or Microsoft or Disney--is in charge of all our destinies: Babylon\nwas. That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem\npossible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire's grip on\nhumanity. But we all know how that story turned out.\n\n            Now I am getting way too philosophical, but this is my final missive, so why\nnot? Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going. As for\nme, I'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and, I guess, life--nobody\nknows.\n\n            Cheers,\nKara\n\n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "Article247_3500", "class": "journal"}

But USA Today stays with Princess Di.\n\n            The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday, she will \"read\nthe riot act\" to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism. Her goal will\nbe to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel,\ntelling him that there can be no more attempts at co-opting Hamas, and \"no more\nkisses\" of its leaders.\n\n            The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context. Given that the\ntroubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat and\nIsrael, but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Saudi\nArabia, the paper states that the U.S. is now facing the prospect that the\nmoderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq and\nIran is falling apart.\n\n            The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about\nwhether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon,\ndissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was\nambushed, with twelve deaths the result. Perhaps the most striking indicator of\na change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that\ncabinet member Ariel Sharon, who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israel\nentrenched in Lebanon in the first place, is among those urging a\nreconsideration of the deployment.\n\n            Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of its\ncontrolling stake of Compuserve, but it's the Post with the news that\nAOL is set to take it over.\n\n            The Wall Street Journal \"Outlook\" observes, \"In the U.S. job\nmarket, the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers,\" and\nstates that \"the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of\ncorporate downsizing,\" which left behind survivors who took stock of career\noptions and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land\nbetter offers, which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries.

The LAT , for instance, examines what it\ntakes to be a new \"cuddly-feely\" Britain born of the national grief experience.\nBut USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as\nwell. Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwill\nambassador job shortly before her death, and USAT reports that Le\nFigaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her family\nand children.\n\n            Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page\nand a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story. \"Not\neveryone in Calcutta, or India for that matter, is unanimous in praising the\nnun, whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but\nmade virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this\ncollapsing city's poor neighborhoods.

Doesn't that sound like\ncelebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory? How odd--and a good\nillustration of how trying to shoe-horn in a \"witty\" headline can drive you\ninto an idea that doesn't fit or is undeserved.

And\nthe pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortion\ntiming: Sixty-one percent of those polled thought abortions should be permitted\nduring the first trimester, but only 15 percent in the second and just 7\npercent in the third. (The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why a\nfocus on partial-birth abortions has proven politically advantageous for\nabortion foes.)

Last week, when the Lewinsky story was only\na few hours old, Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to\ndemonstrate his concern. \"These are probably the most serious allegations yet\nleveled against the president. There's no question that, if they're true, they\n... could lead to impeachment proceedings.\"\n\n            Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even\ndisgusting about Stephanopoulos' eager show of independence from the president?\nThe problem isn't so much his disloyalty. Political figures turn on each other\nfrom time to time, for good and bad reasons; we're used to it. Stephanopoulos\nwants to run for the Senate and doesn't want to seem a Clinton stooge. By\nlending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiar\ndefenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he's\nnot a fool.\n\n            The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in\nthe first place. During the 1992 campaign, when Gennifer Flowers first brought\nClinton's philandering to public attention, Stephanopoulos--as Clinton's chief\nspinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit artist--played a crucial role in\ndiscrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namely\nthat Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem. (Don't say Stephanopoulos didn't\nknow. Again, he's not a fool.) Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as any\nman to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments.\n\n            The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on\ntape. Early in the film, with the Flowers crisis in full bloom, Sam Donaldson\ninterviews Stephanopoulos, who blames it all on the \"Republican attack\nmachine.\" \"Gov. Clinton has no character problem,\" Stephanopoulos declares.\nDonaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to\ninfidelity. \"He said he had problems in his marriage,\" says Stephanopoulos,\ncorrecting Donaldson's deviation from the pre-scripted fudge-phrase of the day.\n(Today, of course, the president's defenders claim that Clinton admitted\ninfidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply\ndidn't care.)\n\n            Near the end of The War Room, Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone\nwho apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about to\npublicize. Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping\nquiet. \"You would be laughed at ...\" he tells the caller. \"I guarantee you that\nif you do this you'll never work in Democratic politics again. ... Nobody will\nbelieve you and people will think you're scum.\"\n\n            You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection\ntechniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to\nnot get caught. He was one of Clinton's principal enablers, to use a word\nemployed by Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times . When Democrats\nwonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton, they don't need to look much\nfurther than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos, Carville (and\na cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992.\n\n            Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst.\nIt's as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid-'50s to soberly rue the\ndamage wreaked by Sen. Joe McCarthy, without any apology for his own role. Much\nhas been made of the way famous wrongdoers (e.g.: Dick Morris, Marv Albert)\nrebound too quickly in our celebrity culture. But usually at least a nanosecond\nof contrition is required. Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going\nthrough the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the\ncountry. If Clinton, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting to\nexplode, then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and\nmuffled the ticking.\n\n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "Article247_66", "class": "journal"}

The issue of land sales has a long history as a subtheme of the\nJewish-Arab struggle.\n\n            The\n19 th century Jewish intellectuals who conceived of\nZionism --the idea that Jewish survival depends on the establishment of a\nJewish state in the biblical land of Israel--never worked out their ideology's\nlogistics. Jewish settlement in Palestine, then part of the decaying Ottoman\nEmpire, only proceeded piecemeal. In the 1880s and 1890s, about 25,000 Jews\nimmigrated to Palestine. Most integrated into multiethnic communities in the\ncities of Jaffa, Tiberias, and Jerusalem. A second wave of 30,000 immigrants\ncame between 1905 and 1914, many of whom were Labor Zionists who wanted the\nJewish state to be socialist. Extolling the virtues of manual labor, they\nacquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee Syrian and Lebanese landlords.\nThe \"New Palestinian Jew ,\" they said, needed to be physically tougher\nthan the brainy shopkeepers who had been trampled in Europe.\n\n            The Jewish National Fund was founded in 1904 for the\npurpose of buying up land from Arabs. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat\nin World War I, Britain acquired Palestine and promised (in the Balfour\nDeclaration) the creation of a Jewish state. In anticipation, Jews in Palestine\nbegan laying the groundwork for a greater sense of national identity. The\nJewish National Fund's charter was amended to mandate that Jewish land could\nnever be resold to Arabs or opened to non-Jewish employees.\n\n            Following\nJewish National Fund guidelines, farmers evicted Palestinian peasants living on\nthe newly acquired plots. The total number displaced was small. By 1946, Jews\nowned only 7 percent of Palestine, but the perceived threat of displacement was\nwidespread among Arabs. Starting around 1910, Arab newspapers railed against\nJewish land acquisition. Among the peasantry, rumors spread alleging an\nAnglo-Jewish conspiracy to remove Muslims from Palestine. Anxious to avoid\nbeing blamed for Palestinian landlessness, British officials began imposing\ntoken restrictions on Jewish land purchase in 1940. They publicly supported\nArab complaints that Jews were driving Arabs off the land.\n\n            \nPalestinians say evictions destroyed\ntheir way of life, forcing them to move from rural Palestine to crowded cities\nin search of work. They also say that the better-educated Jewish buyers had\nduped illiterate peasants into selling property.\n\n            The Arab\nNational Fund, created in 1931 by wealthy Arab families to purchase land for\ndisplaced peasants, was ineffective. During the 1930s, Palestinian responses\nturned violent . In 1934 Jerusalem's mufti, the spiritual leader of the\ncity's Muslims, decreed that believers were duty bound to murder other Muslims\nwho sold land to Jews. Arabs, who outnumbered Jews by more than 2-to-1,\nrevolted against Jewish land acquisition and British promises of Jewish\nnationhood. About 5,000 Arabs and several hundred Jews were killed in riots and\nguerrilla attacks between 1936 and 1939.\n\n            Zionists argued that the land purchases benefited all the\nterritory's residents. Jewish immigrants introduced modern agricultural\ntechnology , which increased productivity and helped fill the markets with\nfood to feed the growing Arab population. Zionists also maintain that Jews\nbecame a lucrative market for Arab-manufactured goods.\n\n            Some\nhistorians trace Palestinian landlessness to Palestine's entry into the\nworld economy in the 1880s. Urban commerce drew some peasants from their\nfamily farms. Other subsistence farmers found themselves competing with\ncash-crop entrepreneurs (Jews and Arabs) whose successes changed the face of\nPalestinian agriculture. Jewish land purchases were not the primary factor,\nthese historians say.\n\n            \nVery little of the land owned today by\nindividual Jews and the Israeli government was acquired by purchase. Jewish\nsovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are: by\nwar. Israel confiscated all land owned by the British government, mostly desert\nand mountains, after the 1948 War of Independence . Property owned by\nArab refugees, who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by the\nIsraeli army (another long-standing controversy), was also taken over by\nindividual Jews or confiscated by the government. Many Palestinians, however,\nstayed put, retained their land, and became Israeli citizens.\n\n            A new\nschool of Jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by\nJewish land acquisition, and concludes that it was not always fair. One popular\ntheory compares Zionism's imperative to acquire land to the American idea of\nManifest Destiny (that it was the United States' God-given right to rule\nfrom coast to coast). Others argue that it was a mistake for the Jewish\nNational Fund to prohibit non-Jewish laborers from the newly purchased lands.\nHowever, even these revisionists agree that the Jews had not intended to evict\nMuslims from Palestine.\n\n            Israeli security officials believed that the murdered\nreal-estate dealer was executed by plainclothes Palestinian Authority\npolice. The Palestinian Authority's decision to make the sale of land to Jews a\ncapital crime reflects Palestinian frustration with Israeli land use,\nspecifically the creation of a new Jewish neighborhood now under\nconstruction in East Jerusalem.\n\n            In the past, death\nthreats have done little to deter sales of land. According to British land\nrecords, the Jerusalem mufti's 1934 decree failed to prevent sales. But that\ndecree did not have the power of civil law behind it. Nevertheless, the\nincentives to sell at the market price are substantial, and if the threats\ncreate new scarcities, higher prices will probably encourage sellers to unload\ntheir land.\n\n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "ArticleIP_1059", "class": "journal"}

Last week, the Senate rejected Majority Leader\nTom Daschle's bill banning the abortion of \"viable fetuses.\" But William\nBennett and William Safire hailed Daschle's bill as the great compromise that\nmight settle a quarter century of arguments about abortion. Forty-one states\nalready restrict the abortion of viable fetuses. What is a viable fetus? How is\nthe concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues of\nabortion?\n\n            \n               Roe\nvs. Wade , the 1973 case legalizing abortion, made fetal viability an\nimportant legal concept . The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot put\nthe interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the\nfetus is \"viable.\" The court defined viable to mean capable of prolonged life\noutside the mother's womb. It said this included fetuses that doctors expected\nto be sustained by respirators. The court accepted the conventional medical\nwisdom that a fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of a\npregnancy, the third trimester, sometime between the 24 th and\n28 th week (a pregnancy usually lasts 38 weeks). Because the point of\nviability varies, the court ruled, it could only be determined case by case and\nby the woman's own doctor. Even if the fetus is viable, the court said, states\ncould not outlaw an abortion if the woman's life or health was at stake.\n\n            Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued in a 1983 decision that\nRoe was on a \"collision course with itself.\" She said that\nimprovements in technology would continually push the point of fetal\nviability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy, allowing states greater\nopportunity to regulate the right to an abortion. And this seems to be the\ncase--up to a point. Doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the\n23 rd week--a week earlier than was thought 24 years ago. Most\nhospitals will only perform abortions through the 22 nd week of\npregnancy.\n\n            But no\nbaby has ever been successfully delivered before the middle of the\n22 nd week. Babies delivered during the 22 nd and\n23 rd weeks weigh just over a pound. Their lungs have barely\nformed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale. Circulation\ndepends on the use of ventilators and injections of hormones. A baby born\nduring the 22 nd week has a 14.8 percent chance of survival. And\nabout half of these survivors are brain-damaged, either by lack of oxygen (from\npoor initial respiration) or too much oxygen (from the ventilator).\nNeonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the\n22 nd week, because before then the lungs are not fully formed.\n\n            \nProbability of survival increases for babies\nborn later in pregnancy: 25 percent in the 23 rd week, 42 percent in\nthe 24 th week, 57 percent in 25 th week. By the\n30 th week, when a newborn doesn't require a ventilator to breathe,\nit has a 90 percent chance of survival. And only after the 30 th week\ndo the risks of long-term brain damage begin to substantially subside. Because\npremature babies depend on technology, survival rates vary based on access\nto that technology . For instance, in rural communities, which commonly lack\nexpensive infant intensive-care units, survival rates in these early weeks are\nmuch lower.\n\n            Doctors\nassess a fetus's viability by attempting to guess whether its lungs have\nformed. Sonograms allow doctors to estimate the fetus's weight, which\ncorrelates with the lungs' development, and to look for signs--such as the\ndevelopment of functioning eyelids and creases in the skin--that\ncoincide with the onset of a functioning respiratory system. None of the\nmethods for predicting viability are very precise.\n\n            Despite important Supreme Court decisions since 1973\nmodifying the doctrine of Roe , the court's thinking about fetal\nviability has remained fairly constant . The only significant revision\ncame in the Casey decision (1992), which made viability even more\nimportant. The court said that state laws could require a woman and her doctor\nto perform tests to prove that a fetus is not viable before she obtains an\nabortion.\n\n            Forty-one\nstates now have laws restricting post-viability abortions. Some allow doctors\nto decide for themselves if the fetus is viable. Some require doctors to\nperform tests to prove a fetus is pre-viable and require multiple doctors to\ncertify the findings. Eleven states have banned the procedure called intact\ndilation and extraction (IDE)--also known as partial-birth abortion --in\nthe belief that this procedure is used mainly post-viability.\n\n            \nBanning IDEs nationwide is a major goal of the\npro-life movement. Movement adherents claim that the IDE procedure--in which\ndelivery is induced, the fetus's skull is crushed, and its brains are\nsuctioned--amounts to infanticide. Barring this procedure is also the only\nregulation of abortion that public-opinion polls say has a majority of\nsupport. Pro-choicers say the ban on IDEs is inconsistent with Roe ,\nbecause the procedure can be used to abort pre-viable fetuses.\n\n            Some medical ethicists\nand constitutional scholars say that the Supreme Court was wrong to create\nthe pre-viability/post-viability distinction in the first place. Why, they ask,\ndoes the fact that a fetus can survive outside the womb with the help of vast\nmedical technology change either of the interests at war in the abortion\ndebate: the fetus's own claim to \"human-ness\" and a woman's right to control\nher body? Even if viability is an important moral line, is it drawn in the\nright place? Keeping alive a baby born in the 22 nd week costs\nseveral hundred thousand dollars and usually fails, regardless of the\neffort.\n\n            The fuss over post-viability\nabortions ultimately concerns only a very small number of procedures .\nLess than one percent of all abortions performed take place after the\n21 st week. In 1992, only 1,070 abortions were performed after the\n25 th week.\n\n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "ArticleIP_1060", "class": "journal"}

From a lifetime of undisciplined reading with\ninnocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind,\nI have gleaned a harvest of what I am pleased to denominate\nRed Pants items, a sampling of which follows.\nMy designation derives from a splash of vivid\nwriting in Francis Thompson's  A Corymbus for Autumn\nin which he proclaims how \u201cday's dying dragon\u201d\nwas\n\n\nPanting red pants into the West.\n            \n\n            In this trousers category, Thompson must share the\nlimelight with Coleridge by virtue of the line in Kubla\nKhan :\n\n\nAs if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing.\n            \n\n            Even Shelley may stake a claim, if only in the pajama\ndivision of this sector, thanks to his description in\nEpipsychidion of how\n\n\n... the slow, silent night\nIs measured by the pants of their calm sleep.\n            \n\n            Since everthing is to be found in Shakespeare, it is not\nsurprising that on at least two occasions the Board has\ncontributed his own Red Pants nuggets.  In Antony and\nCleopatra (Act IV, Scene VIII, lines 14 et seq .)  Antony\ncommands the wounded Scarus to\n\n\n... leap thou, attire and all,\nThrough proof of harness to my heart, and there\nRide on the pants triumphing.\n            \n\n            And in Othello (Act II, Scene I, line 80) Cassio utters\nthe fervent prayer that Othello might\n\n            Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms.\n\n            A variation on this theme occurs in Alba de C\u00e9spedes'\nThe Secret (translated from the Italian by Isabel\nQuigly: Simon and Schuster, New York, 1958, page\n114) where she confides that \u201cI still had a whole afternoon\nbefore me to spend, and I used it to tidy up my\ndrawers....\u201d  One may well wonder what Miss Stowe\nhad in mind when, in Uncle Tom's Cabin (Chapter 5),\nshe narrates how \u201cMrs. Shelby stood like one stricken.\nFinally, turning to her toilet, she rested her face in her\nhands, and gave a sort of groan.\u201d  In this same vein, the\nmirthless Milton adds his bit to the general hilarity of\nnations when, in describing Mount Etna in Book I of\nParadise Lost (lines 236-7) he penned\n\n\nAnd leave a singed bottom all involved\nWith stench and smoke: ...\n            \n\n            And in Chapter VI of Vanity Fair , when Blenkinsop,\nthe housekeeper, sought to console Amelia for Joe\nSedley's jilting of her dear Rebecca, Thackeray confides\n(indelicately?)  that Amelia wept confidentially on\nthe housekeeper's shoulder \u201cand relieved herself a good\ndeal.\u201d\n\n            Chuckles often emanate from the British employment\nof a term in a sense at variance with American\nusage.  There is that oft-quoted example, near the\nopening of Trial by Jury , where Defendant asks, \u201cIs\nthis the Court of the Exchequer?\u201d and having been\nassured that it was, Defendant (aside) commands himself\nto \u201cBe firm, be firm, my pecker.\u201d  The British, of\ncourse, do not giggle at this bit of Gilbertian dialogue,\nsince to them pecker means `courage,' as in the phrase\n\u201cto keep your pecker up.\u201d  Two of the more common\nexamples of British-American divergence of usage are\nscrew and knock up .  In Vanity Fair (Chapter 39), the\nniggardly Sir Pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat\nyour American sophomore might fancy him to be\nwhen he \u201cscrewed his tenants by letter.\u201d  He was simply\nmaking extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees.\nSimilarly, when in Chapter XXXIV of the same\nnovel, Mrs. Bute reminds her husband that \u201cYou'd have\nbeen screwed in goal, Bute, if I had not kept your\nmoney,\u201d she was not speaking of pleasures deferred.  In\nBleak House (Chapter XXVII) Grandfather\nSmallweed, referring to Mr. George, warns Mr.\nTulkinghorn that \u201cI have him periodically in a vice.  I'll\ntwist him, sir.  I'll screw him, sir.\u201d  In Kipling's The\nLight That Failed (Chapter XIII), Torpenhow urges\nDick to attend a party that night, \u201cWe shall be half\nscrewed before the morning,\u201d is his dismal sales pitch\nto Dick.\n\n            In Chapter VI of Vanity Fair , Thackeray reports\non Joe Sedley's drunken avowal to wed Becky Sharp the\nnext morning, even if he had to \u201cknock up the Archbishop\nof Canterbury at Lambeth,\u201d in order to have\nhim in readiness to perform the ceremony.  In Great\nExpectations (Chapter VI), we learn how \u201c... Mr.\nWhopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad\ntemper.\u201d  And who could blame him?\n\n            Many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from\nthe pure-minded use of a word that suggests unmentionable\nparts of the human body.  It does not take a\ntoo-wicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a\nlewd nature.  Who can, for instance, blame a youth\nwith but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing\nwhen he reads in Pater's Marius The Epicurean (Chapter\nV) a reference to Apuleius' The Golden Ass noting\nthat \u201call through the book, there is an unmistakably\nreal feeling for asses ...\u201d?  In Scott's The Bride of\nLammermoor (Chapter VII), one reads about a boy\n\u201ccudgelling an ass,\u201d and one goes back over the passage\nto reassure himself that it does not contain a typographical\nerror for \u201ccuddling.\u201d\n\n            One may be indulged a giggle even though he is\nsure that Isak Dinesen did not intend an impropriety\nwhen she recorded in Out of Africa (Part V, Chapter\n4) how \u201cFathima's big white cock came strutting up\nbefore me.\u201d  And one is certain that Kenneth Rexroth,\nin his American Poetry in the Twentieth Century\n(Herder and Herder, N.Y., 1971) did not intend to hint\nat closet biographical matter when, in Chapter I, he\nwrote that \u201cWhitman's poems are full of men doing\nthings together,\u201d or, later in the same chapter, when he\nreferred to \u201cWhitman's joyous workmen swinging their\ntools in the open air.\u201d  College freshman still read with\nflendish glee the first line in Canto I of Spenser's The\nFaerie Queene (and never mind the title!) that tells\nhow\n\n            A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine.\n\n            In his poem Mr Nixon (from Hugh Selwyn Mauberley ),\nEzra Pound's Mr. Nixon advises kindly\n\n            Don't kick against the pricks,\n\n            although the identities of the latter are not divulged.\n\n            One is entitled to speculate on what outrageous\nproposal the narrator had made in Proust's Remembrance\nof Things Past, Vol. 2\u2014Cities of the Plain\n(translated by C. K. Scott Moncrieff\u2014Modern Library,\nN.Y., 1934, Page 90) to cause the Duchess to say,\n\u201cApart from your balls, can't I be of any use to you?\u201d\nThere is a famous letter penned by Rupert Brooke to\nhis friend, Edward Marsh, from somewhere near Fiji\n(p. 463 of A Treasury of the World's Great Letters ,\nSimon and Schuster, N.Y., 1940) in which he relates\nhow he sends his native boy up a palm tree, where he\n\u201ccuts off a couple of vast nuts ...\u201d (macho victim not\ndisclosed).  In the first chapter of Uncle Tom's Cabin ,\nMiss Stowe offers a dialogue between Haley and Mr.\nShelby, part of which goes, \u201c `Well,' said Haley, after\nthey had both silently picked their nuts for a season,\n`what do you say?' \u201d  In Bleak House (Chapter XXIV)\nDickens may cause some readers to blush when he\nwrote of Mr. George's blush that \u201cHe reddened a little\nthrough his brown.\u201d\n\n            We must move ineluctably to a consideration of\nperfectly reputable words which, having acquired sexual\nconnotations, cause adolescent\u2014and often adult\u2014\nhilarity, even when read by a person of only mildly\nprurient mind.  In Forster's A Passage to India (Chapter\nXXXI) a vivid picture is created by the sentence\n\u201cTangles like this still interrupted their intercourse.\u201d\nPages later (Chapter XXXVII), it is acknowledged that\n\u201cHe, too, felt that this was their last free intercourse.\u201d\nApparently from then on, it was going to have to be\ncash or credit card only.  In The Bride of Lammermoor\n(Chapter V), we are informed that the heroine \u201cplaced\ncertain restrictions on their intercourse,\u201d a limitation\nthat might have been more usefully set in that same\nauthor's Rob Roy (Chapter VII) where we are told of\nthe chance that the narrator and Miss Vernon might be\n\u201cthrown into very close and frequent intercourse.\u201d\n\n            A variation of this theme is found in Robert\nBrowning's The Flight of the Duchess (Section V):\n\n\n\u2014Not he!  For in Paris they told the elf\nOur rough North land was the Land of Lays,\n            \n\n            even though it is generally acknowledged that Paris is\nn\u00famero uno in this area of human activity.\n\n            More picturesque are the references to erections.\nAn arresting one occurs in A Passage to India (Chapter\nXXI) in which Forster describes a small building as \u201ca\nflimsy and frivolous erection,\u201d while in The Mayor of\nCasterbridge (Chapter XVI) the Mayor himself \u201cbeheld\nthe unattractive exterior of Farfrae's erection.\u201d  A\nphrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader.\n\n            Consider Dickens' sharp image in Bleak House (Chapter\nLIV) when he describes how \u201cSir Leicester leans\nback in his chair, and breathlessly ejaculates.... \u201d\nOr, in Nicholas Nickleby (Chapter XLVII), where that\nadmirable novelist graphically portrays how old Arthur\nGride \u201cagain raised his hands, again chuckled,\nand again ejaculated.\u201d  And in his short tale, Lionizing ,\nEdgar Allan Poe is quite candid in describing the reaction\nof one of his characters: \u201c ` Admirable! ' he ejaculated,\nthrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the\nmanoeuvre.\u201d\n\n            Alas for perfectly lovely words that acquire pejorative\nmeanings over the years!  Earlier in this century,\npansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete\nmale, thereby cheapening forever lines like Shelley's\nnoble image in Adonais (verse XXXIII):\n\n\nHis head was bound with pansies over-blown,\n            \n\n            not to mention Poe's odd allusion in For Annie :\n\n\nWith rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies.\n            \n\n            Or, more slap-stickish, E.F. Benson's action picture in\nLucia in London (Chapter 8): \u201cGeorgie stepped on a\nbeautiful pansy.\u201d\n\n            Of more recent vintage is gay .  Nobody used to\nsnicker at Chaucer's line (No. 5818) in The Prologe of\nthe Wyf of Bathe , in which that harried dame asks:\n\n\nWhy is my neghebores wif so gay?\n            \n\n            In his poem The Menagerie , one of William\nVaughan Moody's characters advises:\n\n\nIf nature made you so graceful, don't get gay,\n            \n\n            while in Othello (ah, the Bard again!)  in his dialogue\nwith Desdemona and Emilia on the praise of women,\nIago refers to the kind that\n\n\nNever lack'd gold, and yet went never gay.\n\n(Act II, Scene I, line 150)\n            \n\n            And what in the world is one to make of William\nButler Yeats's startling revelation in his poem Lapis\nLazuli (from Last Poems ) that\n\n\nThey know that Hamlet and Lear are gay.?\n            \n\n            Indeed it is an amusing, albeit utterly wasteful\npastime to pursue the quest for Red Pants examples.\nMay good cess befall all such quixotically misguided\nreaders!  One caveat: never assume blithely that an odd\nword or suspicious phrase is as lubricious as it sounds.\nIn The Bride of Lammermoor (Chapter VI) Bucklaw\nvows, \u201cI will chop them off with my whinger,\u201d and one\nfeels quite let down when he learns that a whinger is\nbut a whinyard, which is merely a short sword.\n         \n         \n            \n\u201cTurning a corner of the Mazza Gallerie into a women's\ntennis store, I was startled to see ... hordes of giggling high\nschool girls ... \u201d [From an article by Dorothy Gilliam in\nthe Washington Post , .  Submitted by .]\n         \n         \n            LIGHT REFRACTIONS\n\n\n\n\n            If you are a fan of old-fashioned jazz\u2014what is now\nknown as \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201ctrad\u201d jazz\u2014you are familiar\nwith one of the standard \u201cjump tunes\u201d of the\ngenre\u2014a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble .\nEven if you are not a fan, you must have heard it\nas least a dozen times.  It is the one that goes, \u201cDah!\nDah!  Dah!  Dah!  da-dat-dat-dah!  Da-de-da-de-da-de-dat-dat-dah\n!  da-de-da-de-da-de-dat-dat-dah!\u201d\n\n\nThat's it; sure; you've heard it.\n            \n\n            I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble\nback in about 1940, when I was in my early teens.\nMy memory is rickety, but I am sure my first recording\nwas labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE, and I think, though I\nam less sure, that it was played by the late \u201cMuggsy\u201d\nSpanier, who was, to my mind, one of the greatest of\njazz trumpeters.  Later, I got another recording of the\nsame tune, this one by, I think, Mezz Mezzrow.  The\nlabel said, MUSKAT RAMBLE.  I thought that was surely\nthe first time I had ever seen such an obvious typographical\nerror in, of all things, a simple title on a\nsimple 78-rpm record.  (This, remember, was in my\nyouth, and it was a time when typographical errors\nwere called typographical errors, not typos\u2014at least\nby kids in junior high.)  Some time later, I got still\nanother version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE, with still another\nversion of the title.  This time, it was MUSCAT RAMBLE.\nThat, I thought, was really absurd.  Not only had they\nleft out the \u201cR\u201d; they'd changed the \u201cK\u201d to \u201cC\u201d.  Now, it\nmade no sense at all.  On the other hand, I reasoned, if\nthere were, in fact, some sort of cat called a muscat,\nperhaps it wasn't so outrageous.  I looked up muscat in\nmy Webster's and found that it is a `variety of grape.'\nTo name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to\nme preposterous.  I was young and, by today's standards,\nat least, pathetically innocent.\n\n            During my time in senior high, and, after that, in\nthe Army Air Force, I had other things on my mind\n(there was a war on, after all), and I didn't give\nthe MUSKRAT-MUSKAT-MUSCAT RAMBLE problem any\nthought.\n\n            Speaking of my time in the AAF, which was utterly\nundistinguished, I think I must make a confession.\nNow might be as good a time as any to reveal a\ntheft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour,\nIndiana.  It was winter and bitterly cold.  The wind\nused to sweep across that damned airfield with what\nseemed an absolute determination to crystallize our\nbodies.  One day when the wind chill factor was nearing\nabsolute zero, I took shelter in the service club.\nThere was the omnipresent phonograph, or Vic , short\nfor Victrola, and the stack of records next to it.  In\nthose days, people as a rule did not take much care of\nphonograph records.  Usually the records were taken\nfrom their jackets and loaded naked in stacks, where\nthey picked up dust, scratched one another, and\ntraded static electricity.  I was shuffling through a stack\nof about fifty records, and I came across three Bessie\nSmiths.  I played all three, and the few other G.I.s in\nthe room, which was quite large\u2014big enough for a\nfair-sized dance with a small orchestra\u2014either paid\nno attention or asked me to put on something by Glenn\nMiller or Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead.  Among\nBessie's numbers were Dying Gambler's Blues, Sing\nSing Prison Blues , and one I had never heard called\nBlack Mountain Blues , which has the imcomparable\nlines,\n\n\nHome in Black Mountain a chile' will smack yo'\nface;\n\nHome in Black Mountain a chile' will smack yo'\nface;\n\nBabies cry for liquor an' all the birds sing bass.\n            \n\n            and\n\n\nGoin' back to Black Mountain, me an' my razor\nan' my gun;\n\nGoin' back to Black Mountain, me an' my razor\nan my gun;\n\nGoin' cut him if he stan' still, goin' shoot him if he\nrun.\n            \n\n            I was, and still am, captivated by \u201cBabies cry for\nliquor an' the birds sing bass,\u201d and in the arrogance of\nmy youth, I was certain that nobody else on the airfield\neither knew or cared who Bessie Smith was, nor\nwould any other G.I. be enchanted by basso birds, so I\nturned thief.  I can't remember how I did it, but somehow\nI smuggled those records back to my barracks and\ngot them home intact on my next furlough.  I kept\nthem in good shape until my last 78-rpm turntable\ndied.\n\n            End of digression and back to MUSKRAT-KAT-CAT:\nMuskrat Ramble is credited to Edward \u201cKid\u201d Ory and\nRay Gilbert.  \u201cKid\u201d Ory played great jazz trombone.\nThe only thing I know about Gilbert is that I find him\nlisted as co-author of Muskrat Ramble .\n\n            About thirty years ago, when I was concocting an\nepicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand, I\nwent to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel\nthat was being sold for an absurdly low price and\nthat I thought might be exactly right for my sauce.  It\nwasn't bad, The wine jogged my thoughts back to\nMuscat Ramble .  Muscatel is made from muscat\ngrapes, is sometimes called muscat , and, being relatively\ncheap and sweet and high in alcohol content, is\nthe booze of choice for a great many wines.  An old\ncollege friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth\nbirthday\u2014meaning twenty years of AA sobriety\u2014a\ncouple of years ago, tells me that when he was on the\nskids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk\ntank, the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle\nand Napa Valley smoke .\n\n            I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble was\nalmost certainly the original name of the tune.  My\nreasoning is that it is not likely that \u201cKid\u201d Ory or Ray\nGilbert had ever seen a muskrat, and it's even less\nlikely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat\ndoing anything that we would be likely to think of as\nrambling.  Muskrats, according to my encyclopedia,\nlook like giant rats, are found in and around the\nmudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds, have\npartially webbed feet, and do a good deal of swimming.\nThey do not appear to do much rambling.  Muscat,\nor muscatel, on the other hand, is found on skid\nrows all over the land.  A guy with a bottle-shaped\nbrown paper bag, damp and wrinkled at its upper\nend, has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet\nwine of high proof, and the odds are pretty good you\nwould find it is a muscadoodle .  After the guy finishes\nhis Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off, he is looking\nfor the means to get another muscat fix.  Now he is on a\nramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his\nroadmapped eyes.  I suspect that that is precisely the\nsong's origin.\n\n            My theory is that the \u201cr\u201d got put in there simply\nbecause muskrat is a more common word than muscat .\nIt is the same reason most of us, I assume, have heard,\n\u201cHe's in the hospital with prostrate trouble.\u201d  Prostrate\nis a more common word that prostate , so prostrate is\nwhat we get.  The \u201cr\u201d fits in naturally.  I got a strange\nsort of corroboration from my good friend Rosy\nMcHargue, who is now pushing eighty-seven years and\nhas spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with\nsome of the best jazzbands\u2014Benny Goodman, Red\nNichols, Ted Weems, and a slew of others.  Rosy, too,\nhad seen the tune as Muskrat, Muskat , and Muscat .  I\nasked him what he thought the original title was.  He\nhad known \u201cKid\u201d Ory well, and he said, \u201cYou know,\nTom, I'm not exactly sure.  I once asked Ory about it\nand he said, `It's m-u-s-c-a-t.  Muskrat .'  So I think that's\njust the way everyone said muscat .\u201d\n\n            There you are.  I find a muskrat ramble difficult to\nimagine visually.  I picture muskrats wallowing about\nin the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water,\nbut I wouldn't call that rambling.  On the other hand,\na wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain\nhis muscat level\u2014now that has a touch of poetry.\nMaybe not in the same class with \u201call the birds sing\nbass,\u201d but poetry, nevertheless.\n         \n         \n\n            As a nonexpert, although interested, subscriber to\nVERBATIM, it is \u201ca bit mysterious\u201d to me that the singular\nnoun absence takes the plural verb are .  I refer to\nthe first sentence of your article about the Longman\nDictionary [XV,1].\n\n\n\n         \n         \n\n            Helen W. Power, in \u201cWomen on Language;\nWomen in Language,\u201d [XV,2] may bewail the insensitivity\nof the male.  But she betrays her own elitist insensitivity\nwhen she describes a flight attendant as \u201cthe\nperson who passes peanuts on an airplane.\u201d  I hope\nMs./Miss/Mrs. Power never needs to draw on the considerable\nfirst-aid and emergency training that every\nattendant must master.\n\n\n\n         \n         \n            Antipodean Newsletter\n\n\n\n            Leonard Bloomfield, having begun with a theory\nof meaning which emphasized the environment in\nwhich objects were present and named, had to add the\nobvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is\nnot present.  I have lately been reading accounts of the\nexploration of the western and northwestern deserts of\nAustralia in the 1870s and I have become very aware of\nthe effect absent necessities might have on the frequency\nof particular items in discourse.  In the desert\nthe missing necessity is water.  As the explorer Ernest\nGiles put it, the explorer's experience is a \u201cbaptism\nworse than that of fire\u2014the baptism of no water.\u201d\n\n            My impression was that in the journals of desert\nexplorers the word water , alone or in compounds, and\nwords relating to water, were unusually frequent.  It is,\nI suppose, likely that people with little money must\nthink of money more than the well-off do and that the\nhungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty\non drink.  Here was a chance to quantify such things.  I\ndecided to make a count of words relating to water in\nreports of desert exploration.\n\n            Taking quite at random a single page (page 7) in\nthe journals of the Gregory brothers recording an early\n(1846) exploration of country east and north of Perth, I\nfind the word water used fifteen times.  Ten pages on\n(page 17), water occurs nine times but there are also\nthe related words stream (twice), well (twice), pool,\nchannel , and the circumlocution \u201cessential element.\u201d\nTwo words, dew and shower , refer in the context to the\npresence of water; the rest are in contexts indicating its\nabsence.\n\n            I tried another explorer, Ernest Giles.  Taking\npage 17 again, I was reminded that Giles is rather\ngiven to semi-serious poetic diction at times, and we\nfind him referring to the presence of water in the Finke\nRiver as \u201cthe stream purling over its stony floor\u201d or,\nquoting some bygone poet, \u201cbrightly the brook through\nthe green leaflets, giddy with joyousness, dances\nalong.\u201d  Perhaps present water called for some stylistic\ncelebration.  Two hundred pages further on there is less\nexuberance in the circumlocution \u201cthat fluid so terribly\nscarce in the region,\u201d and in three other references\nwater is simply water .  Giles is not always waxing poetic\nand may, like other explorers, be useful as a source\nfor the history of Australian and general English.  His\nuse of the word tank to refer to a hollowed-out reservoir\n(\u201cGibson dug a small tank and the water soon\ncleared\u201d) antedates the OED , for instance.\n\n            Since this linguistic-statistical study of an obsession\nmight well prove to be an important contribution\nto psycholinguistics, I decided to make a larger sample\nof watery words, choosing the straightforward journals\nof Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton, who led an expedition\nacross the western interior of Australia in\n1873-4.  In a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages\n(151-60 of the published journal) there were twenty-eight\noccurrences of the word water (eight of them in\ncompounds), no page being without at least one example.\nIn addition, there was a rich collection of words\nrelating to water, not necessarily indicating its presence.\n\u201cHoping to find a lake\u201d is included, though of\ncourse it doesn't indicate the presence of water.  Even\nwords which are usually of more general reference are\nbrought into relation with water in a text like this.\nGum-trees or rocks (in areas of sand) appear as signs of\npossible water.  Apart from these words and lake ,\nwords and phrases directly associated with thoughts of\nwater and reinforcing the sense of obsession include\npool, springs, drainage hole, clay hole, flood, channel,\nwater-courses, water-hole, rock-hole, drink, drinkable,\nrunning water, stream , and native well .\n\n            The last two items merit comment.  Stream is often\nsaid not to be used in Australia except in metaphorical\nways, normally being replaced by creek .\nWarburton's use: \u201csandbanks intercept the stream,\nwhich finally splits into narow water-courses and\nspreads itself over the plains, and so it ends as a creek\u201d\nsuggests a somewhat more complex relation between\nthe two words.  British-born explorers did not set out to\nwrite Australian English, of course.  Gregory uses\nstream in the way normal in England; Giles consistently\nrefers to gens in the hills of central Australia,\nthough glen is not current (outside place-names) in\ncontemporary Australian English.\n\n            The other name, native well is, as a later explorer\nDavid Carnegie, author of Spinifex and Sand (1898),\npoints out, a misnomer.  He believes native wells are\nessentially rock-holes (depressions in rock) buried in\nfairly shallow sand, which, when hollowed out by the\nnatives, appear to be wells.  This sort of misnomer\nleads Carnegie to suppose that \u201cto the uninitiated no\nmap is so misleading as that of West Australia where\nlakes are salt-bogs without surface water, springs seldom\nrun, and native `wells' are merely tiny holes in the\nrock, yielding from 0 to 200 gallons.\u201d\n\n            Carnegie also describes namma-holes and soaks as\nsources of water.  Soaks are shallow wells sunk near the\nbase of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir.\nNamma-holes have been variously described; to Carnegie\nthey are depressions on the surface of rocks, often\nwith a rounded bottom, where stones are often found,\nsuggesting that the stones have something to do with\nthe formation of the holes.\n\n            Some nostalgic early Australians deplored the loss\nin our speech of English country words, the glens and\nstreams (alive, anyway, in the journals of explorers),\ncoppices and brooks, woods, becks , and rivulets .  Perhaps\nthese words did not really fit.  We might have\ndone better with Arabic-speaking settlers.  Wadi , for\ninstance, would describe an inland creek rather well.\nBe that as it may, a later Australian visitor to English\ndrizzle might feel nostalgic when thinking of the\nparched and thirsty but water-obsessed vocabulary developed\nin the drier areas of our sunburnt land.\n         \n         \n            Favorite Grammatical Game: Puzzling Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n            Here is a game just made to while away the hours\non a commuter train with your favorite author,\na perfect place to hunt for Puzzling Pronouns .\n\n            \n               Fowler lists five instances where a careless writer\ncan go wrong.  There is really no excuse, Fowler says\n(not he says!), but here we give examples of his third\ncase only, where \u201cthere should not be two parties justifying\neven a momentary doubt about which the pronoun\nrepresents.\u201d  And here the deluge of printed matter\nabounds with such specimens that one would\nsuppose them to be the rule rather than the exceptions.\nIt is a game that is like fishing in a barrel, but more\nstimulating mentally.  I am not picking on the following\nauthors; it is just a random catch.\n\n            In Thomas Hardy's The Hand of Ethelberta , it is\nsuggested by Ethelberta that she and some others go to\nsee Milton's tomb in Cripplegate church.  Her suitor,\nNeigh, who had proposed marriage in a previous\nchapter, appears somewhat apprehensive at Ethelberta's\nsuggestion.  This apprehension is observed by a\nMr. Belmaine and mistaken by him for an indication\nthat Neigh has been dragged into going to the church\nagainst his will \u201cby his over-hasty wife.\u201d  One wonders\nwhether the marriage had secretly taken place between\nthe consecutive chapters!  You see, it is\nBelmaine's wife who was doing the dragging.\n\n            Somerset Maugham was a good and careful grammarian\nbut now and then he slipped.

Quiet now.\nLights, action:\n\n\nI was asleep, but Luigi was awake, and he thought\nhe detected a vague form nearing the bed.  He\nslipped the knife out of the sheath and was ready,\nand unembarrassed by hampering bedclothes, for\nthe weather was hot and we hadn't any.  Suddenly\nthat native rose at the bedside, and bent over me\nwith his right hand lifted and a dirk in it aimed at\nmy throat; but Luigi grabbed his wrist, pulled him\ndownward, and drove his own knife into the man's\nneck.  That is the whole story.\n            \n\n            Well, was it Luigi's knife or the native's?

In a figurative way, Yiddish\nis the wise and humble language of us all, the idiom\nof a frightened and hopeful humanity.\n            \n\n            The word Yiddish derives from the German\njudisch `Jewish.'  The principal parent of Yiddish is\nHigh German, the form of German encountered by\nJewish settlers from northern France in the eleventh\ncentury.  Yiddish is written in the characters of the\nHebrew alphabet and from right to left and enjoys\nborrowing words from Russian, Polish, English, and\nall the other languages and countries along the routes\nthat Jews have traveled during the past thousand years.\nJournalist Charles Rappaport once quipped, \u201cI speak\nten languages\u2014all of them Yiddish.\u201d\n\n            Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out\nfor hundreds of years, the language is spoken today by\nmillions of people throughout the world\u2014Russia, Poland,\nRumania, France, England, Israel, Africa,\nLatin America, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and\nthe United States, where, like the bagel, it was leavened\non both coasts, in New York and Hollywood.  It is\nspoken even in Transylvania: A beautiful girl awakens\nin bed to find a vampire at her side.  Quickly she holds\nup a cross. \u201cZie gernisht helfen,\u201d smiles the vampire.\nTranslation: \u201cIt won't do you any good.\u201d\n\n            Most of us already speak a fair amount of Yiddish\n(Yinglish) without fully realizing it.  Webster's Third\nNew International Dictionary lists about 500 Yiddish\nwords that have become part of our everyday conversations,\nincluding:\n\n\ncockamamy (or cockamamie) `mixed-up, ridiculous.'\n\nfin slang for `five-dollar bill,' from finf, the Yiddish\nword for `five.'\n\ngun moll a double clipping of gonif's Molly, Yiddish\nfor `thief's girl.'\n\nkibitzer `one who comments, often in the form of\nunwanted advice, during a game, often cards.'\n\nmavin `expert.'\n\nmazuma `money.'\n\nmish-mosh `mess.'\n\nschlep to `drag or haul.'\n\nschlock `shoddy, cheaply produced merchandise.'\n\nschmeer the `entire deal,' the `whole package.'\n\nschnoz slang for `nose.'\n\nyenta `blabbermouth, gossip; woman of low\norigins.'\n            \n\n            ... and so on through the whole megillah : `long,\ninvolved story.'\n\n            A number of poignant Yiddish words defy genuine\ntranslation into English:\n\n\nchutzpa `nerve; unmitigated gall;' a quality we\nadmire within ourselves, but never in others.  In\nhis delightful study, The Joys of Yiddish (McGraw-Hill\n1968), Leo Rosten offers two classic\ndefinitions.  \u201cChutzpa is that quality enshrined in\na man, who, having killed his mother and father,\nthrows himself on the mercy of the court because\nhe is an orphan.  A chutzpanik may be defined as\nthe man who shouts `Help!  Help!'  while beating\nyou up.\u201d\n\nmensch a `real authentic human being\u2014a person.'\nnaches the `glow of pleasure-plus-pride that only\na child can give to its parents': \u201cThis is my son,\nthe Doctor!\u201d\n\noy not so much a word as an entire vocabulary, as\nRosten observes: \u201ccan express any emotion, from\ntrivial delight to the blackest woe.\u201d\n\noy vay; oy vay in mir literally, \u201cOh, pain,\u201d but, in\nits long or short form, can be used for anything\nfrom condolence to lament:\n\nOn August 6, 1945, the world's first nuclear\nweapon was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.  Two\nhundred and eighty-two thousand human beings\ndied and tens of thousands more were left\nburned, maimed, and homeless.  [Albert] Einstein,\nwhose letter to Roosevelt had initiated the\nAmerican effort that resulted in the atom bomb\nand whose special theory of relativity formed its\ntheoretical basis, heard the news on the radio.\nFor a long time he could only find two Yiddish\nwords traditionally used by Jews in such circumstances:\n\u201cOi vey.\u201d\n\n\u2014The Little, Brown Book of Anecdotes\n\ntsuris the gamut of painful emotions\u2014some real,\nsome imagined, some self-inflicted.\n            \n\n            Yiddish is especially versatile in describing those\npoor souls who inhabit the world of the ineffectual,\nand each is assigned a distinct place in the gallery of\npathetic types: schmo, schmendrik, schnook, schmegegge,\nschlep, schlub, schmuck, putz, klutz, kvetch ,\nand nudnik .  Yiddish easily coins new names for new\npersonalities: a nudnik is a `pest'; a phudnik is a `nudnik\nwith a Ph.D.'  The rich nuances that suffuse this\nroll call are seen in the timeless distinction between a\nschlemiel `clumsy jerk' and a schlimazel `habitual\nloser': the schlemiel inevitably trips and spills his hot\nsoup\u2014all over the schlimazel.  (And the nebbish is the\none who has to clean it up.)\n\n            The Yiddish language, through its color, its target-accurate\nexpressions, its raw idioms, and its sayings\nexudes a refreshing magic and laughter, mixed with\nsober thought, that has been handed down from generation\nto generation and from nation to nation.  Yiddish\nnever apologizes for what it is\u2014the earthy, wise\nsoul of an expressive people learning that life is but a\nmingled yarn, good and ill together.\n\n            Which reminds us of the zaftig `buxom, well-rounded'\nblonde who wore an enormous diamond to a\ncharity ball.  \u201cIt happens to be the third most famous\ndiamond in the whole world,\u201d she boasted.  \u201cThe first is\nthe Hope diamond, then comes the Kohinoor, and then\ncomes this one, which is called the Lipschitz.\u201d\n\n            \u201cWhat a stone!  How lucky you are!\u201d\n\n            \u201cWait, wait,\u201d said the lady.  \u201cNothing in life is all\nmazel [`good luck'].  Unfortunately, with this famous\nLipschitz diamond comes also the famous Lipschitz\ncurse.\u201d\n\n            The other women gasped and asked, \u201cAnd what is\nthe famous Lipschitz curse?\u201d\n\n            \u201cLipschitz,\u201d sighed the lady.\n         \n         \n            The Women's History of the Word\n            Those who are not familiar with feminist writings\nmay find it useful and interesting to consider a book,\nrecently published in Britain, that is typical of the\nharsher brand of such works.  The work in question\noffers nothing regarding language, so its review here is\nancillary to the main function of VERBATIM.  The feminist\nmovement is very much alive in Britain, and the\n\u201cGreenham Common Women\u201d are probably largely\nresponsible for much of the national sentiment against\nthe Cruise missiles installed at an American base near\nthat village.  In Britain, as elsewhere, most books by\nfeminist writers are reviewed by women, usually feminists.\nMen are seldom assigned to review them, possibly\nbecause the editor fears that they will be either\nignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised, if not\nbiased against them, or because the editor is a woman.\nBecause writing an unfavorable review of a (bad) feminist\nbook would be tantamount to treachery, such\nbooks are often unjustifiably praised, as was the case\nwith this work by Rosalind Miles, which was well received\non its publication in June.\n\n            According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this\ndistinctly unpleasant book, Rosalind Miles is head of\nthe Centre for Women's Studies at Coventry Polytechnic,\na lecturer, broadcaster, journalist, and author of\nseveral other books, including a \u201chighly acclaimed\u201d\nbiography of Ben Jonson.  One might like to believe\nthat this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship,\nbut the text does not bear out the promise.\n\n            For the most part, the book consists of a rewriting\nof history, from the dawn of time, with the purpose of\ndemonstrating two main themes: the \u201cfact\u201d that\nwomen were responsible for all the important contributions\nto the advancement of civilization (as the development\nof agriculture, for instance), often despite\nthe arrogance and stupidity of men; and the \u201cfact\u201d\nthat women have long been subjected to domination\nby men.  Miles suggests that such domination is a recent\nphenomenon\u2014only a couple of thousand years\nold\u2014for she points to the clear superiority of women\nin (primitive) religions and matriarchies, right on\nthrough to the Egyptian dynastic rulers.  At one point,\nshe gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests\nthat females were responsible not only for all of\nhuman evolutionary biology but for the very notion of\ncounting (in order to keep track of menstruation) and,\nprobably by the same token, astronomy.  She quotes\n(and, presumably, accepts) another source which holds\nthat \u201cwoman first awakened in humankind the capacity\nto recognize abstracts.\u201d  If you believe that balderdash,\nyou'll believe anything.\n\n            In the good old days, we were taught that the\npyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves.\nRecent speculation has it that they were not slaves\nbut\u2014what would one call them? \u2014 ordinary laborers.\nHere comes Miles, authoritatively quoting Diodorus,\nthe Greek historian, who recorded (60-30BC) that \u201cinnocent\nwomen even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves\nwhose forced labour built the pyramids:\n\n\n... bound in fetters, they work continually\nwithout being allowed any rest by night or day.\nThey have not a rag to cover their nakedness, and\nneither the weakness of age nor women's infirmities\nare any plea to excuse them, but they are driven by\nblows until they drop dead.\u201d  [p.49]\n            \n\n            As the pyramids were already about 2500 years old\nwhen Diodorus wrote his World History , one is given\nto wonder what his authority might have been for such\na vivid description.  It is even less comprehensible how\na modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery\nto promulgate it.  Miles's book is riddled with\nmany similar distortions, convenient omissions, and\ngeneralizations:\n\n\n... Women have always commanded over half\nthe sum total of human intelligence and creativity.\nFrom the poet Sappho, who in the sixth century BC\nwas the first to use the lyric to write subjectively\nand explore the range of female experience, to the\nChinese polymath Pan Chao (Ban Zhao), who\nflourished around AD 100 as historian, poet, astronomer,\nmathematician and educationalist, the range\nis startling.  In every field, women too numerous to\nlist were involved in developing knowledge and\ncontributing to the welfare of their societies as they\ndid so: the Roman Fabiola established a hospital\nwhere she worked both as nurse and doctor, becoming\nthe first known woman surgeon before she\ndied in AD 399.  [p.52]\n            \n\n            Earlier, on page 49, we learnt about Agnodice, \u201cwho\nlived to become the world's first known woman gynaecologist,\u201d\nin the fourth century BC.  Clearly, this rosily\ncheckered past was soon to be replaced, chiefly, it\nseems, as Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Confucian-Buddhist\ncultures flourished.  It was not too bad early on,\nwhen, according to Miles, the seven Maccabean martyrs\nwho \u201csaved Judaism\u201d did so only at the instigation\nof their mother.  Miles continues:\n\n\nIn early Christianity likewise, women found not\nmerely a role, but an instrument of resistance to\nmale domination; in choosing to be a bride of\nChrist they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male\nfry.  Thousands of young women helped to build\nthe church of God with their body, blood and\nbones when frenzied fathers, husbands or fianc\u00e9s\npreferred to see them die by fire, sword or the\nfangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout [sic]\nthe duty and destiny of womanhood.  [p.63]\n            \n\n            But the situation soon deteriorated:\n\n\nEven St. Paul, later the unregenerate prophet of\nfemale inferiority, was forced to acknowledge the\nhelp he received from Lydia, the seller of purple\ndyes in Philippi.  [ibid.]\n            \n\n            This rewriting of history is punctuated by an array\nof four-letter invectives applied to males and by\nadjectives like brilliant, unusual, inspiring , and so\nforth to women.  Citing a Judaic law-book of the 16th\ncentury which identified a woman for the days preceding,\nduring, and following her period as niddah\n`impure,' Miles has the lack of taste to write the following:.\n\n\nAs a final stroke, in a grim foreshadowing of\nwhat the future held in store for the Jews, the niddah\nhad to wear special clothing as a badge of her\nseparate and despised status.  [p.83]\n            \n\n            Here and there in this morass of misunderstanding,\nMiles treads on solid ground if one can agree with\nthe eminent anthropologist Joseph Campbell.  Campbell,\nknown for his extensive analyses of the world's\nmythologies, religions, and cultures, noted the marked\nbias against women emerging from Judaic concepts,\nlater reinforced by Christian and Islamic doctrine.\nMost of the religions of the world connected woman\nwith mother earth, fertility, and all the other\nprogenetic and nurturing associations, and this was\nborne out in the cultures of the people.  According to\nCampbell, the only godlike female figure in the Bible\nis the Virgin Mary, and she appears, identified as virgin,\nonly in the Gospel according to Luke.  As Luke was\na Greek, Campbell suggested that Mary was a carryover\nfrom the paganism of the ancient Greek pantheon.\nAlthough this might help explain the Judeo-Christian-Muslim\ntendencies to subjugate women,\ntreating them essentially as chattel, it does not account\nfor a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures,\nnotably that of Japan.  It is not entirely clear\nwhether Campbell was commenting on Hinduism,\nBuddhism, etc. as they once existed, conceptually, for\nit is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment\nof women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering\nto those religous precepts.\n\n            Campbell held that the ancient mythologies and\nreligions are allegorical and that there was no real\ndistinction between gods and goddesses, who were\ngiven sexual identity when in human form only to\nmake them more meaningful.  With all respect, that\nseems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex\nfor this discussion, though we can certainly trace a\ndiminution in the role of female divinities (or divinity)\nwhen we come to examine Judaism and its congeners\nand progeny.  Other debatable aspects are the questions\nof whether the debasement of women is a reflection of\nthe theology or the ritual, whether the scripture of any\nreligion should be understood allegorically or literally,\nand so forth.  If there is something wrong, it behooves\nus to get at the roots of the problem, not to flail about\nwildly, for only after the source of a disease has been\nidentified can one properly investigate its cure.\n\n            \u201cHistory according to Rosalind Miles\u201d blasts away\nat the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating\nthem will effect a cure of the disease.  In this\njeremiad, males are viewed as the \u201cenemy,\u201d and are so\ncharacterized throughout the book, which concludes\nwith exhortations to engage the foe and a strident call\nto arms (though not men's).\n\n            Laurence Urdang\n         \n         \n            Archaeology & Language\n\n            [A VERBATIM Book Club Selection.]\n\n            Just when you thought it was safe to assume that\nwe now know all we are ever likely to know about the\npast, someone digs another hole and unearths (literally\nor figuratively) some ancient artifact: one day it is a\nfragile scroll, found in a cave near the Dead Sea, that\nturns out to be pre-Biblical; the next day it is an entire\nterracotta army of Chinese soldiers: the next it is a\nskull, excavated from the Olduvai Gorge, that compels\nanthropologists (once again) to revise their guesses\nabout the earliest stages of Homo sapiens sapiens vs\nhominids.  Most of the relies from the past are gone\nforever, destroyed by the plows of countless generations\nof farmers, reduced to rubble by erosion, by conquerors,\nby prehistoric (and modern) urban developers, by\nfire and flood, and just by time.  Many, we may hope,\nhave not yet been found.  The interest in man's forebears\ndid not become fashionable upon the publication,\na few years ago, of Roots : on a far larger scale,\nwe have been trying to discover all we can about the\norigins not of men but of man.  Strange to say, however,\nthat interest does not seem to be more than a few\nhundred years old: if the ancient Greeks and Romans,\nthe Indians, the Chinese and other peoples were curious\nabout their own prehistory, I have not heard of it.\nPerhaps the fascination with man's past grew out of\nthe obsession with ruins evinced by Romanticism; certainly,\nmodern archaeology seems to have followed\nclose behind, for the excavation of the supposed site of\nTroy took place only about 100 years ago.  Perhaps it is\njust as well, for only by the means available to modern\nscience are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts\nthat we find and, through radiocarbon dating,\ndetermine their approximate age.\n\n            Archaeology is a popular pursuit, and its manifest\nresults not only receive considerable publicity but can\nbe seen in museums.  Not so paleolinguistics, or the\nreconstruction of ancient languages.  Even the remnants\nwe have from early languages that had a writing\nsystem are relatively sparse: Classical Latin and\nGreek, Hebrew, and a few other languages are better\ndocumented than others; but for most all we have to go\non are a handful of tablets here, a few inscriptions\nthere, barely enough in many cases to allow us to\nidentify the language, let alone draw any conclusions\nregarding its structure or meaning.  Perhaps one day\nwe shall find an Etruscan library, buried deep in the\nItalian countryside; but for the present, we have to\nmake do with what we have, which is precious little.\nAbout languages that had no writing system, we know\nnothing at all.  But some very clever comparative linguists,\nbeginning in Germany in the 19th century, theorized\nabout how the nature of the ancestors of the\nmore modern tongues.  In some instances, ancient languages\nhave been decoded, some from multilingual\ninscriptions.  The work of Jean Francois Champollion\n(1790-1832) in deciphering hieroglyphics from the Rosetta\nStone was an astonishing accomplishment, for it\nenabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient\nEgyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and\nrevealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we\nhave today about their civilization, which lasted for\nabout 2600 years.  Another significant break-through\nwas that of Michael Ventris (1922-1956), who deciphered\nthe Linear B script found on Crete and identified\nit as an early form of Greek.  From the standpoint\nof language, Ventris's work was more important, particularly\nbecause it filled in a gap in our knowledge of\nthe early states of Indo-European languages.\n\n            Many years ago, a linguistic scholar counted all of\nthe languages then spoken of which he had evidence.\nThe total was approximately 2800, but that is probably\nonly a vague estimate: he undoubtedly missed\nsome; some have sprung up since his time (modern\nHebrew, for instance); and some have vanished.  The\nexact count is unimportant and, at best, spurious, for\nit is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for\nwhat distinguishes dialect from language.  Then, too,\none must examine the techniques used to group the\nmany languages of the world.\n\n            Linguists examining Classical Greek, Latin, German,\nEnglish, Slavic, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish,\nDutch, Lithuanian, Iranian, Hindi, and the other languages\nof India and Europe found that there were\ncorrespondences among many of the common words.\nSome, like French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese,\nhad more in common with one another than they did\nwith, say, German, English, Swedish, Danish, and\nDutch, which, in turn, bore only a remote resemblance\nto Russian and Polish, on the one hand, and the\ntwo extant varieties of, say, Gaelic, on the other.  One\nrapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers\nand toes, for after years of laboriously categorizing\nthese languages, the number of different main\nbranches (called families and subfamilies) came to\nabout ten.  Ingeniously, certain differences between\nfamilies were explained by various phonetic shifts that\n(inexplicably) took place in one language group but\nnot in another.  Although certain other languages were\ngeographically nearby, it was impossible to establish\nany resemblances between them, hence Basque, for\nexample, is not classified as being in the same family\nwith other European languages, nor are Hungarian\nand Finnish, both of which belong to their own group.\nAt the conclusion of this vast exercise, done without\nthe aid of computers, there emerged a pattern of familial\nrelationships that linked together languages spoken,\nin earlier times, from Britain as far east as Chinese\nTurkestan and from India as far north as\nLappland.  Charts showing the chief languages and\ntheir derivations can be found in many dictionaries\u2014inside\nthe front cover of The Random House Unabridged ,\nfor example.  Because linguists are constantly\nlearning more and more about the relationships\namong languages, it is best to avoid using an older\nchart; for the same reason, it would be wise not to\nstake too much on the accuracy of even a current\nchart.\n\n            The languages discussed here are what are usually\ncalled the Indo-European family; similar family trees\ncould be drawn for the Semitic languages, Sino-Tibetan,\nJapanese, Bantu, Malayo-Polynesian, and so on.\nEach is a distinct phylum; although there may be\nword-borrowing among them, lexicon is considered\nless important in the classification of languages than\nstructure and grammar.  It is important, too, to note\nthat writing systems are irrelevant: for instance, Polish\nis written (today) using the Roman alphabet, but Russian,\na related Slavic language, uses the Cyrillic; Yiddish,\na Germanic language, is written in Hebrew characters;\nLatin, Greek, and Sanskrit, which resemble\none another rather closely in some respects, all use\ndifferent alphabets; and early examples, utterly unrecognizable\nto untrained readers of modern languages,\nwere written in cuneiform, quite suitable for writing\non soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus, and hieroglyphics.\n\n            \nIt would be nice to think that while linguists were\nworking so hard to organize languages, they were\nworking alongside the archaeologists who were providing\nthe raw materials.  But only rarely did they collaborate\nand, with few exceptions, their work was not\ncorrelated in a systematic way.  Schliemann, who discovered\nthe site of Troy, used the evidence in Homer's\nIliad to determine his digging site, where any ruins\nhad long since disappeared from view.  In many other\nplaces, the ancient sites lay buried\u2014and still\ndo\u2014beneath modern cities: modern property owners\nquite understandably take a dim view of tearing down\ntheir buildings on the off chance that the remnants of\nan ancient town will be found several yards below.\ntoday, before a new building is erected in London, an\narchaeological team examines the cleared site for its\narchaeological significance.  But there, as everywhere\nelse, nothing can interfere with progress and, regardless\nof the finds and their importance, the archaeologist\nmust eventually yield to the bulldozer.  Notwithstanding,\neven the brief glimpses afforded by such\ninvestigations can provide some insight into civilizations\nthat existed hundreds or, in some cases, thousands\nof years earlier.\n\n            Based on the sparse evidence available, linguists\ntheorized about the earlier languages that had given\nrise to those attested.  In other words, based on what\nthey knew about a group of languages which were\ndocumented, they tried to imagine the language that\nthey sprang from.  In most cases, they dealt with words\nand functional elements, creating what are called reconstructions\nin hypothetical family prototypes called,\nvariously, Proto-Latin, Proto-Greek, Proto-Germanic,\nProto-Indo-Iranian, and so forth, the ultimate goal\nbeing to posit a single language called Proto-Indo-European.\nThat is not entirely true, for linguists know\ntoo much about language to suggest that there ever\nwas, literally, a single language from which all Indo-European\nlanguages descended.  Nonetheless, it is convenient\nto think about the existence of a group of\nproto-dialects which can be referred to as Proto-Indo-European.\n\n            \nIt seems only natural that once an original language,\nor Ursprache , was posited, the next step was to\nspeculate on its source, or Urheimat .  That is what\nRenfrew has tried to do.  Essentially, he proposes that\nthe parent of all Indo-European languages was itself\nborn in central Anatolia, whence it spread eastward,\nwestward, and northward, being modified by the influences\nof the languages with which it came into contact,\ntill it ultimately emerged in its recognizable,\nmodern manifestations which we categorize into Germanic,\nHellenic, Italic, Indo-Iranian, Anatolian, Armenian,\nCeltic, Tocharian, Albanian, and BaltoSlavic.\n\n            I have no quarrel with Renfrew's theory\u2014notwithstanding\nthe generally received wisdom that has\nplaced the homeland north of the Black Sea region\nand the Volga steppes.  It is difficult for the nonspecialist\nreader (like me) to assess the validity of his arguments,\nwhich are based on his contention that the\nlanguage (and its congeners) were carried along by the\nspread of nomad pastoralism.  Using the evidence available,\nRenfrew contends that the original Indo-European\nlanguage, closely related to Hittite, separated\nafter 6500 BC, with the IE languages of western Europe\ndeveloping from western Anatolia and those of\nIran, India, and Pakistan from the eastern division.\nThe choice between the prevailing theory and Renfrew's\ndepends on whether one accepts a \u201cwave\u201d theory,\nfirst promulgated more than a hundred years ago\nby Johnanes Schmidt, a German linguist, or one of\nindigenous development.  Pottery finds can be interpreted\nto support either the imposition of an elite culture\nfrom Turkmenia or a late development of the\nIndus civilization.  Renfrew accepts the wave theory,\nand in the last two thirds of Archaeology & Language\nhe sets forth his arguments in its favor.  Unfortunately,\nthe presentation of his linguistic argument, where the\nauthor is clearly treading on more speculative ground\nthan in those parts dealing with outright archaeology,\nwhere he is on more familiar territory, is disorganized\nand repetitious.  It is difficult to place all the blame on\nRenfrew, for his editor should have noticed the lack of\ncoherence.  The result is an argument that is persuasive\nbut scarely convincing.\n\n            Nevertheless, good books on archaeology assimilable\nby laymen are not easy to find, and if the reader\ncan tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned\nabout the precise birthplace of Indo-European,\nArchaelogy & Language provides an interesting march\nthrough the millennia of prehistory in seven-league\nboots.\n\n            Laurence Urdang\n         \n         \n            Webster's Electronic Thesaurus\n            This software consists of two disks, one labeled\nInstallation and Program, the other Synonym Linguibase,\nand a manual.  The manual sets forth everything\nwith clarity, and the program is simple to install, requiring\nonly a few minutes.  Only one thing made me a\nlittle suspicious when cranking up the system: in the\ndescriptive text that appears on the screen, the word\nlabeled is spelt \u201clabelled\u201d\u2014decidedly un-American.\nHowever, I went ahead, and, since I was typing the\ntext you are reading, returned to the beginning of the\nparagraph to see how some of these words would fare.\nI looked up the word preceding and was, after a brief\nmoment, asked to type in the word, which I did.  The\nscreen bloomed forth with the following:\n\n            Query: preceding\n\n            1)  adj being before especially in time or arrangement\n\n            There were also some other parts of speech: one\ndefinition for the preposition and three for the verb\n(participial) senses.  I called up the synonyms for the\nadj and the following appeared:\n\n            Synonyms:\n\n\nantecedent, anterior, foregoing, former, past, precedent,\nprevious, prior\n            \n\n            The way the program works is this: one uses the cursor\nto highlight a particular word for which synonyms are\ndesired.  It is similar, in principle, to finding a synonym\nin a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonyms\nto find them.  I am not sure why, but I expected\nthe program to \u201cnetwork\u201d in the same way.  However,\nwhen I highlighted antecedent , what appeared on the\nscreen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent\nmissing, and preceding had reappeared.  If all this\nis too complicated to follow, let me summarize: you\nlook up word X and get synonyms A, B, C, D, E, F,\nand G.  You look up the synonyms for word A, and you\nget synonyms X, B, C, D, E, F, and G.  Even the\ndefinition provided for the sub-listings is identical in\nwording to that of the word originally sought.\n\n            This is very economical of space and involves a\nclever computer ploy, but it does not provide a particularly\nuseful synonym dictionary, for, as we all know,\nsynonymy in language does not yield to the commutative\nlaw of mathematics; in language, \u201cThings equal to\nthe same thing are not (necessarily) equal to each\nother.\u201d  Perhaps the Proximity people thought that they\nhad got round that little problem by giving the same\ndefinition for each of the items in the list; but we know\nthat only very rarely are two synonyms bi-unique\n(which is another way of saying that if A = B, B does\nnot necessarily always equal A), an ineluctable fact of\nlanguage.\n\n            If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary\nis likely to be of use, then this package may be of\nservice.  It works with a hard disk or with a set of\nfloppies and can be used with 29 popular word-processing\nprograms.  (That was the number listed when I\nreceived my copy; it might have increased.)  It also has\na few neat features, like suggesting a few alternatives if\nyou happen to think that preceding is spelt \u201cpreceeding\u201d\n(as many people do).  It has a useful \u201cHelp\u201d feature\nthat can be called upon at any stage.  Also, if you\nenter jump , you get the synonyms for that; but if you\nenter jumped , you get the (same) synonyms but inflected\u2014including\nthe variants leapt, leaped for leap .\nAll in all, for a relatively primitive system, it is not too\nbad; but you would have to be in love with your computer\nto use it in preference to a far more complete\nbooks of synonyms available (especially The Synonym\nFinder , Rodale in the U.S. and Canada, Longman\nelsewhere, which offers more than 800,000 synonyms,\nmore than three times the number listed in any other\nsynonym book).\n\n            The blurb on this book/disk package reads, \u201cSupplies\nyou with 470,000 true synonyms for 40,000 entries.\u201d\nMy guess is that such a quantity might be\nreached if one counted all the permutations and combinations;\nin reality, though, there are probably far\nfewer actual words.  Readers can judge for themselves\nthe validity of this numerical legerdemain.\n\n            Laurence Urdang\n         \n         \n            Family Words\n            In 1962, American Speech published \u201cFamily\nWords in English,\u201d by Allen Walker Read, which was\nreprinted in VERBATIM Vol. I, No. 4, (1975).  The article\nis a classic, probably the first on the subject to appear\nin a scholarly journal, though there are other informal\nreferences to family language, some of which are documented\nby Dickson in his Bibliography.\n\n            Family words and expressions crop up everywhere.\nSome are quite unique and their reporters cannot\nimagine their origin; others, like Penn Station ,\n\u201cwhat one family terms a child's misinterpretation of a\nfamous line or phrase,\u201d are clear: the generic term\ncomes from the Lord's Prayer\u2014\u201cAnd lead us not into\nPenn Station.\u201d  Obviously, that works only for kids familiar\nwith New York City.

There are\nmany interesting entries in Family Words which, as far\nas I know, is the first documentation of the genre.\nThere are occasional hidden entries, as the list of diseases\u2014among\nthem the dread mohogus \u2014under the\nentry for Fowlenzia .

A scaffold was built so that a rifleman\u2014\nwho fired a single-shot, muzzle-loading shoulder\nweapon\u2014could step up and shoot over the top of the\ntrench.  The soldier in charge would command, after\neach firing, that the rank on the scaffold step down\nand be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded,\nthus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire.\n\n            That war, like others, produced disgruntled veterans\nand those more adventurous or more restless after\nmilitary service.  They moved westward to start a new\nlife.  The population increased markedly, with corresponding\ndemands for goods and services, among them\nthe need for saloons.  Most new saloons were small and\nthe bars short, accommodating with difficulty the\nmany bunched up, in ranks, if you will, calling for\nwhiskey.  Many of the thirsty crowd were veterans, as\nwere many of the bartenders.  Thus, \u201cStep down (or\nback) and give me a shot\u201d was readily understood.  I've\nnot been able to corroborate this explanation, but I'll\nnever forget it.\n\n\n\n\n         \n         \n\n            Mr. Joseph Hymes' \u201cDo Mistake\u2014Learn Better\u201d\n[XV,1] brought to mind the time a Japanese acquaintance\ntold me of a friend of hers who decided to tackle\nthe original English version of three books she had\nenjoyed while in Japan.

The idea of a metal stand\ncarrying a pyramid of cannon balls so delicately balanced\nas to be affected by the tiny differential expansion\nof brass and iron does not bear thinking about in a\nheavy sea.\n\n            So what is the explanation of the phrase cold\nenough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey ?  Well,\nthe obvious one, I believe.  Anybody who asks \u201cWhy a\nbrass monkey?\u201d is probably not aware that brass monkeys\nwere very common household ornaments in England\nin the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Originally,\nthey were probably imported from India, but were\nlater mass-produced in places such as Birmingham to\ngrace Victorian and Edwardian mantelshelves.  They\ncan still be found today in so-called \u201cgift shops.\u201d  Usually,\nthey come in sets of three, one with its hands over\nits eyes, one over its ears, and one over its mouth: they\nwere said to represent \u201cSee no evil, Hear no evil, Speak\nno evil.\u201d  There were various whimsical variants.\n\n\n\n\n         \n         \n\n            I am sure I am not the first to point out Joseph\nHynes's, \u201cDo Mistake\u2014Learn Better,\u201d [XV,1] mistakes\nin Japanizing English words, e.g., sei fu not \u201csafe-o,\u201d\nnain not \u201cnine-o.\u201d  The possibilities for representing\nEnglish with a language of only forty-seven syllables\nare not that numerous, and the rules are very consistent.\nThe main problems are representing consonant\nclusters and word-final consonants.  These difficulties\nproduce such monstrosities as sutoraike for English\n`strike'\u2014one syllable in English, five in Japanese.\n\n            Every Japan veteran has his list of favorite mistakes.\nMine are the ones that are possible, but wrong,\nEnglish.  Adding the Japanese final vowels produces\nGone with the Windo .  Hypercorrection, where Japanese\nspeakers learn that many final vowels do not exist\nin the American version of the tongue and so remove\nthem, sometimes incorrectly, gives us the California\ncities of San Francisk and Sacrament .  This process\nresulted in the sign reading Pizz and Coffee .\n\n            My absolute favorite of these semantic mistakes,\nhowever, does not come from the problem of sound.\nJapanese has a verb inflection which expresses causation\nor permission\u2014in English, \u201cto make someone or\nto let someone do something.\u201d  One day during a university\nEnglish class, a very discomfited student, after\nfrantic and obtrusive dictionary work, handed a colleague\nof mine a scrap of paper.  On it was written this\nsentence: \u201cPlease make me go to the bathroom.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n         \n         \n            You Could Look It Up\n            As everyone in the world must know by now, William\nSafire writes a column in The New York Times\nMagazine called \u201cOn Language.\u201d  Considering the circulation\nof The New York Times on Sundays, his column\nis probably the most widely read commentary on\ncontemporary English in the world; that places more\nthan one uncommon burden on a writer: he must do\nhis utmost to be accurate; he must try to select subjects\nlikely to be of interest to his readers; and he must\nwrite well.\n\n            Those familiar with Safire's editorial style, reflected\nin his political columns on the editorial pages\nof The N. Y. Times , may agree with me in the contention\nthat when he writes about language he seems to\nbe writing on his day off: I cannot put my finger on\nwhy, but \u201cOn Language\u201d always strikes me as an excruciating\neffort to be cute.  In part, that is attributable\nto the designation of his correspondents, who\nkeep him informed on language that is not within\nearshot, as the \u201cLexicographic Irregulars,\u201d an amusing\nreference the first time or two it was used but now\nbeginning to cloy.  More often than it might prove of\ninterest to me, personally, Safire deals with insiders'\nlanguage in Washington (where he is based) or with\ntrivialities uttered by some politico.\n\n            As Andrew Norman wrote, in a letter published in\nthis book on page 113, \u201cYou flit freely back and forth\nbetween prescriptivism and descriptivism.\u201d  But are not\nmany of us guilty of that?  We are descriptive of the\nusages we accept and prescriptive\u2014perhaps proscriptive\nwould be more descriptive\u2014of those we do not\nlike.  At least Safire expresses an opinion; whether the\nreader agrees with him is another matter, as are the\nquestions of his accuracy, which arise fairly often, and\nthat of the suitability of his style, which, as far as I\nknow, has not been broached before.  It ill behooves\nme, excoriated recently as enamored of the \u201ccheap\nlarf,\u201d to criticize Safire's arch puns, which permeate\u2014\u201cenliven\u201d\nis probably the word his editor would\nuse\u2014his articles, but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable\nfor reading, however they might evoke a\nchuckle when uttered viva voce .  A handful of examples,\nfrom the book at hand:\n\n\nTherefore, I stand uncorrected. [p. 112]\n\n...\u201cGet your hand off my knee.\u201d  (That's a mnemonic,\npronounced knee-MONIC.)\n\nIze Right?  [title, p. 114]\n\nJuggernaughty but Nice [title, p. 115]\n\n...slanguist...[p. 116]\n\nLex Appeal [title, p. 121]\n\nLogue-Rolling [title, p. 123]\n\n[on -logue vs. -log:] Some people prefer their\nlogues sawed off...[p. 123]\n\nBut the Library of Congress wants to be non-U [in\nits spelling of -logue words].  [ibid.]\n            \n\n            Writing containing such labored figures makes for\nhard reading.  I am interested in what Safire has to say\nabout language but find myself stymied: I get the feeling\nthat he has deliberately created a minefield of\ninterruptions in thought through which I must pick\nmy way to the end.  Notwithstanding the valuable role\nhe plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language\nand in informing them about myriad facets of\nthe subject, I find it hard slogging (or, as he would\nprobably write, \u201csloguing\u201d).\n\n            \n               You Could Look It Up is the umpteenth collection\nof Safire's columns and, like the previous collections,\ncontains a selection of letters from readers.  It is those\nthat are so sorely missed in his column.  True, there is\nan occasional mention in his column of a point raised\nby a correspondent, and the Letters section of the\nMagazine prints a comment from time to time, but an\nimportant feature of the books is their inclusion of far\nmore writer-reader interaction than one might suspect\nfrom reading the column alone.  For one thing, the\nletter-writers call attention to errors or misinterpretations\nand are largely critical.  Safire cannot be accused\nof being copy-proud (except, evidently, of awful puns,\nas in \u201c Ms. is deliberately msterious , but at least it is\nnot deliberately msleading \u201d and other mscegenations).\n\n            There is no gainsaying that Safire is one of the\nmost influential writers on contemporary English, and\nit is essential that his books be in the libraries of all\nwho are interested in the subject, regardless of their\nalignment with his opinions.  For one thing, he documents\nmany neologisms, an activity that endears him\nto many working lexicographers.  From the sometimes\ncavalier manner in which he treats his subject, one\nwonders if Safire feels the burden of the responsibility\nhe has toward his readers.\n\n            The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from\nwhich this review was prepared; unfortunately, there\nwas no proof of an index, but the publisher has assured\nme that there will be one in the published book, a\nrather essential ingredient of a work with this title.\n\n            Laurence Urdang\n         \n         \n            Webster's New World Guide to Current American\nUsage\n\n            Here is a commonsense style book, useful to those\nwho have the education and common sense to be in\ndoubt about questions of English usage.  It has some\nproblems, if you want to be sticky about things: on p.\nxv we read:\n\n\n...Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity does\nnot say that E = MC\u00b2 and in leap year MC\u00b3.\n            \n\n            Indeed it does not.  But it does say E = mc\u00b2 ; the version\nwith the capital M and C is, essentially, meaningless\nto those familiar with the conventional symbolism used\nin physics.\n\n            While I acknowledge that it is not easy to know\nhow to sort out the many topics to be covered in a\nusage book, most reasonable writers have taken a stab\nat writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely\nplace to look, then have provided a detailed index.  Not\nBernice Randall.  True, one can find different from ,\netc., in an entry so headed, but for absolute constructions\none is referred to an entry called \u201cCovered with\nonions, relish, and ketchup, I ate a hotdog at the ball-park.\u201d\nIf the user wants to find out about misplaced\nadjectives and adverbs , reference is made to the entry\n\u201cElectric shaver for women with delicate floral design\non the handle.\u201d  A search for only would be futile.\n\n            Perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need\nsome lightening up, but I am hard put to agree that\nthey are quite as frivolous and light-headed as this\nbook would have us believe.  Fun is fun, but those who\nmight rely on such a book are quite serious about the\ninformation they are seeking, and it is unfair to play\nfast and loose with their sincerity.  A sense of humor\nabout a subject is born of a feeling of security about it,\nbut security is the one characteristic often lacking\namong those who would use Current American Usage .\n\n            There is no doubt that Randall enjoys her work.\nBut of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms?  And of\nwhat use are the interminable examples, for instance,\nof the misuse of like for as , which draw out the entry\nto three pages?  More than four pages are devoted to\nclich\u00e9s (under the guise of \u201cLo and behold, it's man's\nbest friend.,\u201d which, being an exclamation, really\nought to end in an exclamation point).  The article on\nBritish/American English (\u201cThere's no home like Eaton\nPlace.\u201d) is a good one, but, at six pages, its utility is\nquestionable.  In the matter of pronunciations of\nBrEng names, it is an old-fashioned fantasy of Americans\nthat Brits go round saying POM-frit for Pontefract :\nmost Brits that I have heard give the name a\nspelling pronunciation these days; and so with many of\nthe old shibboleths.  Of what relevance (to usage, notwithstanding\nthe fact that the topic is interesting) is an\nentry on eponyms (\u201cJohn Bull and John Hancock are\nnot just any johns.\u201d)?  That is not, strictly speaking, a\nsubject pertinent to the title of the book.\n\n            All of which is to say that the book is an interesting\nwork on the language and contains accurate,\nthough longwinded information about what it covers,\n\u201cinteresting and useful facts about American English.\u201d\nIts only real faults are its title, which belies the content,\nthe cutesy headings, and the lack of a truly detailed\nindex: self-indexing does not provide coverage of\nsufficient detail.  As a reference work on usage, it is far\nfrom complete: The Simon and Schuster Publicity Department\ncould have used an entry on foreword/\nforward (spelt \u201cforeward\u201d in the release accompanying\nthe review copy).\n\n            A longish section, \u201cSome Troublesome Idiomatic\nPrepositions,\u201d and a \u201cGlossary of Grammatical and\nLinguistic Terms Used in This Book,\u201d followed by a list\nof \u201cReferences,\u201d sources associated with specific entries,\nround out the work.\n\n            Laurence Urdang\n         \n         \n            Language Notes from Abroad\n\n\n            \u201cOnce more unto the breach for the warriors of\n1'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in their uphill battle to preserve\nthe purity of their native tongue.

The rationale behind referring to them as\n\u201clost\u201d arises from the author's observation of an unfortunate\nstate of affairs: because of an increasingly widespread\nlack of familiarity with the basic, structural\nelements of our culture\u2014Greek and Roman mythology,\nthe Bible, literature, and ordinary historical\nfact\u2014people today are unable to discern the origins of\nterms like aphrodisiac, Achilles [sic] heel or tendon,\nmeet one's Waterloo, sow dragon's teeth , and hand-writing\non the wall , to name a few.  There are many, of\ncourse, but unaccountably, they are not the focus of\nthis book.\n\n            Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions\nlike sow one's wild oats , about which he tells us little\nor nothing: the modern Latinate designation Avena\nfatua came too many centuries after the original expression\nto have any relevance to it, so why bring up\nthe information that fatua is Latin for `foolish': it was\nalso Latin for `wild,' which might be more to the\npoint.  In any event, it is hard to discern, from the arch\nstyle affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting,\njust what is the origin of sow one's wild oats .  In\nmany entries, Claiborne labors the obvious, offering\nlittle or nothing we do not already know, could easily\nimagine, or for which the author offers no explanation.\nAmong examples of the first are spit and polish,\non the spot, on the square, stick one's neck out , etc.\nExamples of the last include spill the beans, square the\ncircle, stalemate , etc.  Between these is an occasional\nflash of useful wisdom, much of it pretty well covered\nby other books of this type (which seem to be proliferating).\n\n            What is missing, for example, at square the circle ,\nis the information that because the area of a circle is\nmathematically calculated using pi , which is irrational,\nthere is no mathematical way of calculating the\ndimensions of a square with the same area as that of a\ngiven circle.  But that does not mean that such a square\ncannot exist.  As for stalemate , which is related to\ncheckmate , would it not have been important to indicate\nthat the - mate part has nothing to do with English,\nhaving been borrowed from checkmate which is a\nloanword from Persian (and has nothing to do with\ncheck , either).\n\n            Often, an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology\nand merely explains the meaning.  Does any\nreader need an entry like this one?\n\n            \n               straddle .  When you straddle a horse, you've got\none leg on either side of the animal.  When a\npolitican straddles an issue, he's in much the same\nposition.\n\n            Some speculative suggestions, as the derivation (or\nreinforcement) from Seidlitz powders for take a powder\nare sheer nonsense.  Not all entries contain misleading,\ndull, or incorrect information, but those that do\nnot are marked by a lack of originality.\n\n            Laurence Urdang\n         \n         \n            Word Maps\n\n            Dialect geography, a branch of dialectology, describes\ncertain features of the dialects of a language\nand their distribution.  The field is about 100 years old.\nMost prominent among its earliest practitioners in\nEngland was Joseph Wright, who prepared the six-volume\nEnglish Dialect Dictionary , which was published\nbetween 1898 and 1905; the best-known contemporary\nBritish specialist is Harold Orton.  In America,\nwork proceeded space during the 1930s, largely under\nthe direction of Raven McDavid, Hans Kurath, and,\nlater, Harold Allen; more recently, Lee Pedersen and\nothers have investigated American English dialects.\nBetween 1948 and 1961, fieldworkers based at the University\nof Leeds conducted the Survey of English Dialects,\nwhich studied 313 localities in England (which,\nas everyone ought to know, does not include Wales or\nScotland).  The present book is extracted from the two\nmajor works that resulted from the Survey, The Linguistic\nAtlas of England (1978) and A Word Geography\nof England (1974), both under the direction of Harold\nOrton, aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the latter\neffort.\n\n            People generally seem to find dialect study interesting.\nOne letter writer to The Times [21 June 1988]\nreported:\n\n\nOur close neighbour... in Bere Regis, who was\nborn in the village and who speaks with a delicious\nDorset burr, always uses \u201cI\u201d instead of \u201cme.\u201d...\n\n\u201cWell, it makes company for I and company for\nshe.\u201d  Another of his happy expressions is inner-wards,\nmeaning `since,' as in...\u201cI chucked him\nout the door and he's not been back innerwards.\u201d\n            \n\n            Another reported [same date]:\n\n\nLet's get it right.  The Bristol for \u201cme\u201d is not \u201cI,\u201d\nbut \u201coi.\u201d  When I was teaching there, the explanation\ninvariably given by boys brought to me for\nscrapping in the playground was: \u201cEe it oi, so oi\nit ee.\u201d\n            \n\n            The 100 maps selected for representation from the\nSurvey yield information on several hundred words,\nsome of which are clear variants, others quite different\nlexical entities.  For instance, Map 34 shows the areas,\nmarked off by boundary lines, where the variants\nchimley chimbley, chimmock, chimdey, chimbey , and\nchimney occur.  Map 33 shows the distribution of child\n(most of southern England) and of bairn (north of a\nslightly wavy line between Boston, on the Wash to the\neast, and Lancaster, on the west coast).\n\n            The authors have provided a brief introduction\nwhich is easy to follow, a list of suggested readings,\nand the names and addresses of the several institutions\nand societies in Britain where readers may indulge a\nmore intensive interest in dialect study.  The maps are\nclear, each occupying a full page, and the word information\nis well set forth on them.  Where necessary,\nbrief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any\ninformation that might seem to be out of the ordinary.\nI have only one nit to pick with the authors.  In their\ndescription of isoglosses , they write:\n\n\nThese are drawn to run midway between/\nlocalities which were shown by the Survey of\nEnglish Dialects to use the different words or\npronunciations which are the subject of the map.\n            \n\n            Although it is true that isoglosses, in effect, set off the\nvarious areas where a particular usage was recorded,\nmore accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites\neither where speakers employ both usages or where\nspeakers using one or the other live in very close proximity.\nHence, the term isogloss , from iso - `same' + gloss\n`word,' to describe the line on a map where the terms\nare of equal distribution.  Isoglosses are to dialect maps\nwhat isobars and isotherms are to weather maps, what\nisobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans, etc.\nThe authors are not alone in getting this wrong: it is\nincorrect in some dictionaries.\n\n            In those countries where dialect study is undertaken,\ndialectologists observe that there are today\nmany factors militating against the strict maintenance\nof older dialect boundaries: the standardization of terminology\nas adopted by national periodicals, news\nservices, radio, and television; the establishment of\n\u201cprestige\u201d dialects and, through the media, their\npromulgation; and the huge population shifts that\nhave taken place, particularly in the U.S. since WWII.\nSuch shifts have been somewhat slower in England,\nbut seem now to be speeding up.  There are many\nother, lesser factors at work, but taken together, all\ntend toward standardization, especially as the older\nspeakers die off.  In some respects, it may not be long\nbefore certain aspects of dialect geography will be\nlargely historical.  The importance of dialect is emphasized\nregularly in the press, where we read about people\nbeing killed, as in parts of India, because they use\nthe wrong shibboleths.\n\n            This book is a good introduction to the subject (in\nEngland); those familiar with dialectology in\nAmerica, and those interested in the study in England\nor, indeed, generally would be well advised to add\nWord Maps to their libraries.\n\n            Laurence Urdang\n         \n         \n            American Literary Almanac\n\n            This is an interesting, useful reference book containing\ninformation about the better-known writers of\nAmerica.  It is divided into eighteen chapters varying\nin length, each dealing with a different aspect of the\nauthors and their works, among them,\n\n\nWriters Related to Writers\nSchooldays (which colleges and universities\nspawned which writers)\nAmerican Literary Pseudonyms\nAmerican Literary Title Sources\nLiterary Cons: Hoaxes, Frauds, and Plagiarism\nin American Literature\nThe Profession of Authorship:\n\nAuthors/Publishers/ Editors/Agents\nThrown to the Wolves: Reviews and Reviewers\n            \n\n            These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography\nand a detailed Index.\n\n            As can be seen from the chapter headings, some of\nthe material is trivial, but nonetheless interesting for\nthat.  It is not at once apparent why the book is styled\nan \u201calmanac,\u201d but that is unimportant: there is no\nother book I know of that contains as much diverse\ninformation about American writers as this one.  Its\nreadability and organization make it suitable for\nbrowsing\u2014even for reading straight through\u2014so in\nthat respect, at least, it does not resemble books in the\n\u201cOxford Companion\u201d series.  It contains many photographs\nof writers, some quite early; these enliven the\nappearance of the book but accomplish little else, unless\none is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked\nlike at the age of 15 (as a printer's devil) or in the\nappearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle of a\nrailroad track in Cleveland in 1916.\n\n            It is difficult to make any sensible connection between\nthe lives of authors and their creations.  A handful\nmight have led colorful existences, some are objects\nof interest because they died early, committed suicide,\nwere related to (other) famous people, and so forth;\nbut such information seldom reveals as much about\ntheir output as do the creations themselves, and in\ncertain cases one is probably better off not knowing\nquite so much.\n\n            This book appears to have been diligently researched\nand has much to recommend it as an adjunct\nto most libraries, public and private, large and small,\ngeneral and specialized.\n\n            Laurence Urdang\n         \n         \n            \n\u201cFaculty protest against apartheid at Cornell.\u201d  [TV\nnews tease, WHEC, Rochester, .

We want you to\n      Know why your support of Goodwill is so important.\n      Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and\n      Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that\n      comes with work.\n      \"I was sad when I couldn't go to the snack bar to buy a soda. Now I\n      can buy a soda and spend money. I like working and making money. I have a\n      savings account. I can write my name on the deposit slip. If I wasn't\n      working here ...I would be sad ...\" -- Maureen\n      Because turning welfare recipients into tax payers just makes\n      sense.\n      \"When I first came to Goodwill I was a single parent with little or no\n      self-esteem. I was on welfare and without my diploma. Coming to Goodwill\n      was the first step toward my becoming totally independent. I am now\n      ...totally off of welfare. I really like my job.\" -- Sherry\n      Because people want to work.\n      \"I'd never finished high school. I had no experience or skills ... The\n      only thing I did know for sure was here's a chance to change things for\n      me and my children... I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow. I\n      wanted to be there ...I had my second chance to change my life.\" --\n      Donna\n      Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire\n      life.\n      \"Before I got to Goodwill, I was on a mission. I just wanted a job. It\n      didn't matter what the job was, I just wanted one. Now, I'm on a journey.\n      I've got more than a job; I've got a career. My instructor played a role\n      like no other instructor I've ever had I appreciate everything that\n      Goodwill has done for me.\" -- Cornell\n      Each year, we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles.\n      Their one common goal: they all want to work. A robust economy helps by\n      providing job opportunities, but to be honest, most of the people who\n      aren't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest\n      obstacles.\n      The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like\n      health care, transportation and child care -problems that are big enough\n      on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental\n      disabilities, illiteracy and lack of job skills.\n      Last year, Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their\n      self-sufficiency. Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support\n      services that will help even more find jobs.\n      Right now, there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels\n      like to support themselves. You can help them to know that feeling.\n      Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs.

She tells me that the 3,666 people\n      we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars. In\n      addition to that, by helping them find jobs, Goodwill reduced the state's\n      Public Support tab by an estimated $4 million. Your gift to Goodwill will\n      help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly\n      support our work.\n      What kind of work does Goodwill do?\n      Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities.\n      After Maureen's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant,\n      we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with\n      physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in\n      the middle of society. Remember what she said in my last letter? \"If I\n      wasn't working here...I would be sad...\"\n      Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance. Sherry learned\n      through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the\n      welfare system and support her family. At Goodwill she gained in\n      self-confidence, in her vision of her future and in the job skills she\n      needed to find and keep a good job. \"Coming to Goodwill was the first\n      step toward my becoming totally independent. I am now... totally off of\n      welfare.\"\n      Goodwill prepares people for life-long employment. Cornell found a\n      number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a\n      work-site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry. He trained in\n      desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with\n      new-found skills in a burgeoning industry. \"I've got more than a job;\n      I've got a career.\"\n      Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill. After a lifetime of trials, Donna\n      not only earned her GED at Goodwill, she earned a job here. \"I rode a\n      bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow. I wanted to be there...I had my\n      second chance to change my life.\"\n      Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their\n      own stories of success. Your support will help them go to work.\n      Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill\n      today!\n      Sincerely,\n      William A Carter, Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation\n      P.S. Your gift is a wise investment in the community. For every dollar\n      donated to Goodwill in 1998, we helped our \"graduates\" earn an estimated\n      $102.

His job\n      objectives call for him to do it in 30.\n      He has no time to waste.\n      Neither do we. With the help of friends like you, Goodwill has\n      continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing\n      society.\n      We don't waste time as we are helping the community.

The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to\n      continue our mission of helping people prepare for, find and keep\n      jobs.\n      In their December, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, U.S.\n      News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five \"Standout Good\n      Guys.\" The magazine stated that Goodwill (as well as the other standouts)\n      is \"uniquely effective, innovative or valuable.\"\n      While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the\n      true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on\n      problems that affect all of us.\n      Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment\n      barrier, the positive effects radiate throughout our community: The\n      business community welcomes not only another worker, but a consumer with\n      increased purchasing power. Parents act as role models of\n      self-sufficiency instead of dependency. Tax dollars that would have been\n      spent on public assistance are saved.\n      You and I know that solutions to difficult problems don't just happen.\n      At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our\n      services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day:\n      A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: \"You\n      can earn the money to support yourself and your family,\" she says. \"You\n      can get off welfare. I know you can... I did.\"\n      A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview\n      to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing\n      training program. once his tears have subsided, he confirms what his\n      classmates have already figured out: he just received a job offer -- his\n      first in five years.\n      Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member\n      tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs. On his\n      way home, he shares the story with four people at a street corner. At the\n      next corner he tells five more.\n      In order to develop job skills, a man with some serious disabilities\n      begins working in Goodwill's industrial division. It takes a long time\n      for him to gain the self-confidence to work elsewhere in the community.\n      Eventually, he turns your support into a payoff for all of us. He proudly\n      leaves Goodwill to support himself.\n      These people and their successes are real. Just like the respect we've\n      earned from U.S. News & World Report. Just like the impact Goodwill's\n      work has on our community.\n      Real work. Real results. A real difference in people's lives -- in all\n      of our lives.\n      The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no\n      time to waste. Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of\n      their success. Your support helps provide real solutions.\n      Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously\n      to Goodwill today.\n      Sincerely,\n      \n      \n      Jack Dustman Board Member and Former Chairman\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "110CYL069", "class": "letters"}

Think of the joy and success\n      they bring to you and your loved ones.\n      Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job.\n      Michael was born with cerebral palsy. Upon entering the work force, he\n      discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities.\n      For several years he performed packaging and clerical work. His most\n      recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs eliminated his\n      position.\n      For 18 long months Michael could not find a job. He resorted to public\n      assistance dollars to survive. Finally, Michael called Goodwill.\n      At Goodwill, Michael's counselors felt that his personable demeanor\n      could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match\n      where his people skills could shine.\n      After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person\n      for the job. As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments, he now\n      provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night.\n      At last, he has found success in a job that he loves. Now his goals\n      are set on moving up in the company.\n      Every year, thousands of people come to Goodwill. Like Michael, they\n      share two common characteristics. They face some barrier to employment\n      and they want to work.\n      With support from people like you, they can overcome their barriers\n      and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it. And then\n      the pay-off begins for the entire community.\n      Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public\n      support and more paying taxes. Last year, participants in Goodwill\n      programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million.\n      Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of\n      a million dollars in public assistance.\n      The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however.\n      The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms\n      of a house to live in, money to purchase food -- without food stamps --\n      and the beginning of a family focused on success, not hopelessness.\n      Won't you help make all of these successes possible? Please send the\n      largest contribution you can comfortably make. Your gift will help give\n      new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason\n      to use the word.\n      Sincerely,\n      James M. McClelland President\n      P.S. Your gift will make a difference.

They come into a\n      Pleasant Run program... whether it's for therapeutic help in their own\n      homes (which nurtures whole families), through foster care families or in\n      the familial surroundings of our residential homes.\n      For some, it's a matter of weeks or months; for others, it's years.\n      They leave Pleasant Run, generally, ready and able to contribute to\n      society.

Others are from families that are struggling to provide a\n      healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it\n      possible. Your contribution will make a difference in a child's life. It\n      may help a family stay together. It can certainly make happy holiday\n      memories.\n      A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have\n      presents to open. A gift means a family will have a holiday meal, cooking\n      utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on. Your gift will go\n      beyond the holiday season. It can help purchase clothing, school\n      supplies, books and educational tools throughout the year.\n      \n      Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run.

In 1998, MCCOY,\n      Inc. led two efforts that, we believe, will help our community continue\n      to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop\n      well.\n      Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified\n      three goals for all our youth to obtain: economic self-sufficiency,\n      healthy family, social relationships, and involvement in the community. A\n      short time later, the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young\n      people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow\n      up well: caring adults, safe places to go, and positive things to do.\n      One group of adults and one group of youth, through two very different\n      processes, have arrived at the same conclusion; our community still has\n      much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into\n      the responsible, productive adults who will our community in the\n      future.\n      As a provider of youth services, MCCOY, Inc. is here to support your\n      valuable efforts to develop young people. Recently, through a lot of hard\n      work and alliances with organizations like yours, some steps have been\n      taken in our community that will help young people continue to be\n      involved in positive activities. One, IndyGo in April adopted a\n      much-needed policy that all young people under the age of 19 may ride on\n      their buses at half the normal fare all year long. Two, funding was made\n      available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct\n      positive youth programming on Saturday evenings. Through the youth\n      mapping process, it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for\n      youth on weekend evenings were lacking. That need is being met.\n      As it has been an exciting year for all of us, MCCOY, Inc. cannot do\n      its part without the support of organizations like yours. Annually, we\n      ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort\n      to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis. Enclosed is a donation\n      card that will enable you to make Indianapolis a great place for ALL of\n      us to live. If you have any questions or concerns at any time, please do\n      not hesitate to call me at 921-1288.\n      Sincerely,\n      John F.

As you begin that process this year, I would like to\n      ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more\n      positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County\n      Commission on Youth, Inc.\n      MCCOY Inc., originally founded as a government agency but re-organized\n      in 1993 as an independent not-for-profit, is a county-wide youth services\n      coordinating, planning, and convening agency. Its purpose is to encourage\n      collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies, programs, and\n      systems that serve our community's youth. In addition to that\n      behind-the-scenes role, MCCOY has taken an out-front role in developing a\n      Summer Bus Pass, neighborhood youth councils, and the We Value Youth\n      information line. It is our goal that every young person in Marion County\n      have access to the programs and services that can best assist them in\n      their growth toward a positive adulthood.\n      I am hopeful that you as an individual and Meridian Insurance as a\n      corporation might consider becoming sustaining supporters of MCCOY. I\n      have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as\n      an application with various options for supporting the youth of our\n      community.\n      I obviously can't tell the whole story of MCCOY in a single letter but\n      I hope this provides an overview of the scope of our work. I will call\n      you in a few weeks to discuss your level of interest.

MCCOY was\n      reorganized as an independent, not-for-profit agency, separate from local\n      government. It retained, however, the same mission with which it had been\n      charged from its inception: to serve as a catalyst for effective,\n      coordinated, and collaborative service delivery to youth in our\n      community.\n      For the past three years, MCCOY has been actively engaged in\n      accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others:\n      youth service providers, youth, funding bodies, and interested citizens\n      to name a few.\n      We have met with a number of successes along the way, most notably the\n      Summer Fun Line, the Metro Summer Bus Pass, and the development of ten\n      neighborhood youth councils. A Providers Council and a Youth Coalition\n      are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the\n      years to come. The formation of The Community Academy, a pilot project\n      directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about\n      as a result of MCCOY's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response\n      to a pressing issue.\n      McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community\n      collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the\n      inclusion of young people in both decision-making and program planning\n      processes. One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the\n      United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of\n      Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne,\n      Indiana. As a team, these three organizations are working with\n      neighborhood youth and adults to build a \"Caring Neighborhood with Youth\"\n      , mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a\n      better neighborhood for all.\n      Since its re-organization, MCCOY has established its unique niche\n      within the community by refraining from direct service programming and\n      focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening\n      groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs,\n      and moving toward collaborative solutions. McCoy has only one interest:\n      the well being of Marion County's young people.\n      McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount\n      of $10,000.00 to support such activities as:\n      ---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth\n      empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of\n      neighborhood-based youth councils; ---- the promotion of youth employment\n      opportunities; ---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding\n      effective and efficient youth service delivery;\n      ---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to\n      neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships;\n      ---- the development of community-wide supports for the positive\n      growth of all Marion County young people.\n      In the last several years, the business and corporate community has\n      recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to\n      the development of a competent workforce. Youth who are supported and\n      encouraged by both a family and a society that values\n      \n      Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and\n      contributing members of adult society. While we have made significant\n      inroads, there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do\n      it alone. We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be\n      successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people\n      can grow and develop well. Your contribution will enable us to both\n      continue and expand the good work we have begun in making Indianapolis a\n      city famous for its commitment to youth and families.\n      In our fund raising efforts to date, we have received the support of\n      local government, foundations, and corporations as well as the personal\n      financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members. We believe there\n      is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative\n      effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community\n      as a whole.\n      Thanking you in advance for your support, we remain,\n      Sincerely,\n      John T.

We know that children do better when they\n      have a network of caring adults to nurture and motivate them. When young\n      people don't have that support, they need other resources for\n      encouragement to guide them along the way. Big Sisters helps bridge that\n      gap by providing children with the resources they need -- Big Sisters\n      volunteers.\n      Big Sisters are mentors and friends who empower girls to more fully\n      reach their potential, experience life's opportunities and perhaps begin\n      to dream. The relationships that are formed provide strong foundations\n      from which healthy values and strong self-confidence can grow, helping\n      youth become strong, independent adults of tomorrow.\n      This year we will serve over 1,000 girls through our mentoring\n      programs. This is an impressive number; but for each girl served, more\n      are left unserved. Over 150 girls are currently waiting for a Big\n      Sister.\n      You can make an impact by supporting Big Sisters Annual Campaign and\n      our $200,000 goal.

It is a pivotal time in the life of a young girl-when\n      small changes in her behavior, or the choices she makes, can affect her\n      future. It's hard enough for her to make good decisions when she's\n      surrounded by support. It's even harder when she isn't.\n      Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring, responsible adult\n      volunteers with at-risk girls, ages 8-14. A Big Sister is a mentor, a\n      friend and a role model, helping a young girl to develop the\n      self-confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible,\n      productive and successful adult. Your $1,000 contribution can put a\n      mentor in a child's life-and hope in a child's future.\n      The results of an 18-month study completed by Public/Private Ventures\n      showed that children participating in one-to-one Big Sister and Big\n      Brother matches for just one year, reduced first time drug use by 46%;\n      lowered school absenteeism by 52%; cut aggressive behavior by 33%;\n      enhanced school performance; and improved relations with family and\n      friends.\n      This is positive proof that Big Sisters one-to-one mentoring program\n      helps change lives. Today, we are offering you the opportunity to help\n      change a life. By contributing $1,000 you can support one match for one\n      year. This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports\n      the development of effective relationships. This includes a volunteer\n      screening process, orientation, training and ongoing supervision and\n      support by a professional staff.\n      As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of \"your match\" and be\n      identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office, in the\n      agency newsletter and annual report.\n      Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana.

With\n      your help, we can change that.\n      Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full\n      of hope and with a positive outlook. Thanks to our Big Sisters\n      volunteers, these young people are self-confident, believe in themselves\n      and are beginning to realize their full potential.

HawkNew York, NY 10128President/CEO\n            www.aspca.org\n            \n            \n            \n            His belly was empty. So empty it hurt.\n            At least Astro could drink water from a puddle\n            near the stake he was chained to. But then\n            the puddle dried up. Astro had only a few days to live.\n            \n            \n            Dear Friend:\n            \n            As you read my letter, somewhere -- perhaps not far from you --someone is inflicting pain on an innocent animal ... an animal like Astro.\n            \n            You may not be able to rescue that particular animal. But you CAN join the crusade to stop animal abuse and neglect, by making a generous contribution to the ASPCA today.\n            \n            I have sent you the enclosed complimentary name-and-address labels to call your attention to the work of the ASPCA. Please USE them on your correspondence to help get our name in front of as many people as possible. Because the ASPCA -- and the thousands of animals we help every year --need all the friends we can get!\n            \n            As a person who cares about animals, you\u2019re probably anxious to know what happened to Astro. A neighbor reported Astro\u2019s plight to the ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers went to investigate.\n            \n            When our officers arrived, Astro was too weak to even stand up. The officers knelt down slowly, speaking gently to the emaciated dog.\n            \n            Then they saw it. Astro was wagging his tail. He was barely moving. but yes -- the poor, sick dog was saying. \u201cWelcome, friends!\u201d\n            \n            The officers brought Astro to the ASPCA\u2019s Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital. The dog weighted only 45 pounds -- less than half of what a dog his size should weigh -- and he had several infections. But with first-rate medical attention and tender care from ASPCA staff, he slowly got well again.\n            \n            Stories like Astro\u2019s are all too common. Every day, the ASPCA gets reports of animal cruelty, abuse, and neglect. Every day, our officers rescue animals like Sammy, a 10-month-old kitten who was deliberately thrown from a high-rise window by teenagers.\n            \n            In a world where cruelty is common, animals like Sammy and Astro desperately need friends like you. That is why I have written to you -- to ask you to support the ASPCA today.\n            \n            Our vital anti-cruelty efforts are just part of the ASPCA mission. We also find loving adoptive homes for rescued animals ... provide first-rate veterinary care through our Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital ... offer low-cost spay and neuter programs for cats and dogs ... reach out to children, teachers, and parents through our Education Programs.\n            \n            And we don\u2019t stop there. The ASPCA pushes for the passage and strengthening of anti-cruelty laws, so that crimes against animals will be treated with the seriousness they deserve.\n            \n            Since the ASPCA was founded in 1866 as America\u2019 s first humane society, ending cruelty has been our primary goal. Today, over 130 years later, the scope of the problem is greater than ever.\n            \n            The ASPCA urgently needs your help to push back the tide of violence against animals. The task is too large for the ASPCA to handle without emergency assistance from dedicated friends. That is why I\u2019m asking you to join the ASPCA today with your gift of $20 or more if at all possible.\n            \n            Your contribution will help us rescue more animals like Astro ... make sure the perpetrators of cruelty are brought to justice ... nurse abused animals back to health and find them loving adoptive homes. Please help the ASPCA with your most generous gift today -- the animals are counting on you.\n            \n            Sincerely,\n            \n            \n            \n            Hawk, DVM\n            and CEO\n            \n            \n            P.S.We found Astro a wonderful adoptive home. He is the pride and joy of this loving family!

The USDA wants to conduct an \u201cexperiment\u201d that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds.\n            \n            And if the death of two million birds doesn\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d their theory -- and show a reduction in crop loss -- they\u2019ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year!\n            \n            It\u2019s time to tell the USDA, in no uncertain terms:\n            \n            \u201cYOU WILL NOT CONDUCT MASSIVE BIRD KILLS\n            \n            TO BENEFIT A HANDFUL OF SPECIAL INTERESTS!\u201d\n            \n            Because the USDA\u2019s slow-acting pesticide takes three days to kill, its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields, before falling to the ground.\n            \n            Meanwhile,blackbirds aren\u2019t the only birds threatened directly by the poison. We\u2019ve noted the presence of 68 other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poison-baited areas ... including the Bobolink, Grasshopper Sparrow, Harris\u2019 Sparrow and Le Conte\u2019s Sparrow.\n            \n            In all, nine birds on the Federal threatened or endangered lists and 11 birds on Audubon\u2019s WatchList of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields.\n            \n            We simply cannot afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past ... and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife.\n            \n            Here\u2019s what I need you to do, to make sure we prevail: First, I need you to sign and return your Petition to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.\n            \n            I\u2019ll forward your Petition, along with those from thousands of other Audubon members and supporters, urging the USDA to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds ... in favor of alternative, benign methods of protecting sunflower crops.\n            \n            I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make a difference -- just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago!\n            \n            But today\u2019s battle is one we must win ... to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase 50 years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment.\n            \n            That\u2019s why I hope you\u2019ll also agree to help even more by making a tax-deductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of Audubon\u2019s vital conservation work to protect birds, other wildlife and habitat. And with a donation of $15 or more, you\u2019ll receive a FREE Birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern.\n            \n            I\u2019ll make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to:\n            \n            \u00b7Win a ban on the USDA bird poisoning.\n            \u00b7Gain strict enforcement of wildlife laws.\n            \u00b7Ensure wildlife programs are based on sound science.\n            \u00b7Monitor the health of Audubon\u2019s WatchList species.\n            \u00b7Conserve America\u2019s remaining grassland habitat.\n            \n            And Audubon will draw upon its century-long track record of highly effective conservation work to make a real difference in other key areas:\n            \n            Audubon protects birds. Your help will be instrumental to our bird conservation work: designating Important Bird Areas to protect vital habitat ... maintaining the WatchList of bird species near endangered status (www.audubon.org/ bird/watch) ... and engaging citizen participation in the vast BirdSource database of North American bird trends.\n            \n            Audubon rescues endangered wildlife. Nearly 25 years ago, the National Audubon Society helped win passage of the Endangered Species Act.

Soon this wolf won\u2019t be merely running in the snow.\n         This wolf will be running for its life!\n         The airplane above will be tracking her ... in order to land and immediately gun her down .\n         \n         You see, the Alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a $15 trapping or $25 hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down. This cruel, unethical wolf-hunting practice is called \u201csame-day airborne land-and-shoot.\u201d\n         It was a total shock and surprise.\n         In May the Alaska legislature voted to reinstate same-day airborne wolf killing. Frankly, we never thought Alaska\u2019s anti-wolf politicians would go this far. But they did, overriding Governor Tony Knowles\u2019 veto \u2014 and ignoring the will of the majority of Alaska\u2019s citizens.\n         Unfortunately, this practice will begin after the first snow ... this September ... when wolves will be \u201ccan\u2019t-miss\u201d targets against Alaska\u2019s snowy terrain. Wolves can run fast \u2014 but they certainly can\u2019t outrun airplanes.\n         Given the urgency of the situation in Alaska, Defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save Alaska\u2019s wolves from same-day airborne land-and-shoot slaughter.\n         Support the Emergency Effort to Save Alaska\u2019s Wolves.\n         \n         Defenders hopes to raise at least $100,000 to help Alaskans For Wildlife, a coalition of Alaska citizens, win a citizens\u2019 ballot initiative this November. And we face very wealthy opponents. So today, I urge you to do these two things:\n         FIRST: Sign the enclosed Citizens\u2019 Advisory Ballot to show our Alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on \u201csame-day airborne\n         land-and-shoot\u201d wolf killing in Alaska;\n         SECOND: Rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in November.\n         The Alaska Legislature is completely out of step with the will of Alaska\u2019s citizens and the American public at large.\n         Like you, the majority of Alaskans oppose same-day land-and-shoot wolf killing. But the anti-wolf politicians in the Alaska legislature don\u2019t care what the majority of Alaska citizens want. And they didn\u2019t listen to the recommendations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, which opposed this legislation!\n         They are utterly out of step with their Alaska constituents ... the state agency that manages Alaska wildlife ... and the rest of the American public!\n         In the name of \u201cwolf control,\u201d wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion, so that the wolves have, literally, no chance of survival.\n         And if history is any guide, over the years thousands of Alaska\u2019s wolves will be brutally killed.\n         Before the 1996 ban on same-day land-and-shoot, as many as 400 wolves were killed in Alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice.\n         Anti-wolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new land-and-shoot law stands \u2014 even though most Alaskans do not support it.\n         So if we don\u2019t act right now, Alaska\u2019s snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in America\u2019s \u201cLast Frontier.\u201d\n         Say \u201cNO\u201d to the barbaric practice of same-day airborne wolf killing.\n         The only way Alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on same-day airborne land-and-shoot wolf killing is with a Citizens\u2019 Referendum.\n         That\u2019s why your special financial support is so important \u2014 and urgently needed.\n         Alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves.\n         As I mentioned, this new same-day airborne land-and-shoot practice will start in September after the opening of hunting season and the first snow \u2014 and when wolves will be an easy target.\n         To repeal this unconscionable law, Defenders must help provide our friends in Alaska -- Alaskans For Wildlife \u2014 with the resources necessary to win at the polls in November.\n         Our well-funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure. We need help to supplement the funds raised by Alaskans For Wildlife for careful polling, the development of voter education spots for television, radio and newspapers, the placement of those ads, and \u201cget-out-the-vote\u201d efforts on election day.\n         If Alaska\u2019s new law is not replaced, thousands of Alaska's wolves will die in the years to come.\n         And it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide \u2014 at a time when the American public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection. A loss will encourage those anti-wolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild.\n         So, please don\u2019t wait another minute.\n         Please sign your Citizens\u2019 Advisory Ballot to demonstrate to our Alaska allies that you\u2019re behind them; and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort.\n         So how will your money be spent?\n         Here\u2019s the projected budget breakdown:\n         $35,000 \u2014 in-depth, state-wide survey conducted by a top pollster to determine voters\u2019 positions on the ballot measure and arguments that will help persuade undecided voters.\n         $45,000 \u2014 salaries /office expenses for staff to oversee the effort between now and election day.\n         $30,000 \u2014 production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey.\n         $100,000 \u2014 placement of voter education spots in the key media including print, radio and television. Money must be in hand by mid-August to reserve time for September and October!\n         $15,000 \u2014 election day \u201cget-out-the-vote\u201d drive, including phone calls to get voters to the polls.\n         You stood by Defenders when we defeated the wealthy American Farm Bureau in court and saved the lives of the wolves in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho.\n         Now, I\u2019m hoping I can count on your moral and financial support again today. to help save Alaska\u2019s wolves from same-day airborne land-and-shoot killing.\n         Your special donation today is absolutely critical, because many of Alaska\u2019s politicians clearly have anti-wolf agendas. They have the financial backing of powerful special interests and the determination to ignore the will of the people of Alaska and the American public.\n         Please let Alaskans know that you\u2019re behind them. Let them know you share their concern about protecting Alaska\u2019s wolves.\n         Please help save Alaska\u2019s wolves by doing these two things:\n         1. SIGN the enclosed Citizens\u2019 Advisory Ballot to show your support\n         for repealing \u201csame-day airborne land-and-shoot\u201d wolf killing in Alaska;\n         2. RUSH a special donation to help our Alaska allies overturn this odious new law.\n         Remember, for this emergency effort to succeed, we must act immediately.\n         So, please take out your pen right now and sign your absentee ballot. And then, mail it back to us along with your emergency donation to help save Alaska\u2019s wolves.\n         Thank you for your strong support.\n         Sincerely,\n         Rodger Schlickeisen\n         President\n         P.S.:\tDefenders needs your help to raise $100,000 in emergency funds to help ensure that the coalition\u2019s Emergency Effort to Save Alaska\u2019s Wolves succeeds. So, please sign the\n         enclosed Citizens\u2019 Advisory Ballot to lend your moral support to our Alaska friends and return it in the enclosed envelope with a special donation.

For too many, this is a daily reality \u2014 but today you can help make a\ndifference.\nHaving a guide dog allows a blind or visually impaired individual to experience the\npossibilities of life, not the limitations.\nIt costs over $20,000 to breed, care for and train a guide dog like \u201cDuke\u201d and to\ntrain his blind teammate. We use Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and a cross\nbetween Labs and Goldens. Male and female dogs are used. And our dogs are specially\nbred for temperament and physical soundness.\nEvery Foundation guide dog is given free of charge to someone who is blind or\nvisually impaired.\nWe are supported entirely by donations from generous individuals, corporations and\nfoundations. We receive no government funding.\nThe only way we can continue to provide guide dogs, at no cost, to someone who is\nblind or visually impaired, is through your support.\n\nFriends like you make it possible to give the gift of \u201cSecond Sight\u00ae\u201d. I hope the\nFoundation can count on your caring donation today. Many people send gifts of $35,\n$50, or even $100 or more \u2014 whatever you are able to give to help\nmaintain this vital service.\n\nAnd having a guide dog does make a real difference in the lives of our students. It\u2019s\nthe special bond \u2014 of a loving and working 24 hour a day partnership.\n\u201cAs a boy in Bosnia, I walked my dog. Now my guide dog, Franklin, walks me\u201d says\nSead. He was blinded at 15 by a Serbian missile. \u201cAfter I got my beautiful black Lab,\nI finally felt like a human being again. Now I believe almost anything is possible.\nFranklin has opened up a whole new world for me. A world I thought I would never have\nagain.\u201d\nAs Pat explains, \u201cBoth my friends were zipping through crowds while I lagged behind,\neven though I was a fast cane walker. I envied their freedom and most of all, the\nincredible bond they both had with their guide dogs. With my Lab, Jay, I feel so\nwonderfully FREE!\u201d\nHank says he was a good cane traveler for 17 years \u2014 but felt his freedom was\ncurtailed particularly when traveling. \u201cI had never had a pet. Having Aries just\nmakes life so much easier. For one thing, people are nicer to you. People love dogs.\nThey can relate to him and feel they have something to talk to you about.\u201d\nOur graduates, who are leading active lives assisted by the guide dogs given to them\nby the Guide Dog Foundation, include: social workers, teachers, secretaries, policy\nmakers, college students, musicians, writers, homemakers... mothers and fathers.\nAs one of our donors in the New York area told us, \u201cSometimes you never see the good\nwork your money does. I see the results... the guide does I\u2019ve helped sponsor\ndramatically improve the lives of the men and women who receive them.\u201d\nWon\u2019t you please take the time now to send your donation to give someone the\npriceless gift of independence?\nSincerely,\nWells B. Jones\nChief Executive Officer\nRS.

The sad truth is animal cruelty, abuse and neglect continues at an alarming rate across the nation and even in your own community.\n            \n            Every day of the year, The Humane Society of the United States receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties, such as the horrors of the leghold trap; the use of dog and cat fur; needless or repetitive experiments on animals; and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats.\n            \n            Still others are less obvious but just as horrible; dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers; baby calves confined and malnourished to provide \u201cmilk-fed\u201d veal for the gourmet; and the \u201caccidental\u201d drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen. And almost 6,000,000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America.\n            \n            What is even more shocking, is that more than 30 million animals die these cruel, painful deaths each year ... needless deaths that could have been stopped!\n            \n            And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on, I\u2019m sure you can understand why the work of The Humane Society of the United States is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people, like you, to help us bring an end to animal suffering, abuse and neglect.\n            \n            Since 1954, our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties.\n            \n            We also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local, state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty.\n            \n            Our primary goal, though, has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens, so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering, abuse and exploitation.\n            \n            But while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty, we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources.\n            It\u2019s a difficult problem, because we have to fight the well-financed and powerful agri-business and research industries, but we do our best to protect the animals.\n            \n            Right now, the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty.\n            \n            And that\u2019s where you can help. You can be a lifesaving \u201cfriend\u201d to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of The HSUS and asking them to become vigilant in safe-guarding the lives of ALL animals.\n            \n            Today, we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption. I hope you will visit your local animal shelter and consider adopting a dog or cat into your home. It\u2019s a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal, too.\n            \n            I also hope you will give a big boost to our work to protect all animals by sending a generous tax-deductible donation today. Your gift of at least $5 or $10 or even $15, will help The HSUS save millions of animals.\n            \n            I know you care deeply for the well-being of all animals. Please help us carry this message to others so that animal cruelty and abuse can be eliminated.\n            \n            Sincerely,\n            \n            \n            President\n            \n            P.S.

Be sure to write me back to let me know your 2001 Calendar has arrived m good order. I\u2019m sure you will want to keep it and prominently display it to enjoy these striking wildlife images.\n         Don\u2019t you agree that the lion and baby seal are looking right into your eyes? The mother elephant has a watchful eye on her young calf. And if you have ever experienced to sight of a diving dolphin, you will be brought instantly back to that exciting moment when turning to our August image.\n         Can you imagine the lion on our calendar cover being cruelly killed for a hunter\u2019s trophy?\n         Can you imagine the baby seal crying out for fear as a sealer raises his club?\n         Can you picture the baby elephant and mother with no place safe to rest and find water?\n         Many of our critics say that you and I who love animals attribute intelligent and sensitive qualities to \u201cstupid, non-feeling\u201d animals. But our ability to feel the fear and know the pain that animals experience is no \u201cerror in judgement\u201d nor \u201coverblown sentimentality\u201d\u2026it is real. It is humane.\n         The International Fund for Animal Welfare is one of the largest, most effective animal welfare organizations in the world with a special mission to save animals\u2019 lives, prevent cruelty, and protect natural habitat for wildlife to live and enjoy life in harmony with man.\n         Too, too often, man has not been a good neighbor to animals. Whether we talk about clubbing baby seals to death for their beautiful pelts, or butchering elephants with hacksaws for their ivory, or trapping animals in steel-jaw leghold traps where the pain is so excruciating they have been known to chew off a leg to escape, we stand guard for all animals.\n         All animals need a place to \u201cget to\u201d in order to be safe from bullets, cruelty, traps and clubs.\n         IFAW\u2019 P.O.

This is a new, special project that has been expanded into a permanent program.\n         Whether it is to fund additional land for the Addo elephant park in South Africa where 29 calves were born this year or our partnership with Future Generations to save vital habitat for moon bears, bengal tigers and other animals, or our response to move orphaned lions to 500 acres of protected African bush where they will live safely for the rest of their lives\u2026 we are committed to the concept of ANIMAL SANCTUARIES.\n         I\u2019m positive you agree with this most basic, humane approach. I won\u2019t even ask if you support this program. but rather, I must ask how much you can afford to support this Animal Sanctuary Fund today?\n         I do not like to ask for money No one does. But money gives us the POWER TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE VOICELESS.\n         Will you please join with me today to help save animals from pain, suffering, hunger, hunting and abuse?\n         Your gift will help give an animal a safe home.\n         Be absolutely sure, your donations do save lives. For 31 years, our name has been associated throughout the world wit saving innocent animals.

It\u2019s a big promise. And that\u2019s our vow to work hard to protect our country\u2019s wildlife and the wild places on which they \u2014 and all of us depend!\n         It\u2019s a promise we\u2019ve kept for nearly 65 years.

And\n         why I\u2019m writing you today to ask you to renew your support for the pivotal year ahead.\n\n         In fact, I want to urge you to strengthen your dedication to saving life on Earth \u2014 by sending a generous\n         leadership gift of $750 and becoming a member of World Wildlife Funds prestigious Living Planet Society.\n\n         With your increased commitment, we can move forward to thwart the most serious threats to endangered\n         ecosystems. After all, conservation begins with saving those at-risk places -\u2014 our forests and deserts, wetlands and oceans, mangroves and coral reefs \u2014 that provide a lifeline for\n         precious animals and plants.\n\n         To this end, we\u2019ve designated some 200 ecoregions, those with the most outstanding and diverse habitats, as\n         our Global 200. We\u2019re now creating model projects in 25 of these high-priority areas -- in order to balance\n         conservation with people\u2019s need to use natural resources to sustain their livelihoods.\n\n         With your increased commitment, we can intensify our campaigns to protect species that are in grave peril by\n         both the loss of habitat and the illegal trading in animal parts.\n\n         Quite simply, WWF must do even more to safeguard the tigers, rhinos, pandas. whales, and other creatures\n         that still remain in the wild. While we still have the chance.\n\n         So in addition to our efforts to conserve wildlife preserves, we\u2019ll escalate our trailblazing program to\n         find alternatives for traditional tiger-based medicines ... rescue more rhinos in Kenya and Nepal through our\n         ambitious translocation projects ... complete the first survey of China\u2019s pandas in over a decade ... and fight\n         to halt all commercial whaling, as well as the whale meat trade.\n\n         We\u2019ll also award more small grants through our Species Action Fund to help a wide range of animals,\n         including whooping cranes, giant river otters, and Tibetan antelopes.\n\n         And with your increased commitment, we can battle against destructive global forces that transcend regional\n         and national boundaries. Overfishing, deforestation, climate change, and the proliferation of toxic chemicals\n         top the list.\n\n         For instance, our innovative \u201cForests for Life Campaign\u201d establishes an international network of parks and\n         reserves. This will protect at least 10% of each different type of forest found in every country. Another WWF\n         goal? To end government subsidies that promote overfishing and to encourage new markets for sustainably managed\n         fisheries.\n\n         The challenges we face are daunting, to be sure. However, I\u2019m confident that by joining together again, we\n         can make exciting progress in the year ahead. I want to ask you, therefore, to renew your valued World Wildlife\n         Fund membership and, hopefully, at the Living Planet Society level of $750.\n\n         When you do, you\u2019ll extend your commitment as an esteemed partner with WWF -- the largest and most effective\n         international conservation group in existence.\n\n         Now, with your increased commitment, we can save more of our planet\u2019s cherished wild species and their\n         irreplaceable habitats ... as we strive to ensure a healthy and thriving future for our extraordinary natural\n         world.\n\n         Once again, please accept my warmest gratitude for your past support And please, take a moment today to\n         renew your critically important WWF annual membership. Thank you.\n\n         Sincerely,\n         Kathryn S. Fuller\n         President\n         P.S. As a Living Planet Society member, you\u2019ll receive the wonderful array of benefits described in the enclosed brochure. Plus, to acknowledge your increased gift of $750, we\u2019ll send you a free copy of our stunning coffee-table photography book, Living Planet Preserving Edens of the Earth. Please let it be a constant reminder of all you\u2019re doing to preserve our endangered wildlife!\n      \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "wwf12", "class": "letters"}

The camera zooms out as the feet stop at a set of heavy, wooden doors.\nThe camera now shows the back of a man opening the doors. He steps inside. \n\nJEFFERY CLARK\n>(Shouting)\nUncle? \n\n CLARK flips on the lights. It reveals the many stuffed trophies of\nROLAND TEMBO. \n CLARK turns the lights off and turns to leave but is met in the doorway\nby ERNST, who is wielding a fire poker. \n\nERNST\n>(Nervously)\nStand where you are, sir. Mr. Tembo doesn't have visitors, you are\ntrespassing. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nErnst? Is that you? It's me Jeffery. \n\n\nERNST\n>(dropping the poker)\nOh, Master Jeffery, you scared the blazes out of me. I didn't hear you knock,\nand Mister Tembo didn't tell me to expect you. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nI'm sorry, Ernst, I let myself in.

I didn't hear much of anything before I got on the\nplane. \n\nERNST\nMister Tembo is not in very good shape, Sir. Perhaps it would be best if I let\nthe doctor apprise you of the situation. \n\n ERNST and CLARK approach a man wearing a white shirt, khaki shorts and\na stethoscope. \n ERNST (CONT'D) \nMaster Clark, this is Dr. Tambala. Dr. Tambala, this is Mr. Tembo's\nnephew, Jeffery Clark. \n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nHow do you do, Doctor? \n\n\nDR. TAMBALA\nI am very well, thank you. I wish I could say the same about your uncle.\n\n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nWhat happened? \n\n\nDR. TAMBALA\nThere was an accident on a safari. Mr. Tembo was badly injured. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nWhat kind of accident? \n\n\nERNST\nMr. Tembo saved some bloody American's life...Oh, sorry Master Jeffery \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nIt's all right, Ernst. \n\n JEFFERY CLARK (CONT'D) \n(To TAMBALA) \nWhat happened? I thought Uncle Roland gave up hunting after that\nincident in San Diego. \n\nDR. TAMBALA\nIt was a sightseeing safari. Two of the people on the tour wandered off and\nwere attacked by lions. Mr. Tembo went after them, but the lions turned their\nattack on him. The tour bus caught up with them a few minutes later, but one of\nthe tourists was already dead, the other was hurt, and Roland was almost done\nfor. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nOh, god. \n\n\nDR. TAMBALA\nHe suffered severe trauma to the neck, back, torso, and abdomen. He is lucky\nto be alive, but he's completely paralyzed below the waist, and he's lost use of\nhis right arm. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nWhat are his chances? \n\n\nDR. TAMBALA\nIt's not so much a matter of chances as it is a matter of time now. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nCan he speak? \n\n\nDR. TAMBALA\nHe isn't talking very much; it hurts for him to breathe. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nI'd like to talk with him. \n\n\nDR. TAMBALA\nI think that that is a good idea. \n\n INT - ROLAND'S BEDROOM - DAY \n CLARK makes his way into ROLAND's room. He sees his uncle in bed with a\nrespirator mask over his face. I.V. bags hang from the bedposts. CLARK sits on the\nchair near ROLAND's head. \n\nJEFFERY CLARK\n>(Sitting)\nUncle Roland? \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\n>(Stirring slowly, attempting to move the mask)\nJeffery, my boy, so good to see you. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\n>(Helping remove the mask)\nIt's good to see you too, Uncle. I hear you were being quite the hero. \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nI told them to stay in the bus...they wouldn't listen. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nI know, Uncle, I know. You can't stop every idiot from acting like one.\n\n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\n>(Smiling faintly)\nVery true. Tell me, what does the doctor think about my condition? \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nWe're not very optimistic, I'm afraid. \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\n>(Chuckling turning into coughing)\nBloody hell, I don't feel much like being optimistic either. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nMom sends her best. I'm sure she would have come with me if she knew how\nserious your condition is. \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nI know she and I haven't been as close as a brother and sister should have...\n\n\nROLAND begins coughing hard.\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nEasy, Uncle Roland, you need your rest. \n\n CLARK moves to put the mask back on ROLAND's face. ROLAND stops him. \n\nROLAND TEMBO\nJeffery, my boy, I'm going to die. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nWe're all going to die, Uncle. Death is what defines life, remember? All of\nthose hunts you took me to. I remember what you taught me. \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nThere was one hunt I never finished. One hunt that caused more death than any\nhunt should. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nThe T-Rex? \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nYes, San Diego was devastated because I failed to make a clean kill. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nYou used what you had, Uncle Roland. There's no shame in that. \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nIt could happen again, because I didn't bag the rex when I had the chance.\n\n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nUncle... \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nJeffery, I am not long for this Earth. Please, I must ask you to do this for\nme. You must finish that hunt. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nYou want me to take the rex? \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\n>(Nodding)\nWith that. \n\n ROLAND motions with his to a brown case sitting on a chair just past\nthe foot of his bed. \n\nJEFFERY CLARK\n>(Standing and walking toward the case)\nIs that Grandpa's gun? \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nA man can only hope to leave the world a better place than when he came into\nit. I have let loose a terrible plague upon the Earth, I can only rest when the\nscourge has been eradicated. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nUncle, you weren't responsible for San Diego, John Hammond and InGen were.\nThey created the rex, and from what I've read in the paper, they created a beast\ncapable of killing the rex. It wasn't your fault, InGen started it... \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\n>(interrupting)\nAnd we have to finish it. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nUncle... \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nJeffrey, please. I regret nothing from my life except that. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\n>(thinking for a moment before grabbing the case)\nIt won't be easy getting there. \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nYou have access to all of my resources...I seem to have no need for money\nanymore. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nPromise me one thing. \n\n\nROLAND TEMBO\nAnything I can do, I will. \n\n\nJEFFERY CLARK\nDon't go anywhere until I bring you the trophy. \n\n CLARK walks toward the door, he turns and nods at ROLAND, who is\nsmiling weakly.

You\nand I have never been on particularly good terms, and I regret not burying that\nhatchet while you were still alive, but at the same time, I can't help but think\nthat your passing adds a sense of closure to twelve years of horror. Ah, that's\nnot what I meant to say...Maybe I'd better just leave it as \"goodbye\". Goodbye,\nJohn. \n\n MALCOM takes a single rose from inside of his jacket and tosses on the\ncoffin.

In retrospect, it wasn\u2019t worth lying. \n\n\nELLIE SATTLER\nYou lost as much as we did on that island, we shouldn't have deserted you.\n\n\n\nALAN GRANT\nI'm sorry, Ian. \n\n\nIAN MALCOLM\nI have to admit, I did hold it against you in the beginning, but now I look\nback and I realize that three lunatics would have been no more convincing to the\ngeneral public than just one. \n\n\nELLIE SATTLER\nAre you forgiving us? \n\n\nIAN MALCOLM\n(smirking)\nWell, I don't usually let people slide for mistakes of this magnitude, but\nwhat the heck. It's water under the bridge. \n\n PERKINS enters from behind GRANT, MALCOLM, and SATTLER. He is carrying\na large manila envelope. \n\nSAMUEL PERKINS\n(moving from the door to his desk)\nSorry to have kept you waiting for so long. I know we all have business to\ntend to today, so I'll be as brief as possible. \n\nPERKINS reads off of the envelope.\n\nSAMUEL PERKINS (CONT'D) \nI, Jonathon Parker Hammond, as my final wish request that the following video\nbe shown only to Alan Grant, Ellen Sattler, and Ian Malcolm and only to the\nthree of the aforementioned as a group of three on the occasion of my death.\"\n\n\n\nIAN MALCOLM\nJust your average \"farewell from beyond the grave\" boilerplate, huh? \n\n\nSAMUEL PERKINS\n(laughing)\nMr. Hammond hated lawyers almost as much as he hated the language we use.\n\n\n\nSAMUEL PERKINS (CONT'D)\n(indicating the VHS tape)\nBut I think this should be quite straightforward. Mr. Hammond always seemed\nlike that kind of man to me. \n\n\nALAN GRANT\n(Searching for the word)\nHe was... \n\n\nELLIE SATTLER\nUnique. \n\n\nIAN MALCOLM\nTo put it mildly. \n\n\nSAMUEL PERKINS\n(turning on the TV)\nOkay, I'm just going to go ahead and start this tape. \n\n When PERKINS turns on the TV, CNN shows on the screen with one of their\nregular programs. When he pushes \"play\" the screen goes black for a moment, then\nJohn Hammond fades into view. He is dressed in a robe and is clearly reclining in a\nhospital bed with I.V. bags hanging near him and a heart monitor at his side. \n\nJOHN HAMMOND\nG'day. I suppose that if you're watching this, the inevitable has already\noccurred. I have passed from this life to, what I hope will be a merciful\nafterlife. \n\n\nJOHN HAMMOND (CONT'D)\nI want to take a moment to apologize once more to each of you for the\ntremendous pain and hardships I put you through. Dr. Sattler, I hope you can\nfind it in your heart to forgive me for what happened in the park. I know the\nyears that followed the disaster weren't easy on you or your relationship with\nDr. Grant. Dr. Grant, I want to apologize to you for burdening you with the\nsafety of what amounted to three children on two separate islands. I know that\nthe revelation of Site B has had a negative impact on your research in Montana.\nI hope you find a way to continue your excellent work in the field. Dr. Malcolm,\nyou put yourself in harm's way twice at my request. I had no intention of ever\nhurting anyone, but misfortune seemed to be the norm on the islands. \n\n\nJOHN HAMMOND (CONT'D)\nI'd also like to thank the three of you. I thank Dr. Sattler for teaching me\nhumility. Before the disaster on Isla Nublar, I thought of myself as the creator\nof a perfect system, a god of the island itself. As it turns out, I was only\nplaying God, as Ian pointed out so well. Thank you, Ian, for teaching me that\nthere are some things Man cannot control. Dr. Grant, I want to thank you again\nfor taking care of my grandchildren in the park. What you did for them and then\nwhat you did for that family on Isla Sorna are truly worthy of the highest\npraise. \n\n\nJOHN HAMMOND (CONT'D)\nFinally, I must ask the three of you for something. I have long considered\nmyself the steward of the islands and their inhabitants, but I will not be here\nforever. When I am gone they will need someone to be their caretakers, their\nadvocates, and their guardians. I am asking the three of you to take up my\ncause. I'm not asking you because I feel you owe me anything, quite the\nopposite, I am asking you to take this responsibility because you are the only\nthree people in the world I know I can trust to make the right decisions.\n\n\n\nJOHN HAMMOND (CONT'D)\nBefore I leave you, I'd like to let you know I've done everything in my power\nto provide for the welfare and well being of the families of those souls lost on\nthe islands. I've also set up a trust fund for the defense of the islands, Mr.\nPerkins will be able to provide you with all the necessary paperwork, and I've\nretained him as chief counsel for you. Any other information you could need lies\nin the mind of Dr. Garret Wang. He was my head engineer at Site B. After the\nfacility was cleared out, Dr. Wang went to work for a firm in\nSeattle...GenetiCorp. \n\n\nJOHN HAMMOND (CONT'D)\nI'd like to say I'm sorry one more time, and ask you to consider what I've\nasked of you, if not for me then for the animals themselves. God bless you, and\ngood luck. \n\n The TV screen fades to black and then goes to static. PERKINS pops the\ntape out, and CNN rolls muted in the background. \n\nSAMUEL PERKINS\n(Turning to face GRANT, SATTLER, and MALCOLM)\nLike Mr. Hammond said, I have all of the papers for the Dinosaur Defense Fund\nright here... \n\n\nALAN GRANT\n(Looking over PERKINS' shoulder at the TV screen)\nWhat the hell is that? \n\n All four people move closer to the TV as PERKINS turns the sound on.\nCNN has a live \"breaking news\" story datelined in Costa Rica. The video camera pans\nbetween the reporter and a large footprint in the wet beach sand. \n\nMELINA ORTEGA (O.S.)\n...As you can see by the size of this impression, this is a very large\ncreature. Witnesses estimate its length at about forty of fifty feet with\ngigantic, tooth-filled jaws. \n\n\nFRANTIC WITNESS\n(in broken English)\nThe thing was laying on the beach when I woke up this morning. One of the dogs\nfrom the neighborhood ran up to it and started barking. The lizard woke up and\nmade a horrible noise. The whole village shook. \n\n\nMELINA ORTEGA\nApparently the creature's roar brought many curious villagers out of their\nhomes. When it caught sight of them, it attacked. Casualty reports range\nanywhere from a half dozen to twenty or more. \n\n\nMELINA ORTEGA (CONT'D)\n(Motioning for the camera to point toward military vehicles in the\nbackground)\nAs you can see behind me, the U.S. Marines have already arrived. Apparently\nthey were engaging in training maneuvers near the Panama Canal when word of this\nbroke. While it is not clear what the strategy here will be, it is clear that\nthey are not underestimating the threat. \n\nCamera focuses on a tank.\n\nELLIE SATTLER\nMy god. They're on the mainland. \n\n\nALAN GRANT\nOh no. \n\n\nIAN MALCOLM\nDamn it, John, you knew this could happen. \n\n Scene cuts back to the TV screen. \n\nMELINA ORTEGA\n(walking swiftly toward a group of armored\nvehicles)\nWe're being told to clear the area, so we're heading into an area the Marines\nhave rendered safe. We won\u2019t be able to broadcast a live feed from the area, so\nuntil we're clear, this is Melina Ortega live in Costa Rica. \n\n\nCNN ANCHOR\nOur thoughts and prayers for a safe return are with you, Melina. Right now, we\nhave just received amateur footage of the attack, and we're going to roll that\nfor you now. \n\n A grainy video recorded at early dawn shows a two-legged dinosaur\ntearing open a car and disappearing into the jungle. \n\nCNN ANCHOR (CONT'D) (O.S.)\nAgain, this was taken by an amateur cameraman in Costa Rica sometime in the\npre-dawn hours of this morning. The picture quality isn't good, but you can\nclearly see what can only be described as a dinosaur attacking a car. \n\nTV cuts back to the ANCHORMAN.\n\nCNN ANCHOR (CONT'D)\nOf course, we haven't seen anything like this since the 1997 incident in San\nDiego, when a Tyrannosaurus Rex created by InGen got loose and went on a rampage\nthrough the city. \n\n\nIAN MALCOLM\nIs this really happening? \n\n GRANT, SATTLER, and PERKINS are all glued to the TV when there is a\nknock at the door. \n\nSAMUEL PERKINS\n(not really paying attention)\nCome. \n\nA young Army officer steps into the office.\n\nLT. AMY BRANNIGAN\n Sorry to bother you, sir. I was sent for Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ian Malcolm.\n\n\n\nALAN GRANT\nThat's us. What do you need? \n\n\nLT. AMY BRANNIGAN\nYou gentlemen need to come with me. \n\n\nIAN MALCOLM\nWhat? Why? \n\n\nLT. AMY BRANNIGAN\nSir, my orders are to bring you to the base. \n\n\nALAN GRANT\nLook, Miss... \n\n\nLT. AMY BRANNIGAN\nIt's Lieutenant, Lieutenant Brannigan. \n\n\nALAN GRANT\nOf course, I'm sorry. It's just that a lot has happened in such a short time,\nand I think we're all just going to need a little time to put it all together.\n\n\n\nLT. AMY BRANNIGAN\nSir, I know you might feel that way right now, but I have been ordered to\nbring you with me without delay. \n\n\nIAN MALCOLM\nI'm afraid I have to agree with Dr. Grant here, Lieutenant. \n\n\nLT. AMY BRANNIGAN\nSir, there are two Military Police officer waiting in the hall and two more\noutside. I'm to place you under arrest if you don't come with me right now.\n\n\n\nALAN GRANT\nWell, Ian, it looks like we'd better go. \n\n\nALAN GRANT (CONT'D)\n(whispering to SATTLER)\nEllie, go to Seattle and find Dr. Wang. We need to know everything we can\nabout whatever this thing is. \n\n\nELLIE SATTLER\nYou think this has something to do with the incident in Costa Rica? \n\n\nALAN GRANT\nI'd bet my bottom dollar. \n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "JurassicParkIV-Scene_3", "class": "movie-script"}

If you'll\nfollow me.\nSANCHEZ leads GRANT and MALCOLM down to the beach.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ (CONT'D)\nFrankly, I've never seen anything like this. I'd wager no one has, save you\ntwo and a handful of others. We didn't know what to make of it at first, and how\nto preserve the specimen was a bit ambiguous, but one of our Marines was a big\npaleontology nut and had read all about you and your work and how to preserve\ndelicate fossils. He managed to rig something up to protect the sample from the\nelements until you could arrive to make the positive identification.\nIAN MALCOLM So, why am I here?\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ You've seen firsthand how a dinosaur\nbehaves in an urban environment.\nIAN MALCOLM If you're talking about San Diego, I can assure\nyou that this area is substantially different.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ What do you mean?\nIAN MALCOLM What I saw was a dinosaur in a highly-developed,\ndowntown area with nowhere to hide. This is a small village with dense jungle on\nall sides. It might as well be back on the island.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ But you did see the dinosaurs on the\nislands?\nIAN MALCOLM Only the T-Rexes.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ So you are uniquely familiar with the\nbehaviors of dinosaurs interacting with people.\nIAN MALCOLM Yes, but I'm sure Dr. Grant is much more of an\nasset than I am.\nALAN GRANT Scared, Ian?\nIAN MALCOLM Extremely.

Unless InGen\ncreated another gigantic predator, I'd say it's probably the\nSpinosaur.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Okay, I'll call the\nPentagon.\n SANCHEZ shouts for a soldier to set up the communications equipment to\ncontact the Pentagon and walks away from GRANT and MALCOLM.\nIAN MALCOLM Spinosaurus?\nALAN GRANT Yeah, we encountered it on Isla\nSorna.\nIAN MALCOLM Odd, we didn't.\nALAN GRANT Hammond said the animals were territorial, it\nmight be that the Spinosaur had shifted it's hunting area in the years between\nour little escapades.\nIAN MALCOLM I didn't read much of anything on your\nmisadventure on Site B.\nALAN GRANT Well, the Kirbys decided to let me have the movie\nrights as compensation for, shall we say, services rendered.

Obviously, the rights are as much yours as they are mine. I only\naccepted the offer to help fund the research we're doing in Montana.\nIAN MALCOLM A movie about dinosaurs? Do you think the public\nwill buy that?\n The conversation is interrupted by a helicopter flying low toward the\nbeach. Several Marines shout as they hurry to cover the footprint.

You are not authorized to land here, return to your point of\norigin immediately.\n The helicopter touches down on the sand and a man hops out of the rear\ndoor. He is carrying a large duffel bag and wearing khaki trousers, khaki shirt, and\na black ball cap. The man slams the door closed, pounds on it with his fist, and\npoints skyward. The chopper takes off as the man is surrounded by Marines and\nHumvees.\nIAN MALCOLM Who the hell is this?\nALAN GRANT Beats me. Where's General Sanchez.\nIAN MALCOLM\n(pointing toward the circle of Marines and the\nman) I think he's going over to greet the\nnewcomer.\n The man is now facing away from GRANT and MALCOLM.

HORATIO SANCHEZ Didn't your pilot hear the radio\nwarnings? This is a no-fly zone. No one gets in and no one gets out.\nJEFFERY CLARK There must have been a mistake, we thought\nthis was some sort of market.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ You can't be serious.\nJEFFERY CLARK Does it really matter? I'm here now, and I'll\nbe on my way back to the island just as soon as I buy some food.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Oh no, you're not. You are under arrest\nfor violating a military order.\nJEFFERY CLARK\n(noting SANCHEZ's insignia) Look, General, do\nyou really have the facilities to hold me?\nIAN MALCOLM Excuse me, General Sanchez. Mr. Clark, was it?\nWhat island were you hunting on?\nJEFFERY CLARK Well, since it looks like I'm already in\ntrouble, it can't hurt to tell you I was on Isla Sorna.\nIAN MALCOLM You were hunting dinosaurs?\nJEFFERY CLARK\n(sarcastically) No, Isla Sorna is well known\nfor its penguin population.\nJEFFERY CLARK (CONT'D) (recognizing MALCOLM)\nWait, are you Ian Malcolm?\nIAN MALCOLM Yes. Do I know you?\nJEFFERY CLARK No, you knew my uncle, Roland\nTembo.\nIAN MALCOLM I wouldn't say I knew him that well. How is he\ndoing, by the way?\nJEFFERY CLARK Not well, I'm afraid. That's the only reason\nI'm here and he's not.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Enough! Mr. Clark, you have just\nstumbled into a very dangerous area. As much as I hate it, you are stuck here\nuntil the beast is captured.\nJEFFERY CLARK Beast? What beast?\nALAN GRANT The Spinosaur.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ\n(snapping at GRANT) Dr. Grant!\nJEFFERY CLARK What about the rexes?\nALAN GRANT What *about* the rexes?\nJEFFERY CLARK They weren't on the island either.\nIAN MALCOLM How many T-Rexes are we talking about here? As\nfar as I knew there were only three. Two adults and the baby.\nALAN GRANT Right, and one of them was killed by the\nSpinosaur while I was on the island.\nJEFFERY CLARK So there might be two more dinosaurs on the\nmainland?\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Gentlemen! We can't just jump to that\nconclusion.\nIAN MALCOLM He's right. There could be a thousand reasons\nyou didn't see the T-Rexes on the island. Maybe the Spinosaur killed the other\ntwo in the interim since he killed the first one maybe they swam for it and\ndrowned. The fact is, we don't know, and we shouldn't draw conclusions that\nmight further disturb the public.\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND\n(Running toward SANCHEZ) General Sanchez, sir.\nNews from Nosara.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ What is it? An attack?\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND No, Sir, another footprint has been\nfound.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Same print?\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND No, Sir. It's smaller, Sir.\nJEFFERY CLARK What are the chances the spino's feet\nshrunk?\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Shut up, Mr. Clark. Dr. Grant, could\nthe tracks have been made by the same animal?\nALAN GRANT It's possible, where is Nosra?\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Corporal?\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND Nosara, Sir. It's about fifteen or twenty\nkilometers up the coast.\nALAN GRANT I imagine it's technically possible. A T-Rex\nmoving at full speed was clocked at thirty-some miles per hour. The Spinosaur\nhad a slightly longer gait, so I'd put it's normal walking speed at about ten,\nmaybe fifteen, miles per hour.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Right, and that would put him there\nwithin an hour of leaving here, and it was last seen almost six hours ago. It\nhad plenty of time to get up there.\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND Sir, we have reason to believe the tracks\nwere made less than an hour ago. Given the print's position and the receeding\ntide, it couldn't have been made more than forty-five minutes ago.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Jesus, forty-five minutes\nago?\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND Well, fifty minutes now, Sir.\nALAN GRANT And what's the size difference?\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND Twelve inches, Sir.\nALAN GRANT General Sanchez, I think we have to consider the\npossibility that there is a second dinosaur in Costa Rica.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ\n(thinking then sighing) Corporal, get on the\nhorn, notify all units of the second dinosaur.\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND Yes, Sir.\nTOWNSEND leaves\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ You three stay here, I'm going to call\nWashington and break the news to them.\nJEFFERY CLARK\n(motioning to his hands) General, would you\nmind?\nSANCHEZ motions for a Marine to unlock CLARK's hands.\nJEFFERY CLARK (CONT'D) What about my bag?\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ It's still being searched. You'll get\nit back when we're satisfied that you're no longer a threat. In the mean time,\nstay put.\nSANCHEZ walks off toward a communications tent.\nGRANT's phone rings. It's SATTLER calling from Seattle. The shot cuts\nbetween each speaker as they talk. > ALAN\nGRANT Alan Grant.\nELLIE SATTLER Alan, it's Ellie.\nALAN GRANT Oh, Ellie. How are you doing? What have you found\nout?\nELLIE SATTLER I found Dr. Wang. He was less than willing to\nbe helpful, but I managed to glean a few things.\nALAN GRANT About the Spinosaur, what about the\nSpinosaur?\nELLIE SATTLER As it turns out, the spino was one of the\nfirst dinosaurs bred on the island. Apparantly, there was a mix-up in the lab\nand they cloned a Spinosaur instead of a Tyrannosaur.\nALAN GRANT Great, how does that help us?\nELLIE SATTLER It gets worse, actually. The spino and the\nrexes were both prototypes for the lysine contingency, but the system wasn't\nperfected until the next set of dinosaurs were cloned.\nALAN GRANT Ellie, what are you saying?\nELLIE SATTLER Alan, the spino and the rexes don't need\nsupplemental enzymes to survive. They can make their own lysine.\nALAN GRANT Then how can we stop them?\nELLIE SATTLER I don't know, but please be\ncareful.\nALAN GRANT Thanks, Ellie. I will.\n GRANT walks back toward SANCHEZ, MALCOLM, and CLARK.\nIAN MALCOLM Dr. Sattler?\nALAN GRANT Yes.\nIAN MALCOLM What did she find out?\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ\n(walking back from the tent) Who's Dr.\nSattler?\nALAN GRANT She located the head researcher at of Site B. He\ntold her that the Spinosaur and the T-Rexes were not bred\nlysine-deficient.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ And that means what to us\nexacty?\nALAN GRANT It means the animals can exist indefinitly eating\nnon-lysine-enriched food.\nIAN MALCOLM You mean, whatever they can find.\nALAN GRANT I'm afraid so.\nJEFFERY CLARK General, I came down here to hunt the T-Rex,\nand I will do so if you let me.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Mr. Clark, I can't in good conscience\nlet a civillian go on his own when there are not one, but two, dangerous\ncreatures still running amok. Even if there weren't dinosaurs in this are, I\nwouldn't let you leave with enough firepower to engage a small armored\ndivision.\nJEFFERY CLARK Are you talking about my uncle's elephant gun\nor my rifle?\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Jesus, Clark, it's a fifty caliber\nanti-material rifle, not your everyday deer gun.\nJEFFERY CLARK I'm hunting something a little bigger than a\ndeer, I can tell you that.\nALAN GRANT Wait a minute. We still don't know why the\nSpinosaur came here, but if the relationship between the two species is the\nsame, we can assume why the T-Rex came too.\nIAN MALCOLM You think the rex is chasing the\nSpinosaur?\nALAN GRANT I read Sarah Harding's book about the parenting\ninstincts of the T-Rexes. If they destroyed your trailers because you took their\ninfant, imagine what they'd have done if you had killed it.\nIAN MALCOLM So the Spinosaur kills the baby rex and mom goes\nout looking for revenge? How would it have even tracked it?\nALAN GRANT By smell. The T-Rex was only a few hours behind\nthe Spinosaur. They could very easily have left at nearly the same\ntime.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ The question still remains: how do we\nfind them? I think it's pretty clear that we seal off Costa Rica's borders. If\neither one of them gets south of Panama, we'll never find them in the\nAmazon.\nIAN MALCOLM Considering, General, that these animals swam\ntwo-hundred miles to get here, I think it's safe to say they could swim from\nhere to South America without much difficulty.\nALAN GRANT We need to find one of them. If we find the\nT-Rex, it will lead us to the Spinosaur. If we find the Spinosaur, the T-rex\nwill come to us. First we'll have to figure out a more secure method for\ncontaining them. Clearly, an ocean is no obstacle...\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Dr. Grant, the official position is to\nneutralize the threat as quickly as possible.\nALAN GRANT What are you talking\nabout...\"neutralize\"?\nIAN MALCOLM Alan, these dinosaurs can't be contained.\nThey've overcome every security obstacle people have put in their way. If we\nbuild a better cage, they are just going to break out again and\nagain.\nALAN GRANT You know my dislike of John Hammond was just as\nstrong as yours, but he was right, Ian. We are the only people who can protect\nthe animals and the island. Their creation may have been illegitimatized in a\nlab, but their lives are real.\nIAN MALCOLM How many disasters will it take, Alan? How many\npeople have to end up as dinner for these dinosaurs before they become\nnuisances? When the good of the world is on the line, we have to sacrifice the\ngood of our charges.\nALAN GRANT How do we do that? Punish them for evolving? If\npeople didn't have a right to play God by creating them, we certainly don't have\na right to play God by causing another extinction.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Gentlemen, if you please. We don't have\ntime for a philosophical debate here. If we can contain the animals, we'll give\nit a try, but my orders are to stabilize the area using any and all means\nnecessary.\nALAN GRANT Fine.\nIAN MALCOLM Dr. Grant was right about how to find them. If\nwe can follow the rex, he'll lead us right to the Spinosaurus, but it will be\nhard to remain inconspicuous if we follow him with an army. I suggest that we\nsend one person to track him.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Any suggestions as to who the one\nperson might be?\nIAN MALCOLM\n(indicating CLARK) The person who has been out\nto get the rex from day one.\nJEFFERY CLARK Me?\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ Him?\nIAN MALCOLM If he's half the hunter his uncle is, then he\nshould have no problem. Do you feel up to it?\nJEFFERY CLARK Of course I am, provided I get my things\nback.\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ We'll see about that.\nJEFFERY CLARK Also provided that I am the one who takes the\nTyrannosaur.\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND\n(running from offscreen) General\nSanchez!\nGEN. HORATIO SANCHEZ What is it, Townsend?\nCPL. RICK TOWNSEND It's news from a village to the west.\nThere's been an attack.\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "JurassicParkIV-Scene_5", "class": "movie-script"}

Robert G. Torricelli,\nD-N.J., saying he had violated Senate rules by accepting and failing to disclose expensive gifts\nfrom a former contributor to whom he repeatedly gave help.\nOn the basis of thousands of pages of information developed in an earlier federal inquiry\ninto Torricelli's activities, the committee chastised him for using poor judgment and\ndisregarding Senate rules in his dealings with the former donor, David Chang.\n\"Your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules (and related statutes) and\ncreated at least the appearance of impropriety,\" the three Democrats and three Republicans on\nthe committee said in a three-page letter to Torricelli.\nThe ethics panel also ordered Torricelli to pay back Chang -- with interest -- for the full\nvalue of a large-screen television set and compact-disc player, and for expensive earrings that\nChang gave to Torricelli's sister, to one of his close aides and to one of Torricelli's former\ngirlfriends.\nThe committee's action comes six months after federal prosecutors ended a lengthy criminal\ninvestigation into Torricelli's activities without filing criminal charges.\nThe ethics panel, to which evidence from the criminal case was forwarded, concluded its review\njust as Torricelli is gearing up his campaign for re-election against the Republican candidate,\nDouglas R. Forrester. After months in which polls showed Torricelli well ahead of his relatively\nunknown Republican rival, the contest has narrowed in recent weeks.\nIt was the first time that the Senate Ethics Committee had voted to take action against a\nsenator since 1995, when it recommended that Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican, be expelled on\nthe ground of sexual and official misconduct. Packwood later resigned.\nSen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, who led the ethics inquiry, said he believed the\ninvestigation was thorough and fair but would not offer a detailed description of the\ncommittee's secret deliberations. \"The document speaks for itself,\" said Inouye, who said that\nhe considered the matter closed with the letter.\nWithin minutes after the committee released its letter publicly, Torricelli took the Senate\nfloor Tuesday night to apologize to the people of New Jersey for allowing his seat in the\nchamber \"to be placed in this position.\"\nDuring nearly seven hours of sworn testimony last week before the members and staff of the\nethics panel, Torricelli said that he had not taken any gifts from Chang, and that what items he\nhad accepted from the businessman he had later paid Chang for, one person familiar with his\naccount said.\nTorricelli also insisted that he had not done any unusual favors for Chang, who first turned\nto the senator in 1995 for help in winning the repayment of some $71 million he said he was then\nowed in a failed business deal with the North Korean government.\nThe Ethics Committee was unconvinced.\nIn its letter, which was signed by all six members, the panel wrote that it was \"troubled by\nincongruities, inconsistencies and conflicts, particularly concerning actions taken by you which\nwere or could have been of potential benefit to Chang.\"\nThe committee criticized Torricelli for maintaining a \"personal and official relationship with\nChang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself, in part\nthrough a pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of\nseveral years.\"\nDuring that time, the panel said, Torricelli and members of his Senate staff took a series of\nactions to help Chang, contacting U.S. government officials, writing letters to foreign\ngovernment officials and bringing Chang or his business representatives into meetings with\nforeign officials.\nThe committee did not confirm some of the most serious allegations, including Chang's claim\nthat he gave Torricelli tens of thousands of dollars in cash.\nThe committee said it had weighed the fact that Torricelli's principal accuser in the case had\nbeen Chang, \"a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the Department of\nJustice, a United States District judge and his own conduct.\" In May, that judge sentenced\nsentenced Chang to 18 months' imprisonment for obstructing justice and making $53,700 in illegal\ncampaign contributions to Torricelli's 1996 Senate campaign.\nBut at the time of Chang's sentencing, the judge, Alfred M. Wolin, also said the businessman\nhad cooperated closely with federal investigators, providing them with information that was\n\"material and credible.\"\nThe ethics committee has the power to punish lawmakers with sanctions ranging from public or\nprivate letters of admonition to censure or expulsion. In Torricelli's case, it acted without\nconducting a full investigation, saying the case had been exhaustively scrutinized by federal\nauthorities.\nA lawyer for Chang, Bradley D. Simon, said Tuesday night that he was disappointed that the\nethics panel had confirmed only a handful of the gifts he said his client had given Torricelli,\nand that the panel did not deal with what he said were actions by Torricelli to thwart the\nfederal investigation.\n\"This matter was far more serious than what the committee found,\" Simon said.\nAccording to two government officials involved in the inquiry, the Ethics Committee received a\nvast amount of information from federal investigators, some of it under a court order issued in\nMarch.\nThat information included witness statements, store receipts and other documents indicating\nthat Chang had paid for expensive items given to Torricelli, his sister, one of his longtime\naides, Roberta Stern, and one of Torricelli's former girlfriends, Judy D. Balaban.\nThe committee's letter did not mention Chang's reported gifts to Torricelli of an $8,100 Rolex\nwatch, about a dozen Italian-made suits and a $3,816 antique grandfather clock. Nor did it cite\na $1,590 Oriental carpet that Chang gave to Torricelli's former wife, Susan Holloway Torricelli.\nA government official involved in the inquiry said that evidence of those gifts was either\nincomplete or the subject of conflicting accounts by different witnesses.\nThe committee confirmed Torricelli's claims he had made partial repayments to Chang for two\ngifts: a large-screen television and a stereo compact-disc player. But it said the senator had\nshowed \"poor judgment\" by failing to reimburse him for the full market value of the gifts.\nA person familiar with Torricelli's testimony to the committee said he had told its members\nthat he repaid the \"wholesale\" cost of the appliances because Chang told him that was what he\nhad paid.\nThe ethics panel also criticized Torricelli for taking two bronze statues on loan from Chang.\nThe statues, the existence of which had not been publicly known before, were displayed in\nTorricelli's Senate office.\nFinally, the committee appeared to have discounted Torricelli's contention that he was not\nresponsible for expensive earrings that Chang had given as Christmas gifts to his sister, Stern\nand Balaban. The senator's belief \"that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you\nunder the circumstances\" displayed poor judgment and violated Senate gift rules, the panel\nfound.\nAccording to a government official involved in the inquiry, the information reviewed by the\nEthics Committee also included an analysis by federal investigators showing that during the\nperiod in which Chang claimed to have made numerous cash payments to Torricelli, the senator\nspent thousands of dollars more in cash than investigators could account for from his bank\nwithdrawals and other known sources of income.\nThe analysis, which was assembled from banking and credit records, income-tax returns and\ncongressional financial-disclosure forms, showed by March of 1998, Torricelli's cash\nexpenditures were more than $22,000 in excess of the cash he had generated from checks and\nautomatic-teller machines, an official who has reviewed the document said.\nA spokeswoman for Torricelli, Debra DeShong, said he had fully accounted for all the money he\nhad spent.\n\"Senator Torricelli provided the committee with a full explanation of sources of income and\nany funds used for cash purposes,\" she said.\nEven after the ethics committee admonished Torricelli on Tuesday night, one of his most\nimportant political supporters, Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., continued to defend\nhim, stating that the panel had found Chang \"a witness wholly without credibility.\"\nMoving quickly to make a campaign issue of the Senate letter, Bill Pascoe, Forrester's\ncampaign manager, said the findings were evidence that Torricelli had undertaken an \"extensive\ncampaign of misinformation and deceit,\" and called on him to release the sworn testimony he gave\nto the panel.\nPascoe said, \"Only then will New Jersey voters be able to decide Torricelli's fitness for\noffice.\"\n\n\n\nPOWELL IN BRUNEI FOR TERROR TALKS; BUT HUMAN RIGHTS REMAINS PERSISTENT\nISSUE\nBANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei\nU.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow\nforeign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front, in Southeast Asia, in the campaign\nagainst global terrorism. But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about\nhuman rights abuses in the region.\nIn meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil-producing\nsultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations,\nPowell said he repeatedly raised the issue. \"We still believe strongly in human rights, and that\neverything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,\" he said.\nBut at a news conference in Singapore, Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to\ndiscuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation\nand a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups. The\nUnited States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in 1999 after its forces were\nimplicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for\nindependence.\nOn Thursday, Powell and representatives of the nations of the Asian group, including\nIndonesia, are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by\nsharing information, blocking funds, tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel\npapers.\n\"We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and\ntransnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by\nthe international community,\" the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday.\nPowell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside Southeast Asia, including China,\nJapan and Russia, that are taking part in the annual meeting of the group's regional forum.\nTerrorism dominates the agenda, though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and\nhis North Korean counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, has generated the most news. It would be the\nhighest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since President Bush took\noffice.\nPowell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong\ntrip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday. He said that when he arrives in Jakarta,\nhe will have \"some ideas and some initiatives\" to present to President Megawati\nSukarnoputri.\nIndonesia is already receiving $400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training\nprograms and is to receive a like amount next year; and the United States expects to provide an\nadditional $16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism. At the same time,\nthe Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another $17 million in \"counterterrorism fellowships,\"\nsome of which could go to Indonesia.\nBut a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and\nCongress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require congressional\napproval.\n\"I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating\nmore fully with us as time goes by, and I'm quite sure that Mrs. Megawati is committed to this\ncause,\" Powell said in Singapore. He met there with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who endorsed\nthe idea of renewed military ties between the United States and Indonesia as an important step\nin stabilizing that country.\nPowell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an\norganization like the Indonesian military, which has a history of human rights abuses. \"If you\nget young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political\ninstitution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them,\" he said.\nIn Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since\n1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell\nhad proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional\ntraining center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities.\nHis brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent\nterrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often\ncriticized.\nThe United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political\nrivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected\nmilitants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial.\nPowell said his discussions with Mahathir \"touched on the case\" of his former deputy, Anwar\nIbrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials\nthat Powell said the United States had \"always felt\" were flawed.\nThe assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, James Kelly, met on\nTuesday morning with Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, for what she later told Malaysian\nreporters was a discussion about both the detention of her husband and six supporters, and the\ncampaign against terrorism.\nMICROSOFT TEAMS WITH AT&T TO OFFER SOFTWARE FOR WIRELESS DEVICES AND\nSERVICES\nMicrosoft plans to announce on Wednesday a partnership with AT&T Wireless Services to\noffer software for wireless devices and services, a person close to the talks said Tuesday\nnight.\nThe deal would be part of Microsoft's drive to sign up wireless carriers to use its so-called\nsmart phone software -- a pared-down version of the Windows operating system -- and services\nthat Microsoft is developing as part of its .Net Internet strategy.\nNeither Microsoft nor AT&T Wireless would comment.\nThe main market for the Microsoft-AT&T partnership is expected to be business customers.\nMicrosoft's efforts to persuade wireless carriers to use its cell phone operating system have\nstruggled. It has run into particular opposition from companies aligned with Nokia, which has\ndeveloped a competing software.\nBut Microsoft's potential advantage, analysts say, is its ability to link its cell phone\nsoftware to its desktop PC software, a Microsoft stronghold. Customers who want access to\nMicrosoft desktop e-mail, documents and calendar information may prefer Microsoft's wireless\ntechnology.\nIn recent months, Microsoft has announced partnerships with wireless carriers like Verizon and\nSprint PCS.\nMONTREAL TRADES FLOYD TO RED SOX FOR TWO PITCHERS\nLess than three weeks after outfielder Cliff Floyd was imported to Montreal to play a pivotal\npart in the Expos' playoff plans, he was traded to Boston Tuesday night to try his hand in what\nthe Red Sox hope will be their postseason plans.\nFloyd did not produce the kind of offense the Expos expected from him, so Omar Minaya, the\nExpos' aggressive rookie general manager, turned around and sent him to the Red Sox in exchange\ntwo South Korean pitchers and a player yet to be named.\nThe teams made the deal less than 24 hours before Tuesday's 4 p.m. deadline for making trades\nwithout first getting waivers on players. Minaya obtained Floyd from the Florida Marlins on July\n11, only two weeks after he stunned baseball by acquiring Bartolo Colon from Cleveland.\nColon has won four of five decisions for the Expos, but Floyd batted only .208 for them while\nhitting three home runs, including one Tuesday night, and driving in four runs. With the Marlins\nFloyd bated .287, hit 18 home runs and drove in 57 runs.\nThe Expos, who had a 46-41 record when they made their first Floyd deal, had only a 7-12\nrecord with him on the team, dropping from 9 1/2 games behind Atlanta in the National League\nEast to as many as 16 games back.\nFloyd can be a free agent after this season, and Minaya decided it would be more prudent to\ntrade him and get value in return than have to settle for a draft choice or two as compensation\nwhen he signed with another team as a free agent.\nThe Expos acquired Sun Woo-kim and Seung Jun-song. Kim, 24, is a right-handed pitcher from\nSeoul. The Red Sox signed him in 1997. Song is a 22-year-old right-hander from Pusan. The Red\nSox signed him in 1999.\nThe Red Sox wanted to bolster their offense. They led the Yankees for most of the first three\nmonths of the season but then slipped behind them in the American League East.\nEarlier in the day Tuesday, one member of the Red Sox organization was not sure they would be\nable to get Floyd. \"I don't know that he's that serious about moving him,\" the person said of\nMinaya.\nBut as the day wore on, the Red Sox tried harder and by Tuesday night were able to get the\nplayer they wanted for their lineup.\n\n\n\nEX-HOG OFFERS JUMP-START AND HELPS CHANGE LIVES\nWASHINGTON\nWith the barrage of crack cocaine-connected killings in the 1980s came the realization that\nyoung people were too often full-fledged players in the violence.\nThat was more evident here than in any other city, said George Starke, who after his career as\nan offensive tackle with the Washington Redskins from 1973 to 1984 stuck around and decided to\nmake this place more than his home.\n\"There was death in D.C. throughout the '80s and into the '90s, and there was death\neverywhere,\" said Starke, who was reared in New Rochelle, N.Y., and played at Columbia. \"It\nwasn't like New York's or Boston's organized crime. It was kids shooting kids. It was a\n14-year-old from R Street who got his crew of six together and ran their drug block killing\nanother 14-year-old and his crew from a block away. And from the beginning I could see that it\nwas all about jobs. I could see that you needed the private sector involved.\"\nStarke could see that in many instances these were cases of lost dignity. \"I had a young man\ncome up to me three years ago and say, 'Mr. Starke, I'm tired of going to bed at night with a\nTech-9 gun under my pillow.\"'\nAnd Starke was tired of seeing Washington and its young people suffer a black eye.\nSo, after six years of planning, he opened the Excel Institute Automotive Program, a two-year\nschool that gives people a chance at a new life as an auto technician or in another job related\nto the field. The school, now in its third year, has been so successful that it recently\nreceived a $2 million grant from Congress. The program is being copied by other cities and has\nattracted students from all walks of life, ages 16 to 68.\nThe program is coordinated with the University of the District of Columbia. Students learn\nautomotive intricacies and can earn a a high school equivalency diploma. Thanks to Starke's\nvision, leadership and fund-raising, they can do it all free.\nStarke, 54, played in two Super Bowls and won one. He played for George Allen, Jack Pardee and\nJoe Gibbs. In 1973, he was young enough to be a part of the Redskins' Over the Hill Gang, and in\n1981 he was old enough to be one of the team's original Hogs. He was recently named one of the\n70 greatest Redskins. He earned a physics degree from Columbia, became a Redskin, studied drama,\nworked in sports broadcasting, opened a Washington restaurant and built his own home here when\nhe thought he might become a developer, \"just so I could know how the business worked from the\nground up,\" he said. In 1988 he bought a Ford dealership. In 1992 he sold it to begin work on\nthe Excel Institute, putting up $300,000 to get things started.\n\"I saw a lot of kids and young men out there with no dads and no structure who couldn't read\nand some of them were beginning to realize that there is no growing old as a crack dealer -- you\neither die or go to jail,\" he said. \"My experience in the automotive industry was there was a\ndire shortage of auto technicians not only in America but internationally.\"\nSo, Starke matched a problem with a problem and found a solution.\nThe institute has a full-time staff of 18. Twelve of those are teachers. Seventy students are\nparticipating in summer classes. Forty new students are expected for fall classes and there is a\nwaiting list of at least that many, Starke said.\nAngela Nafis, 47, of Ecuador, has been in the school for a year. She learned to speak English,\ngot a driver's license and earned her GED.\nCharles Easterling, 24, said he had been enrolled for a month but lived \"wherever.\"\n\"I'm homeless now trying to find a place to lay my head,\" he said.\nStarke said the school was helping Easterling find housing. Easterling said he would do\nwhatever it took to become stable.\nJohn Orellana, 22, just got a technician's job at a Jiffy Lube last week. Not bad for a guy\nwho was kicked out of high school in 1997 for threatening a teacher.\n\"I did a lot of walking, got an interview and got a job and an opportunity of a lifetime,\"\nOrellana said. \"It shows if you have the will and the dedication here you can learn a lot and be\nsomething. It taught me maturity. This school is like a big family.\"\nEdward Jewell, 56, retired from his job as a copyright assistant at the Library of Congress in\n1993. \"I've been flapping my wings since until I found this school,\" he said. \"I needed a new\nskill. This has been invaluable, enriching. I get up and come down here at 6 a.m. every day full\nof joy and energized. I'm grateful to George Starke to have had the vision to set something like\nthis up, not just for me but for all the students. George is doing what he's supposed to be\ndoing because God is blessing him and he's sure blessing me. And when I become a technician, I\nwill help the poor and needy by giving them affordable rates.\"\nStarke said the school would move to a building near the city's bus depot in the fall. The\ncity has talked with Starke about using his students for some vehicle repairs. He is proud of\nthe red Cobra 427 that sits in the school's workshop. It was rebuilt from shell to finish by his\nfirst class and was included in the district's millennium celebrations.\nHis current class is rebuilding a black one. This one will be auctioned for the school.\n\"I just wanted to be a part,\" said Starke, who is certain he is the lone Redskin, past or\npresent, who lives in the city. He has lived here for 20 years. \"A lot of kids are afraid of\n'the process' and I wanted to take 'the process' out. For this school, once they are in, all\nthey have to do is come every day, come on time every day and work hard. A little more than 50\npercent of our kids make it through. I want it to be more, but my job is not to see that\neverybody makes it; my job is to see that everybody has the opportunity to make it.\"\n\n\n\n RARE COIN FETCHES RECORD $7.59 MILLION AT AUCTION \nNEW YORK\nThe 1933 double eagle, a $20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a\nking and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price\nfor a coin, $7.59 million, nearly double the previous record.\nThe anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States,\nmade the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan.\nEight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience\nseemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on\neBay.\nAs auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price\n\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\" said David Redden, a\nvice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer.\n\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\" he said.\nIn an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin\ndealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret\nService agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in\n1996.\nHenrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \"The\nmonies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on\nterrorism.\"\nFenton commented that the double eagle had been on \"a long historic journey, with a very\nsatisfying ending.\"\nHe added, \"I am thrilled with the price.\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804\nU.S. silver dollar, which sold for $4.14 million in 1999.\nSotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the\ncustomary 15 percent commission. \"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in\nmy 30 years in the business,\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director.\n\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly\ncoin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \"It is unique. Forbidden\nfruit.\"\nCollectors' Web sites have surged with speculation about the sale price, and enthusiasts even\norganized betting pools.\nOn Tuesday night, Redden took the podium for nine minutes before the gavel came down,\nrecognizing bidders in the audience and on the telephone. The tension in the crowd was broken\nwith a burst of applause after the $5 million mark, and a louder explosion at $6 million.\nThe rumor in the crowd had been that \"anything under $6 million would be a bargain,\" said Ute\nWartenberg, executive director of the American Numismatic Society in Manhattan. Most bidders\ndropped out after that price. The gavel sounded at $6.6 million after a Sotheby's senior vice\npresident, Selby Kiffer, made the final bid for the anonymous buyer on the telephone. The sale\nprice of $6.6 million, when added to the commission, totaled $7.59 million.\nThe auction attendance was swelled by coin collectors who had gathered on the eve of the\nAmerican Numismatic Association Convention, the largest coin show of the year, expected to draw\nmore than 10,000 people to the Marriott Marquis Hotel Wednesday. \"So the auction was almost like\nthe ribbon-cutting ceremony for the convention,\" Stack said.\nFore of the mint said the high price for the coin was reached \"because it is one of a kind, it\nis beautiful and it has a great story.\"\nThe coin was the only 1933 double eagle that has ever been legally offered for sale, and its\nMaltese Falconesque history only recently came to light, thanks to documents unearthed during\nthe five-year legal battle over its ownership.\nIn 1792, it was deemed that all gold and silver U.S. coins would bear the depiction of an\neagle, but gold pieces were issued only after a gold rush boom in 1850. They were called double\neagles because their face value was twice that of the original $10 gold piece.\nFollowing the suggestion of President Theodore Roosevelt, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens\nredesigned the coin in 1907 in high relief, forever after giving the coins the designation\n\"saints.\"\nBut in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard, and\nordered all the 1933 saints already manufactured destroyed, save for two reserved for the\nSmithsonian Institution. They were never declared legal currency.\nPresumably after being stolen by a mint employee, nine double eagles surfaced during the\nmid-1940s and 1950s. They were seized by the Secret Service and melted down. But before these\ncoins came to light, the royal legation of Egypt turned up with one at the Department of the\nTreasury, and somehow got an official to issue an export license for the coin to enhance the\ncollection of King Farouk. By the time that blunder was discovered, the coin had left the United\nStates.\nIn 1954, after the king was deposed, his coins were sold at auction and the double eagle\nvanished. It went underground until it came to Fenton in 1995. His arrest in Manhattan, after\nattempting to sell the coin for $1.5 million, led to a court battle over whether -- thanks to\nthe Treasury's mistaken export permission in 1944 -- the coin could be legally owned.\nThe double eagle came close to being melted down many times. The coin once again escaped\ndestruction when it was moved from the Treasury Department vault in 7 World Trade Center eight\nmonths before the building collapsed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.\nThe record price was seen as a gift by coin collectors. \"Many people believe that our great\ncoin rarities are vastly undervalued in comparison to old master paintings,\" Deisher said.\nIn a ceremony after the sale, Fore of the mint declared the coin the only 1933 double eagle\never to be legally issued by the U.S. government. This \"monetized\" the coin, making it legal\ntender. The buyer will receive a certificate of transfer stating just that, but only after\npaying the auction price and a fee of $20 for the face value of the coin.\n\n\n\nETHICS COMMITTEE CITES TORRICELLI'S 'POOR JUDGMENT'\nFollowing are excerpts from the findings of the Senate Ethics Committee's report on Sen.\nRobert G. Torricelli's dealings with David Chang:\n1. Your acceptance of a television and stereo CD player upon payment from David Chang of an\namount you understood to be the cost to Mr. Chang, rather than fair market retail value,\nevidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a\nviolation of the Senate Gifts Rules (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public\ndisclosure obligations under Senate rules.\n2. Your acceptance on loan from Mr. Chang of bronze statues (eagle and bronco buster) for\ndisplay in your Senate office under your office's policy of accepting the loan of home state\nartwork was not consistent with Senate rules governing such loans, evidenced poor judgment,\ndisplayed a lack of due regard for the Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate\nGifts Rule (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under\nSenate rules.\n3. Your failure to act to prevent the acceptance of or to pay for gifts of earrings from Mr.\nChang to individuals (your sister, an employee and a friend) in your home at Christmas on the\nmistaken belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the\ncircumstances, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and\nresulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule (35) and, consequently, a violation of your\npublic disclosure obligations under Senate Rule 34.\n4. Continuation of a personal and official relationship with Mr. Chang under circumstances\nwhere you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself, in part through a pattern of\nattempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of several years when you\nand your Senate Office were taking official actions of benefit to Mr. Chang (contacting United\nStates Government officials, writing letters to foreign government officials and involving Mr.\nChang of his representatives in situations where you were meeting with officials of foreign\ngovernments) evidenced poor judgment.\n5. The committee has also considered that the principal source of the allegations against you\nis David Chang, a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the Department of\nJustice, a United States district judge and his own conduct. In court documents, the government\nnoted that Chang could not be trusted. On May 23, 2002, Mr. Chang was convicted of attempting to\ncorruptly persuade a witness to give false testimony, a conspiracy to violate the federal\nelection law and four violations of the federal election law.\n6. After evaluating the extensive body of evidence before it and your testimony, the committee\nis troubled by incongruities, inconsistencies and conflicts, particularly concerning actions\ntaken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Mr. Chang.\nTherefore, the committee . . . expresses its determination that your actions and failure to\nact led to violations of Senate rules (and related statutes) and created at least the appearance\nof impropriety, and you are hereby severely admonished.\nFurther, the committee notes section 1(c)(1) of the Senate Gift Rule (35) concerning anything\nwhich is paid for at market value or returned . . . as well as your commitment to pay for any\nitem which the committee might conclude were in violation of the rules, and has further\nconcluded that you must pay Chang an amount sufficient to bring the total to fair market retail\nvalue of the TV and CD player, as well as the fair market retail value of the earrings given to\nthe three individuals at your home, with appropriate interest.

DEWAN \nNEW YORK\n\nThis 30-second commercial is the first in H. Carl\nMcCall's campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor and\nwill be broadcast upstate in major broadcast markets, and on cable\nin New York City, starting today.\n \nON THE SCREEN\n\nThe words \"His resume is an American dream,\" a quotation from\nTime magazine, appear on the screen. A series of snapshots and\nimages are then a visual resume for McCall. They show him as an\nArmy lieutenant, at his swearing-in as a state senator, as\nambassador to the United Nations, surrounded by children as New\nYork City school board president, and at other jobs, leading up to\nhis current position, state comptroller. A photograph of the\ncandidate standing in his Army uniform next to his mother is shown,\nthen the advertisement shifts to McCall talking about education,\nwhile images of the candidate looking at a computer screen with a\nsmall child and of him surrounded by children appear. The action\nthen shifts to him in an office, speaking to the camera, as the\nwords \"Experience. Excellence. Carl McCall\" appear on the screen.\n \nTHE SCRIPT\nA male voice says, \"Time Magazine called his life an American\ndream. Carl McCall, Army lieutenant, state senator, ambassador to\nthe United Nations, school board president, Citibank vice\npresident, and one of the most effective comptrollers in New York\nhistory.\"\n \nThe candidate says: \"I grew up poor with a single mother. She\nsaid education's a sledgehammer. It can open doors to opportunity.\nThat's what education did for me. As governor, I'll make sure that\nevery kid in New York has the same opportunity I had, to get a good\neducation.\"\n \nACCURACY\n \nThis advertisement is long on introductions and short on claims\nof merit. Thus, most of the facts presented are a matter of record.\nHe had the title of ambassador when he was at the United Nations,\nbut he was not the chief of the American mission. And Time magazine\nactually called his resume, not his life, an American dream, but it\nalso followed that up with a reference to his life, saying he was\none of six children and raised on welfare. As for the claim about\nhis success as comptroller, where he controls the state pension\nfunds, there is no disputing the funds' growth during his terms,\nbut some critics say it had more to do with the buoyancy of the\nstock market in the 1990s than skilled management.\n \nSCORECARD\n \nThe advertisement attempts to make several points and reach\nseveral different constituencies. For one, it counters the high\nname recognition of Andrew M. Cuomo, McCall's opponent, by offering\nvoters a straightforward introduction to the candidate, emphasizing\nhis long list of high-level jobs in both the public and private\nsector. It also emphasizes leadership, an important campaign issue\nafter Sept. 11. At the same time it gives McCall a chance to\nintertwine his boot-straps story with the broader issue of children\nand education, a priority of many Democratic voters. \n \n \n\n\nNEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS TRANSSEXUAL'S DEATH SENTENCE\n\nBy LAURA MANSNERUS\nTRENTON, N.J.\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday\noverturned the death sentence of Leslie Ann Nelson, a transsexual\ngo-go dancer who killed a police officer and an investigator with\nan AK-47 rifle.\n \nThe court, vacating Nelson's death sentence for the second time,\nruled on two grounds: that the jury could have been confused by\ninstructions on the verdict sheet and that the prosecutor made\nimproper accusations in his closing argument. Nelson, 44, had been\nthe only woman of 14 people on New Jersey's death row.\n \nThe ruling, which does not affect Nelson's guilty plea, sends\nthe case back to the trial court for resentencing. The state\nattorney general's office has not decided whether to seek the death\npenalty again, a spokesman, Peter Aseltine, said Tuesday.\n \nThe court upheld the sentence of another death row inmate,\nRobert O. Marshall, convicted of arranging the murder of his wife\nat a picnic area on the Garden State Parkway.\n \nIn its 5-to-0 decision in the Nelson case, the court showed\ncontinuing uneasiness with the death penalty, as it has done even\nsince adopting a voluminous set of review procedures in 1999 to\ngovern capital cases. New Jersey has not had an execution since\n1963.\n \nJustice James R. Zazzali and Justice Virginia Long said in a\nseparate opinion that in addition to the reasons given in the\nmajority opinion, also written by Zazzali, they believed the death\npenalty would constitute cruel and unusual punishment because of\nNelson's history of emotional disturbance. Zazzali and Long had\nexpressed similar reservations in June 2001 when the court\noverturned the death sentence of Thomas J. Koskovich, who was 18\nwhen he killed two pizza deliverymen in an ambush.\n \nThe majority opinion Tuesday said the court would impose higher\nstandards in capital cases when reviewing prosecutors' conduct and\npossibly ambiguous jury instructions.\n \nWhile all five members of the majority found the instructions to\nthe jury on weighing aggravating and mitigating factors to be\nconfusing, two of those justices wrote in a partial dissent that\nthe prosecutor's statements in his summation about the defense's\nexpert witnesses were within the bounds of acceptable argument.\n \nTwo of the court's members, Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz and\nJustice Peter G. Verniero, did not participate in the Nelson case\nbecause both are former attorneys general.\n \nNelson, born Glenn Nelson, had severe psychological problems and\na history of reclusive behavior into adulthood, and was convicted\non a weapons charge in 1988. After undergoing sex change surgery in\n1992, she pursued a career as an exotic dancer.\n \nIn April 1995, while she was living with her parents in Haddon\nHeights, outside Philadelphia, law enforcement officers arrived at\nthe house with a warrant for Nelson's arrest on another weapons\ncharge. During a 14-hour standoff, she killed a patrolman and an\ninvestigator from the Camden County prosecutor's office.\n \nShe pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to death by a\njury in 1997. The Supreme Court overturned that sentence in July\n1998, ruling that the prosecution had failed to disclose important\ninformation to the jury.\n \nA second jury sentenced Nelson to death in March 2001.\n \nIn Marshall's case, the 5-1 decision upheld a lower court's\ndismissal of his petition for further review of his 1986 murder\nconviction. Marshall, an insurance agent from Toms River, was\nconvicted of hiring a man to kill his wife while the couple were\ngoing home after an evening of dining and gambling in Atlantic\nCity. The case was the subject of Joe McGinniss' best-selling book\n\"Blind Faith.\"\n \n \n \n\nEDITORIAL: THE SHAME OF EGYPT \n\nThe New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 31:\n \n\nPresident Hosni Mubarak of Egypt describes himself as America's\nleading Arab ally. Yet his anti-democratic behavior is an\nembarrassment to Washington and an affront to his own people. The\nlatest example is Monday's re-sentencing of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a\nsociologist and human rights activist, to seven years in prison for\nhis efforts to register voters, monitor elections and report\nattacks on Egypt's Coptic Christians.\n \nIbrahim, who holds dual United States and Egyptian citizenship,\nis 63 years old and ailing. The verdict should be annulled, not\njust on humanitarian grounds but because his prosecution is an\nabrogation of the most basic standards of justice. Ibrahim's harsh\npunishment sends a chilling message to Egyptians yearning for a\nmore accountable and tolerant society.\n \nEgyptian courts are neither fair nor independent. Like every\nother government institution, they hew closely to Mubarak's wishes.\nThat is especially true of the State Security Court that ruled in\nthis case. Ibrahim might never have been tried had he not written\nan article taking note of Mubarak's efforts to create a\npresidential dynasty. Nor is it likely his sentence would have been\nreaffirmed if Mubarak believed that convicting an American citizen\nfor promoting democracy and human rights might jeopardize his own\nstanding with the Bush administration and the $2 billion annual\nAmerican subsidy that keeps his government afloat.\n \nThat aid bonanza was granted to reward Mubarak's predecessor,\nAnwar Sadat, for signing a peace treaty with Israel. Washington has\nnever demanded good governance and democracy from Cairo in return.\nIn recent months President Bush has spoken of the need to promote\ndemocracy in the Arab world. But so far he has pushed the point\nonly with the Palestinians. It is time to extend this policy to\nEgypt.\n \nWhile hardly the worst example of dictatorship in the Middle\nEast, Egypt is one of the saddest. It is a country with a long and\nglorious history, a substantial middle class, a peace treaty with\nIsrael and large quantities of American aid. Under Mubarak it has\nsquandered economic and diplomatic opportunities and relentlessly\nstifled political debate. Its official media are awash in\nanti-American and anti-Semitic propaganda.\n \nThe State Department and American officials in Cairo have issued\ndiplomatically phrased protests of Ibrahim's trial and sentence.\nThis is entirely insufficient. What is needed is a message\ndelivered personally by Bush and other top officials not only about\nthe inexcusable treatment of Ibrahim but of the contemptuous\napproach to democratic values.\n \n\n\n\nEDITORIAL: GOVERNOR PATAKI WEIGHS IN\n\nThe New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 31:\n \n\nResponding to a wave of public dismay over the first designs for\nrebuilding Lower Manhattan, Gov. George Pataki has sent word that\nit's time to go back to the drawing board. It is the right message,\nsent while it is still early enough to do something constructive\nabout the disappointing quality of the work so far. The governor,\nlike Mayor Michael Bloomberg, now seems committed to creating a\nbetter mix of uses for ground zero, and a 24-hour community in\nManhattan's downtown.\n \nWhile rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding\nschedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if the\ngovernor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development\nCorp. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. New York\ncannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its\nprocess for rebuilding what was destroyed.\n \nPataki openly questioned the Port Authority's requirement that\nany plan for the site replace all the office, hotel and retail\nsquare footage lost in the attack on Sept. 11. More than anything\nelse, that specification limited the designs to the undistinguished\noptions presented two weeks ago. Renegotiating that issue with the\nWorld Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately. Opening\nthe process to other designers, both here and internationally, will\nhelp separate this urban plan from the ordinary.\n \nThe city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens\nunderground, in particular with the transportation network. At this\npoint, planners have focused on short-term repair of PATH and\nsubway lines, with medium-range proposals being shopped in\nWashington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines\ndowntown. Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development\nCorp. and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about\nhow to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region.\n \nLowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and\nbuilding a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been\npopular with those reviewing the first six public proposals. But it\nwould be expensive, and the governor, the mayor and their friends\nin Washington will have to look at long-range ways to pay the bill.\n \nPataki's recent remarks are a sign that he understands how\ncentral the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own\npolitical legacy. Now he needs to follow through with action, to\nkeep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best\npossible plan, not simply keeping the issue on hold until after\nthis fall's election.\n\n \n\n\nEDITORIAL: A PALLID CLEAN AIR PLAN\nThe New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 31:\n \n\nPresident Bush has now unveiled his long-awaited \"Clear Skies\"\nproposal, which he promises will simplify and strengthen the Clean\nAir Act without crippling American industry. A debate on how to\nmake the 32-year-old Clean Air Act a stronger and more efficient\ninstrument is surely long overdue. But the Bush plan falls well\nshort of the only other credible proposal on the table, a bill\nsponsored by Sen. James Jeffords, Independent of Vermont.\n \nLike Jeffords, the president calls for substantial reductions in\nthree major pollutants -- the nitrogen oxides that produce smog,\nsulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and mercury. But he ignores\nemissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. That is a\nhuge omission. Even for the pollutants he addresses, Bush's\ntimetable is too leisurely. He aims to reduce all three by 70\npercent by 2018. The Jeffords proposal would make the same sizable\nreductions by 2008. Finally, the Bush proposal would roll back key\nprovisions of the existing Clean Air Act that Jeffords would keep.\n \nBush argues that the regulatory mechanisms he has in mind for\nreaching Clear Skies' goals, chiefly a market-based emissions\ntrading scheme, will be so effective that the need for many\nexisting rules will disappear. This page has long embraced\nemissions trading as an essential tool for reducing pollution at\nmanageable cost. We also agree that the law needs streamlining. But\nsome regulations, aimed at specific regional problems that\nnationwide trading alone is unable to address, cannot lightly be\nabandoned.\n \nAmong these are rules governing emissions that limit visibility\nin the national parks, and rules governing pollution that drifts\neastward from Midwestern power plants. Indeed, Bush has already\nmade clear his intention to roll back one of the most important of\nthese regulations, a provision known as new source review that\ncompels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever\nthey significantly upgrade older plants.\n \nThe 1970 Clean Air Act is a landmark statute, deserving of\nthoughtful improvement. The Bush bill, as written, is not the way\nto get there.\n \n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "20020731-nyt", "class": "newspaper"}

In return, the Brewers got backup catcher Jorge Fabregas\nand\ntwo players to be named later. By rule, the players to be named\nlater\ncannot be players on the active major-league roster.\n\n\n   In the past week, the Angels deemed outfield depth their biggest\nneed, above adding a reliever to the bullpen. Orlando Palmeiro was\nthe only backup outfielder on the major-league roster and the\noutfielders in the minor-league system are too inexperienced to be\ncounted on in a pennant race.\n\n\n   In Ochoa, 30, the Angels get an experienced major-league\noutfielder\nwho is hitting .256 with six homers and 21 RBI this season. Ochoa\nhas\nplayed in the majors for five different teams starting in 1995. His\nbest season came in 2000 with the Reds, when he hit .316 with 13\nhomers and 56 RBI. Going into this season, he was a career .281\nhitter.\n\n\n   \"He gives you a lot in all areas,\" Angels general manager Bill\nStoneman said. \"He's a good defender, he has a good arm, he plays\nthe tough right-field position and plays it well. He's a\nright-handed\nbat, which complements Palmeiro off the bench.\n\n\n   \"From a realistic standpoint, were we going to find an\noutfielder\nthat pushed one of our outfielders to the bench? The answer is no.\nHe\naccepts his role with a club and he's a team guy. He's got that\nreputation and that's important to us, especially a club like ours\nthat is an egoless club.\"\n\n\n   Ochoa will join the club today in Anaheim before tonight's game\nagainst the Yankees. He said he's fine with his role as a reserve\noutfielder and pinch hitter.\n\n\n   \"I've done that a lot in my career,\" Ochoa said during a\nconference call. \"Coming in, they've got three great outfielders.\nI\nknew that from the get-go.\"\n\n\n   Ochoa's new teammates were generally pleased with the move, even\nif\nit wasn't a blockbuster.\n\n\n   \"It's not the big, earth-shattering stuff,\" right fielder Tim\nSalmon said. \"But we didn't need something earth-shattering right\nnow. It didn't seem like we had a lot of holes to fill. It's good,\nit\ngives us something we didn't have and we didn't lose much.\"\n\n\n   --It's because of Molina: The Angels felt they could part with\nFabregas because of the play of catcher Jose Molina. Molina spent\nall\nseason at Triple-A Salt Lake before joining the major-league club\nJuly 17 to replace his injured brother, Bengie.\n\n\n   Bengie is expected to be activated from the disabled list today,\ngiving the Angels both Molina brothers on the active major-league\nroster for the first time.\n\n\n   \"I feel bad for Jorge, he's a good friend of mine,\" Bengie\nsaid.\n\"But they liked the way (Jose) has played and they're giving him a\nchance. I'm very excited we'll be on the same team for a while.\"\n\n\n   Jose went into Wednesday's game hitting .304 and had thrown out\n33\npercent (two of six) of baserunners trying to steal. Angels\npitchers\nhad a 3.33 ERA with Jose catching, better even than Bengie's 3.69.\n\n\n   \"I just hope they keep me here,\" Jose said.\n\n\n   Ochoa took Fabregas' spot in the roster, but the Angels will\nhave\nto clear another spot today to make room for Bengie. Infielder Jose\nNieves is likely to be sent down, but since he is out of options,\nhe\nwould have to clear waivers before he could join Triple-A Salt\nLake.\n\n\n   --Not expected: Fabregas, who hit .193 with no homers and eight\nRBI\nin 35 games with the Angels this season, said he was \"surprised\nand\nshocked\" to get traded from a pennant contender to a team 22\ngames\nout in the NL Central.\n\n\n   \"I understand baseball moves, I've been through this before,\"\nsaid Fabregas, who is headed for his eighth major-league team.\n\"Obviously I'm disappointed to go from a team playing for first\nplace to a team that isn't contending.\n\n\n   \"I felt like I was a big part of the team. I went through the\nstruggles last year and I wanted to be a part of it in the good\ntimes.\"\n\n\n\nNYT-07-31-02 2353EDT \n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "NYTnewswire1", "class": "newspaper"}

Sale and Pelletier declined to\ncomment on Wednesday.\n\n\n   The French ice dancers, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat,\nlater won the gold over a Russian team.\n\n\n   The complaint casts the Salt Lake City figure skating scandal in\na more serious light than the cronyism and vote-swapping that have\ntainted the increasingly troubled sport. Over the past four years,\nfour judges have been suspended, including a Ukrainian who was\ntaped by a Canadian judge detailing the order of finish for the ice\ndancers before the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.\n\n\n   If convicted of the charges against him -- conspiracy to commit\nwire fraud and conspiracy to commit bribery, both felonies _\nTokhtakhounov faces maximum prison time of 10 years and a fine of\n$500,000 or more. The United States is seeking his extradition from\nItaly.\n\n\n   The Italian authorities provided the FBI with information from\nwiretaps of Tokhtakhounov's home telephone, part of an\ninvestigation into his criminal activities. The FBI said explicit\nconversations about the scheme had been recorded between\nTokhtakhounov and his conspirators, and between him and Anissina,\nwho was born in Russia and skated for France, and her mother.\n\n\n   The FBI cited a vivid conversation with Anissina's mother in\nwhich Tokhtakhounov assured her that even if her daughter \"falls,\nwe will make sure she is No. 1.\"\n\n\n   After the Winter Olympics, a French judge, Marie-Reine Le\nGougne, was suspended by the International Skating Union for not\nreporting pressure she said was put on her by Didier Gailhaguet,\npresident of the French Skating Federation, to vote for the Russian\npairs team.\n\n\n   She later recanted and said that Canadian officials had\npressured her. The ISU later suspended Le Gougne and Gailhaguet for\nthree years.\n\n\n   The federal complaint did not describe the possibility of a\nwider conspiracy or any contact between Tokhtakhounov, or his\nunnamed co-conspirators, with Le Gougne.\n\n\n   \"We have alleged no connection between this man with any\nofficials other than with Russian federation officials,\" James B.\nComey, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York,\nsaid at a news conference.\n\n\n   He said that Tokhtakhounov \"reached out to a co-conspirator,\nsomebody connected to the Russian Skating Federation, who did the\nlegwork for him.\"\n\n\n   Maxwell Miller, Le Gougne's lawyer in Salt Lake City, said no\nevidence of organized crime influence came up in her suspension\nhearings before the ISU \"I think this situation vindicates the\nargument that we've made all along,\" he said. \"She's a scapegoat\nand a target of a corrupt system and was unfairly singled out.\"\n\n\n   Tokhtakhounov, whose age was given by Comey as 53 or 62, is a\n\"major figure in international Eurasian organized crime,\" Comey\nsaid.\n\n\n   Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and now a Russian citizen, he is\nknown as Taivanchik, or Little Taiwanese, for his Central Asian\nethnic background. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, he has\nbeen implicated in arms trading and Russian art smuggling, and in\nthe Russian news media he was accused of complicity in a plot to\nextort $10 million from the head of a Russian sports foundation.\n\n\n   He appears to have moved to France in 1989, according to news\nmedia reports, and is reported to have Israeli citizenship also.\nComey said Tokhtakhounov had three residences in Italy: Forte dei\nMarmi, Rome and Milan.\n\n\n   The complaint against Tokhtakhounov's traces his contact with\nfigure skating to 2000, when he proposed to Gailhaguet the creation\nof a professional hockey team in Paris that would provide revenue\nfor the French Skating Federation. ( Gailhaguet and Anissina are\nnot referred to by name in an accompanying FBI agent's affidavit,\nbut by their descriptions their identities are obvious.)\n\n\n   In return, Gailhaguet told the FBI on Feb. 23 as the Olympics\nwere taking place, Tokhtakhounov asked for Gailhaguet's help in\nrenewing his French visa, which was about to expire.\n\n\n   But when Gailhaguet sought guidance from a French government\nofficial, he was told that \"Tokhtakhounov's money is bad,\" the\naffidavit said.\n\n\n   The federal complaint offers many details of the alleged\nconspiracy, including excerpts from a transcript of the Italian\nwiretaps.\n\n\n   On Feb. 5, the Italian wiretaps recorded Tokhtakhounov's request\nto someone identified as another Russian mobster to get the number\nof a Russian Skating Federation official. The second mobster told\nTokhtakhounov that the federation official \"is close to us -- he is\na good guy, he will do it.\"\n\n\n   Tokhtakhounov's action apparently came soon after he said he\nreceived a phone call from the mother of the female ice dancer,\npresumably Anissina.\n\n\n   A week later, after Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze's pairs victory,\nthe mobsters spoke again. The second mobster expressed satisfaction\nwith the outcome of the competition and suggested that\nTokhtakhounov could call the ice dancer's \"mother or the father\nand tell them everything will be OK\" He appears to be referring to\nAnissina.\n\n\n   The second mobster added, \"Our Sikharulidze fell, the Canadians\nwere 10 times better, and in spite of that the French with their\nvote gave us first place.\" He added: \"Everything is going the way\nyou need it.\"\n\n\n   They also discussed the coming judging in ice dancing, in which\nthe French and the Italian teams were the favorites. The second\nmobster said the French pair had \"only three judges,\" and of the\ntwo judges they needed to win the gold medal \"one is ours, and the\nother our friends will give them.\" Their concern for lining up\nmore votes than they thought the Italian ice dancers had may stem\nfrom the Italian team's defeat of Anissina and Peizerat in the 2001\nworld championships.\n\n\n   But they seemed pleased that the Russian pair's victory was\nachieved with the French judge's vote. \"The French have nothing\nbut the ice dancing,\" the second mobster said.\n\n\n   Again, Tokhtakhounov voiced his need to have his French visa\nextended, and he said Anissina had tried to help him but Gailhaguet\nhad thwarted her.\n\n\n   Also on Feb. 12, a week before the ice dancing finals,\nTokhtakhounov told Anissina's mother in a telephone call that the\nRussian federation official \"had called me from America\" to\nassure that \"we are going to make\" Anissina \"an Olympic\nchampion.\" He told her that the Russian skating federation\nofficial \"will help -- he has two or three judges.\"\n\n\n   On or about March 7, in a conversation between Tokhtakhounov and\nAnissina, she said she would have won the event without his\nassistance because the Russian judge did not vote for her and her\npartner.\n\n\n   She also apologized for not calling to thank him earlier, but\nthat Gailhaguet had forbidden her.

No other changes.) \n By STEVE LOHR  \n c.2002 New York Times News Service   \n\n\n\n   EAST FISHKILL, N.Y. -- IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated\nsemiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than $2.5\nbillion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment\nthe company has ever made.\n\n\n   The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a\nslump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an\nexpression of confidence by the company that it can remain a\ntechnology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor\nindustry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that\nstrategy is in upstate New York.\n\n\n   IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still\ninvests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and\nmaterials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than\n$500 million a year on semiconductor research and development.\n\n\n   The factory will produce a wide range of specialized\nsemiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe\ncomputers to cell phones and video-game consoles.\n\n\n   The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in\nchip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and\nEast Asian chip producers hold the advantage.\n\n\n   \"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack\nthe high-performance segments of the market,\" said John Kelly,\nsenior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group.\n\n\n   An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory\nhere, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research\nlaboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in\nadvanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the\nlabs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial.\n\n\n   \"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as\npossible,\" Kelly said. \"If our strategy were anything but to be\non the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\"\n\n\n   The new factory, which will begin normal production early next\nyear, will employ about 1,000 people.\n\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n\n   In remarks during a ribbon-cutting ceremony here on Wednesday,\nGov. George E. Pataki said he expected the facility to generate\nthousands more jobs in the Hudson Valley area for contractors and\nsuppliers catering to the factory. He praised IBM for being \"a\ncritical partner in our economic development efforts\" in New York\nstate.\n\n\n   In a brief speech, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's chief executive,\nemphasized that it was important to make long-term investments\ndespite the current slump in the technology business. \"To play to\nwin in technology, you innovate and you lead,\" he said.\n\n\n   But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical\nbusiness. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of\nmore than $2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons\nfor the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of\nmanufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and\nclosing down some of its older semiconductor operations.\n\n\n   But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those\nproduced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \"I need\nmore capacity in that end of the market,\" he said, \"and this is\nfactory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\"\n\n\n   If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as\nboth the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital\ninvestment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings. But\nindustry analysts said the plant should be insulated from a falloff\nin one or a few segments of the semiconductor market.\n\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n\n   The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly\nto produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand. \"The\ndiversity is the big difference with this plant,\" said Richard\nDoherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. \"It gives\nIBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips,\nand the world is going to custom chips.\"\n\n\n   The 140,000-square-foot plant is a testament to advanced\nmanufacturing technology. The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about\nthe size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in\nenclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop\ndown from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless\nsteel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication.\n\n\n   Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20\ndays, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits\netched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a\nhuman hair.\n\n\n   Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors\nand fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency.\nBecause each of the hundreds of processing machines is\nself-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators\nwear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip\nplants, which looked like space suits.\n\n\n   The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon\nuniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made\nof paper. They look more like workers in a bakery.\n\n\n   Yes, said Richard Brilla, director of the new facility, \"but\nthe donuts are a lot more costly here.\" Each wafer, holding\nhundreds of chips, is worth $6,000 to $10,000 apiece, depending on\nwhat insulation, circuitry and materials are used.\n\n\n\n\nNYT-07-31-02 2338EDT\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "NYTnewswire3", "class": "newspaper"}

The Chinese and\nIndian varieties differ little in taste. Though they resemble\nsquashes, they are natives to Asia, rather than the Americas, but\nare now cultivated in many regions of the world that boast\nmoderate to warm climates. Hmong farmers grow them in\nCalifornia's Central Valley, and Mexico has a substantial crop.\n\n\n   SEASON Bitter melons can be found in Asian and specialty\nproduce markets primarily from spring through late fall. Right\nnow, some particularly nice ones are in Bay Area farmers'\nmarkets.\n\n\n   HOW TO SELECT As the gourd ripens, its color changes from\nnear white-pale green to vivid green, often flecked with yellow,\nand eventually bright orange. When young, the flavor is\nrelatively mild, with a fresh, sour note. As it ripens, it gets\nprogressively more bitter due to the quinine it contains.\n\n\n   PRICE Bitter melon was selling for 79 cents to $1.99 a pound\nlast week.\n\n\n   USES Bitter melons are used in many Asian cuisines, most\nprominently Indian, Chinese and Vietnamese. Generally, they are\nhalved lengthwise, the seeds and fibrous pulp removed and the\nflesh sliced into crescents. They are frequently blanched or\nsalted and left to macerate for up to an hour, then rinsed and\npatted dry to tame the bitterness.\n\n\n   Chinese hot-and-sour soup made with egg white and crabmeat\noften includes bitter melon. It also appears in stir-frys,\nespecially those based on pork. Black bean sauce is a favorite\nseasoning. When pickled, bitter melon makes a savory condiment.\n\n\n   In Vietnam, bitter melon halves are stuffed with meat\nmixtures, such as ground pork with black mushrooms and cellophane\nnoodles, then braised. Colin Spencer's \"Vegetable Book\" details\nan intriguing Indian chapati in which bitter melon, seeds left\nintact, is sliced, parboiled, then mixed with lightly fried\ngarlic and Indian spices, flour and yogurt.

The show, along\nwith her seminal book, \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\"\n(1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats.\n\n\n   While making light of the difference a day -- or another\ndecade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly.\nFirst, there will be all the public observances, including a\nsold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor\nrestaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues\nacross the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the\nInternational Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child\nco-founded).\n\n\n   Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both\nmembers-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for\nWine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board\nmember.\n\n\n   Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an\nannual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends,\nwho for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for\nseveral members of the group into a jolly reunion.\n\n\n   The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former\npastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a\nsenior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid\nabout her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities.\n\n\n   When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her\nlong-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the\nmove from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had\npurchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is\nin the most active of the four levels available, but should the\nneed arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within\nthe same complex.\n\n\n   \"Julia,\" explains Hersh, \"made these retirement plans many\nyears ago. She thinks it's selfish for people not to make\narrangements for their old age in good time.\"\n\n\n   But so far, age has been kind to the ebullient Child. In a\nphone interview a couple of weeks ago, she reported with glee\nthat surgery early this month to remove a small cyst on her\nspinal cord had \"miraculously\" cleared up recent problems in\nwalking: \"Turned out there is nothing wrong with my legs at\nall.\"\n\n\n   So she can once again go shopping, buying whatever seems best\non any given day. Though she had a \"nice\" kitchen installed in\nher new home, Child said it's like a ship's galley -- a far cry\nfrom the huge, three-pantry kitchen Paul Child designed for their\nhouse in Cambridge. That may well be the best-known kitchen in\nAmerica, since it became the site of the \"French Chef\"\ntelevision programs, which started airing in 1962.\n\n\n   \"Back there, we always ate in the kitchen,\" Child\nreminisced, \"I cannot do that here.\" That means her\nentertaining has been curtailed, even though she still has an\nactive social life with the many friends the Childs made during\n22 winters spent in Santa Barbara.\n\n\n   She will have reunions of sorts with her famous kitchen in\nthe next few weeks. One of its Peg-Board walls was dismantled and\nreinstalled at COPIA; the rest went to Washington, D.C., and the\nBehring Center of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum\nof American History. (all CQ) Hersh recalls the museum staff's\napproach to preserving the famous kitchen as awesome: They\ncataloged and photographed everything, from stove to windows,\nblinds to drawer contents. As reinstalled in Washington, the\nkitchen should be as we all remember it from countless TV shows,\n\"right down to the toothpicks.\"\n\n\n   Child will go to the capital for the debut of the exhibit\nright after the Maine birthday bash. To see her kitchen -- and by\nextension, herself -- enshrined in the Smithsonian, she said,\n\"will be an odd feeling\" and no doubt bring back memories.\n\n\n   But Child is not one to get maudlin about the past, though\nshe does want to keep it alive. She's already got her next\nproject picked out: A memoir of her and Paul's life in the\ndiplomatic service with his professional photographs and some of\nher collected recipes.\n\n\n   It will undoubtedly retell how the seeds of her culinary\ncareer were sown: Fresh off the boat on their way to Paris and\nPaul Child's new posting (they had met in Sri Lanka during World\nWar II), they stopped for lunch in Rouen. That lunch lit a spark\nthat made Julia decide to take classes at the Cordon Bleu, which\nin turn led to her friendship and collaboration with Simone Beck\nand Louisette Bertholle, co-authors of \"Mastering the Art of\nFrench Cooking,\" and, ultimately, to America's culinary\nrevolution.\n\n\n   For information on COPIA events open to the public, sign on to\nwww.copia.org or call (707) 259-1600.\n\n\nHow to feed a legend\n\n\nSo what do you prepare when asked to cook a birthday dinner\nfor America's most famous culinary personality?\n\n\n   Some of the country's top chefs will answer that question\nThursday at the 20 dinners nationwide that will celebrate Julia\nChild's approaching 90th birthday. The question may be most acute\nfor three San Francisco chefs preparing the long sold-out dinner\nat Fifth Floor restaurant, because the honoree herself plans to\nbe there.\n\n\n   They are the host restaurant's executive chef, Laurent Gras;\nhis counterpart at Masa's, Ron Siegel, and Masa pastry chef Keith\nJeanminette.\n\n\n   The three put their heads together, thumbed through\n\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" and \"In Julia's\nKitchen,\" and selected what seemed like the honoree's favorites,\nthough with a few twists of their own. \"It seems she loves\nsoups,\" said Siegel, \"so I am picking up on her vichyssoise.\nBut since it's the middle of summer, I am adding fresh corn to\nit\" -- plus a dollop of caviar for good measure.\n\n\n   In the same vein, Gras is tweaking her salade nicoise, and\nJeanminette is adapting her mousse au chocolat to become a\nspectacular six-layer pecan marjolaine. He could hardly go wrong.\nWhen Child was asked some years back what she would order for her\nlast meal, she ended the list with \"something chocolate for\ndessert.\"\n\n\n   Here is the San Francisco chefs' menu:\n\n\nCorn vichyssoise with caviar\n\n\n   Julia's composed near-nicoise salad\n\n\n   Atlantic halibut with flavored butters\n\n\n   Sonoma duck breast a la Julia Child with crispy pancetta and\nsweet summer onions and naturally enriched duck sauce\n\n\n   Six-layer pecan marjolaine with Julia's coffee chocolate\nmousse, cocoa meringue, pecan crust and citrus sorbet\n\nlist>   \n\nWords of wisdom\n\n\n   Julia Child doesn't have much use for fads and trends -- never\nhas. She never subscribed to cuisine minceur, cholesterol-free\ncooking, meat-free meal plans, organic food or any of the other\npolitically correct trends of different times -- and that includes\nrestricted diets, in spades.\n\n\n   However, an active woman all her life, she is aware of the\nneed to keep ones weight and fitness in mind. Here are her\npersonal rules for achieving these goals:\n\n\n\n   Take small helpings\n\n\n   No seconds\n\n\n   No snacking\n\n\n   Eat a little bit of everything\n\n\n   Drink modest amounts of good wine.\n\n\n\nWhy we love Julia\n\n\n   BY KIM SEVERSON\n   c. 2002 The San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\n   It's easy to imagine what Bay Area chefs like Alice Waters or\nMichael Mina might have to say about Julia Child on her 90th\nbirthday. But what about Bay Area notables who like to cook but\nare not connected to a professional kitchen?\n\n\n   Susie Tompkins Buell, socialite and political activist who\nco-founded the Esprit de Corps fashion company: \"When I think of\nJulia Child I think of the television episode where she's showing\nyou how to make a turkey dinner and the turkey fell on the floor.\nIt's live and she leans over and picks it up and says, `What the\nguests don't see won't hurt them.'

Some also say they must listen to their customers'\nconcerns or risk a consumer backlash.\n\n\n   The nationwide boycott of Chilean seabass is a potent example of\nthe new activism.\n\n\n   \"I have made it a policy of mine never to serve Chilean\nseabass,\" said Billy Hahn, executive chef at Jake's Famous\nCrawfish, a Portland, Ore., landmark since 1892. \"I refuse to sell\nit.\"\n\n\n   Chilean seabass, also known as Patagonian toothfish, came into\nvogue in the 1990s in U.S. restaurants and fish markets. With\nrising demand for the firm, oil-rich fish came pirate fishing\nfleets eager to cash in on its popularity -- even if it meant\nskirting catch limits and environmental regulations.\n\n\n   Contrary to what some restaurants and retailers tell their\ncustomers, the U.S. government does not consider the Chilean\nseabass to be endangered. But in some areas, the seabass are being\noverfished.\n\n\n   That is potentially a problem because Chilean seabass are a\nlong-lived species -- living as long as 50 years -- and reproduce\nslowly, said Susan Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the federal\ngovernment's National Marine Fisheries Service.\n\n\n   The NMFS estimates that in 2000, more than 16,000 tons of\nChilean seabass were legally caught from an internationally\nregulated harvest area in the Antarctic Ocean. But more than 32,000\ntons may have been taken illegally from those same waters, the\nfisheries service said.\n\n\n   Impatient with regulators, the National Environmental Trust\nbegan a boycott campaign in February called \"Take a Pass on\nChilean Seabass.\" The Washington-based conservation group says\nmore than 530 restaurants have signed on.\n\n\n   A number of restaurants not officially part of the National\nEnvironmental Trust boycott also have stopped serving Chilean\nseabass. And it's not just the white tablecloth crowd.\n\n\n   Red Lobster, with 660 restaurants in the United States and\nCanada, dropped Chilean seabass from the menu in the past year\nbecause of \"sustainability\" concerns, said Wendy Spirduso,\ncommunications director for the Orlando, Fla.-based chain.\n\n\n   Some retailers also have pulled Chilean seabass.\n\n\n   \"We've discontinued selling swordfish, Chilean seabass, orange\nroughy and marlin,\" said Mark Cockcroft, national seafood buyer\nfor Wild Oats Markets, a chain of 103 stores. \"We are also taking\na real hard look currently at almost all species of shark, though\nwe haven't made a formal statement about that.\"\n\n\n   Whole Foods Markets, with 133 stores nationwide, also does not\nsell Chilean seabass.\n\n\n   All of this comes at a time when Americans are consuming more\nseafood: 15 to 16 pounds per person each year, compared with 10.3\npounds per person in 1960 and 12.5 pounds in 1980, according to the\nNational Fisheries Institute, an industry association.\n\n\n   At the same time, about half the world's fisheries are being\nfished to capacity.\n\n\n   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\nreports that 47 percent to 50 percent of stocks are \"fully\nexploited,\" meaning that catches have either reached or are close\nto maximum limits. Another 15 percent to 18 percent are\n\"overexploited,\" and 9 percent to 10 percent have been \"depleted\nor are recovering from depletion.\"\n\n\n   The seafood industry is less than thrilled about this surge of\ninterest in ocean ecosystems from people who are not scientists.\n\n\n   Fisheries management is best left to the experts, said Thor\nLassen, president of Ocean Trust, a research and conservation\nfoundation partly financed by the fishing industry. \"It involves\nvery complicated choices that have to do with the biology of\nspecies, their life cycles, how they respond to various changes in\nthe oceans, etc.\"\n\n\n   When there's a boycott, Lassen said, \"it's not\nenvironmentalists or chefs making the sacrifice, it's coastal\ncommunities.\"\n\n\n   Rod Moore, executive director of the West Coast Seafood\nProcessors Association, suggests that activists with an agenda are\nmanipulating chefs and retailers.\n\n\n   The conservation groups providing information to chefs and\nretailers and lists of environmentally appropriate seafoods to\nconsumers are the same groups working to affect fisheries\nmanagement on the political and regulatory level, Moore said.\n\n\n   That's simply good strategy, said James Leape, deputy director\nof the conservation program for the David and Lucile Packard\nFoundation in Los Altos, Calif.\n\n\n   In 2000 and 2001, the Packard Foundation awarded $26 million in\nmarine fisheries conservation grants. They included support for\nmarine reserves and money for fisheries management reform. More\nthan $7 million was given to projects aimed at educating the\ngeneral public.\n\n\n   \"One of the principal concerns of the Packard Foundation is the\npreservation of natural resources, particularly in the oceans, and\none of the greatest threats is overfishing,\" Leape said. \"We have\nseen that raising consumer awareness and concern among restaurants\nand retailers about a particular fishery can really make a\ndifference.\"\n\n\"\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) \n\n\n   The Monterey Bay Aquarium's Web site rates different species of\nfish for overfishing, habitat damage and other factors. The\nCalifornia aquarium also created \"Seafood Watch\" wallet cards\ndesigned to take to restaurants. More than 600,000 of the cards and\nseafood guides have been distributed since 2000, said Jennifer\nDianto, Seafood Watch program manager at the aquarium.\n\n\n   Chefs and retailers around the country know they must be\nprepared to deal with customers who arrive with the aquarium's\nseafood card in hand. But in a business in which 12-hour shifts are\nthe norm, some chefs worry about their lack of time to stay\ninformed about complicated, rapidly changing fisheries management\nissues.\n\n\n   Some working chefs say they routinely review conservation group\nWeb sites, government reports and industry sources.\n\n\n   \"For me, it's very difficult to be certain that the information\nwhich is given to me is real,\" said Eric Ripert, chef at Le\nBernardin, a four-star seafood restaurant in Manhattan. \"I don't\nknow. I don't have enough information to know, for example, if\nChilean seabass is really disappearing or if it's political\npressure.\"\n\n\n   Despite being uncertain of its status, Ripert pulled Chilean\nseabass. Le Bernardin's menu also informs diners that the\nrestaurant will not serve swordfish to support efforts \"to recover\nthe species.\"\n\n\n   \"I don't wish to be a spokesman for any campaign,\" Ripert\nsaid. \"I do it as somebody who has a conscience and is caring.\"\n\n\n   JL END COLE\n\n\n   (Michelle Cole is a staff writer for The Oregonian of Portland,\nOre.

For\ninformation about becoming a client of this service, contact the\nNew York Times Syndicate sales representatives listed at the end of\nthe text.)  \nBY CHRISTINE SOARES  \n c.2002 Scientific American  \n \n    Intending to ease consumer access to mental health care, New\nMexico legislators in March passed a law allowing psychologists to\nprescribe psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants.\n \n    The state's action, the first in the nation, has the blessing of\nthe American Psychological Association (APA), which considers\nprescriptive authority a logical extension of psychologists' role\nas health-care providers. But powerful groups, including the\nAmerican Medical Association, oppose the idea and have a surprising\nsource of support: psychologists themselves, some of whom call it a\nradical experiment and fear that the most likely victim will be the\nscience of psychology.\n \n    \"I am concerned that nonmedically trained people as legitimate\nprescribers of drugs will not be accepted by the American public,\"\nsays psychologist Gerald C. Davison of the University of Southern\nCalifornia.\n \n    The APA has spent more than $1 million to help state\npsychological associations develop and lobby for such prescription\nprivileges -- or \"RxP\" -- legislation. A total of 31 state\npsychology associations have task forces dedicated to developing\nand lobbying for prescription-privileges legislation.\n \n    The version endorsed by the APA would license doctoral-level\npsychologists to independently prescribe psychotropic drugs after\ncompleting 300 hours of classroom instruction in neuroscience,\nphysiology and pharmacology, followed by four months' supervised\ntreatment of 100 patients.\n \n    Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other\nprescribers, such as M.D. psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who\nhave at least six years' medical education and clinical experience.\n \n    Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy\nof medications. Their greatest objection is to the notion of\nturning psychology into a prescribing profession.\n \n    In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind,\nmood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade,\nDavison says, has seen \"exciting developments\" that demonstrate\nthe validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the\npsychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based.\n \n    \"The timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to\nconvert it to a medical science,\" explains Elaine M. Heiby of the\nUniversity of Hawaii, who chairs a committee of the 1,000-member\nAmerican Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is\nconcerned about the medicalization of psychology.\n \n    \"Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients\ninterventions based on the best available psychological science\nshould be the APA's priority,\" argues Emory University's Scott\nLilienfeld, president of the Society for a Science of Clinical\nPsychology (SSCP).\n \n    More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP\nopponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they\nlove. They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm,\nbiomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology\ncurriculum, at the expense of traditional psychological science and\nmethodology.\n \n    Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already\nreceive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design\nand evaluation.\n \n    RxP opponents charge the APA with pushing its\nprescription-privileges agenda without adequately assessing support\nfor it in the field. The 300-member SSCP is the only group within\nthe APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription\nprivileges.\n \n    The APA has scheduled 30 minutes at its meeting in August for an\nRxP debate, but its leadership believes it already has an accurate\nsense of support for its RxP policy.\n \n    \"Except for this small vocal minority, we have just not gotten\na lot of groundswell against this from members,\" says APA\npresident Philip G. Zimbardo of Stanford University.\n \n    With prescription privileges now a reality in one state, some\nRxP opponents concede that it may be too late.\n \n    This year four states besides New Mexico -- Georgia, Hawaii,\nIllinois and Tennessee -- have pending legislation for psychologist\nprescription privileges. Over the past decade, 14 state\nlegislatures have considered such laws.\n \n    Between 1991 and 1997, a U.S. Department of Defense\npsychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four\nyears' training produced 10 military psychologists who can write\nprescriptions.\n\n \n    For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific\nAmerican News Service, visit www.sciam.com.\n (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  \n\n\n\n   EDITOR: Visit The New York Times Syndicate Web site at\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/syndicate for more information on SCIENTIFIC\nAMERICAN NEWS SERVICE and other features.\n\n\n   NONSUBSCRIBERS: To subscribe to SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN NEWS\nSERVICE, please contact the following New York Times Syndicate\nsales representative:\n\n\n   -- NORTH AMERICA: Ana Pena at 212-499-3333.\n\n\n   -- INTERNATIONAL: Claire Saint-Andre, in Paris, 33-1-53-05-76-55\nor saint-andre (at) fr.inter.net.\n\n\n   -- LATIN AMERICA: Isabel Amorim Sicherle, in Sao Paulo,\n55-11-30233331 or sicheia (at) nytimes.com.\n\n\n\nNYT-07-31-02 1112EDT \n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "NYTnewswire8", "class": "newspaper"}

He was calling bases all over the United States\nto line up their transfer to the desert outside Salt Lake City.\n\n\n   \"Where is the authority?\" asked one officer who didn't want to\nlose a valuable man under his command.\n\n\n   \"Who says this?\" another commanding officer asked Karnes.\n\n\n   Each time, Karnes said what he had to: \"Call Air Force\nheadquarters if you don't believe me.\"\n\n\n   If they continued to resist, he pulled out a secret code for\ntheir bosses.\n\n\n   \"This is a Silverplate request,\" he said.\n\n\n   Silverplate: code word for the historic mission that would end\nWorld War II.\n\n\n   Almost 1,800 men were assembled n late 1944 to join the\ntop-secret unit called the 509th Composite Group. Col. Paul\nTibbets, the pilot who would drop the world's first atomic bomb\nover Hiroshima, Japan, was commander of the unit and chose the men.\nAnd the first person he chose to join him was Karnes, though he\ncouldn't reveal the mission to Karnes. Karnes, 87, is a retired\nhistory professor who lives in suburban Austin with his wife,\nVirginia, who also worked for the 509th as a civilian bookkeeper\nfor six months.\n\n\n   Karnes was Tibbets' adjutant, the man in charge of writing the\norders and cajoling the transfer to the unit of servicemen\nproficient in bombing, mechanics, ordnance, engineering and\ncommunications. Tibbets picked the names, and Karnes made it\nhappen.\n\n\n   Tibbets hated paperwork. Karnes thought it was a breeze.\n\n\n   They were a wartime match that changed the world.\n\n\n   Japan surrendered within days of the detonation of the atomic\nbombs that killed 140,000 people in Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and\n70,000 in Nagasaki three days later.\n\n\n   The story of the 509th is a tale of an elite outfit that lived\nin a bubble of secrecy and endured the taunts of other war-weary\nU.S. units that resented sharing a small Pacific island with the\n509th, which appeared exempt from combat. Tinian Island was the\nstaging area where the 509th moved after its creation in the\ndesert.\n\n\n   Karnes has never spoken publicly about his role as Tibbets'\nright-hand administrative aide. He never even told his story to\nstudents in his 40 years of teaching college.\n\n\n   War is hell, he says, and when it was over, he wanted to come\nhome and rejoin his young family and not dwell on it. He earned a\ndoctorate in history from Stanford University and taught Latin\nAmerican history at Tulane University and Arizona State University.\n\n\n   Next week marks the 57th anniversary of the atomic bombings. As\nalways, Karnes' mind will drift to memories of his good friend\nTibbets, 87, who lives in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n\n   Each year on Aug. 6, \"I always think of Paul Tibbets and how he\nhandled unbelievable responsibility,\" Karnes said.\n\n\n   Karnes met Tibbets when the 29-year-old bomber pilot walked into\nKarnes' office at Wendover Army Air Field on the Utah-Nevada\nborder. Karnes was the personnel and classification officer. He was\nonly a captain, but he had been left in charge at Wendover the day\nTibbets surprised them by landing a B-29, a new plane no one at\nWendover had seen.\n\n\n   Tibbets had just been ordered to organize a combat force to drop\na bomb being developed by a secret enterprise known as the\nManhattan Project. He was searching for a remote installation to\ntrain bomber crews and support units in total secrecy.\n\n\n   Tibbets instantly liked the isolation and vast size of Wendover\nand the surrounding Bonneville Salt Flats. And he immediately liked\nKarnes, who showed him around the base.\n\n\n   In Karnes, Tibbets found a kindred spirit -- and a handball\npartner. Both were smart, disciplined, quiet men who thrived on\nefficiency, perfection and self-reliance. Each had skills the other\nadmired. Tibbets was a decorated, top-gun pilot, but Karnes could\nwrangle the military rule book as well as Tibbets could fly.\n\n\n   \"I don't recall ever having to tell Tom to do anything,\"\nTibbets said in an e-mail this week. \"He was so knowledgeable he\njust got things done, allowing me to concentrate on other matters.\nI was very lucky to have Tom.\"\n\n\n   Tibbets quickly returned to Wendover after that first visit to\nset up his headquarters. His first order appointed Karnes adjutant\nfor the 509th.\n\n\n   Almost overnight, Wendover became a high-security base filled\nwith off-limit areas covered in barbed wire. No one was allowed to\ntalk about what they saw or heard, even though most of the 509th\nhad no idea why they were there, except that 15 B-29s were being\nmodified to carry a heavy load.\n\n\n   Karnes and his staff read outgoing mail to make sure no secrets\nslipped out. Karnes hated to pry, and skimmed over personal\nportions of the letters. Phone calls were monitored. An undercover\nforce of Manhattan Project security agents infiltrated the base and\nbars in the little town of Wendover (population 103) to spy on\nairmen.\n\n\n   Karnes knew the 509th was preparing for a special bombing\nmission, but he had no idea what kind of bombs were involved.\n\n\n   \"I had a friend, the finance officer. He said that they had\nsplit the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb,\"\nKarnes said. \"I said, `No.\"'\n\n\n   A noncommittal \"mmm-mm,\" was the most Karnes could ever get\nout of Tibbets on matters of the bomb. By spring, the 509th\nprepared to move to Tinian Island, near Guam and Saipan. That would\nput the B-29s about 1,500 miles from Japan -- a 13-hour round-trip\nflight. Karnes was deluged with orders for inoculations, equipment,\ntransfers and promotions.\n\n\n   Karnes arrived on Tinian on May 18, 1945, as part of an advance\nteam that flew in the five C-54 transport planes of the 509th. On\nMay 29, 1,200 men arrived on the troopship Cape Victory after a\nfive-week trip from Seattle.\n\n\n   Tinian Island had been captured from Japan, and the Seabees, the\nconstruction arm of the Navy, had built two large airfields. The\n509th took North Field and stayed in relative isolation from other\nB-29 units on the island.\n\n\n   Karnes handed out bunk assignments, choosing the mess officer,\nChuck Perry, to share his tent. Karnes had his own Jeep, and went\nto the beach and to evening movies shown by other units as often as\nhe could. But at the movies, he had to remove the distributor cap\non his Jeep so the vehicle wouldn't be stolen, perhaps by jealous\nairmen who resented the 509th.\n\n\n   Not until the day before Tibbets and his crew flew to Hiroshima\nwas the 509th told what was happening. The word spread: \"This is\nit. This is the big mission.\"\n\n\n   Karnes and hundreds of other men from the 509th stood along the\nflight line as Tibbets and the Enola Gay took off at 2:45 a.m. on\nAug. 6, a warm, tropical night. Three B-29s had gone ahead to check\nthe weather at Hiroshima and two other possible bomb sites. Two\nother B-29s left in two-minute intervals after Tibbets so their\ncrews could take photos and drop devices to measure radiation and\nother effects of the bomb.\n\n\n   Tibbets got the word only an hour from Hiroshima that the city's\nweather was clear. As they approached, Tibbets braced for Japanese\nanti-aircraft fire. None came. Early in the flight, the crew had\ninserted a plug of uranium into the 9,000-pound bomb, nicknamed\n\"Little Boy.\"\n\n\n   Ninety seconds from the bomb drop, Tibbets put the plane on\nauto-pilot. The crew slipped on dark glasses to prepare for the\nblinding flash of the bomb. At 8:15 a.m. Hiroshima time, the\npneumatic bomb-bay doors opened and \"Little Boy,\" equivalent to\n20,000 tons of TNT, fell out.\n\n\n   Tibbets and his crew had exactly 43 seconds to get away before\nthe bomb exploded. The Enola Gay climbed, and Tibbets fought to\nturn the plane in the air-bending, 155-degree the crews had been\npracticing off Tinian for months. He pushed off the dark glasses\nbecause he couldn't see to fly.\n\n\n   When the bomb exploded as planned 1,890 feet over Hiroshima,\nTibbets' mouth tingled, and\n\n\n   he tasted the lead fillings in his teeth.\n\n\n   A minute later, the shock wave hit. The crew was horrified by\nthe purple mushroom cloud that climbed to 10 miles and looked as if\nit would engulf the Enola Gay. More shocking was the city of\nHiroshima, which was on fire and bubbling like tar.\n\n\n   \"We were all appalled,\" the pilot said in his book \"The\nTibbets Story.\"\n\n\n   Back on Tinian, Karnes had gone to bed. But he didn't sleep\nlong. Someone woke him to say Gen. Hap Arnold, chief of the Army\nAir Forcesin Washington, was on the phone and asking for him.\nArnold told Karnes, \"Tibbets is going to be landing in three to\nfour hours, and I want to give him the Distinguished Service Cross,\nand it is your job to write up the explanation.\"\n\n\n   \"I had no idea how you wrote up an award. I'd never written up\nany award,\" Karnes said. \"So I got all of my sergeants out, and\nthey're all digging through their (books.)\"\n\n\n   When an unsuspecting Tibbets descended from the Enola Gay on\nTinian, he barely managed to palm his pipe as Gen. Carl Spaatz,\ncommander of the Strategic Air Forces, stepped forward to pin the\nmedal on his bomb flight coveralls.\n\n\n   Karnes, like the hundreds of others gathered along the flight\nline, was jubilant. He knew the war would soon be over and he would\nbe heading home. A yearof secrecy and hard work wasover.\n\n\n   Three days later, another B-29 from the 509th bombed Nagasaki.\nFive days later, Japan surrendered and World War II was over.\n\n\n   Today, Karnes is frustrated that some of his fellow historians,\nthe ones he calls \"revisionists,\" question the wisdom and\nmorality of the bombings. What matters, he believes, is that his\ngeneration thought the bomb should be dropped.\n\n\n   \"We were not bloodthirsty guys,\" he said. \"We were convinced\nthen, and I still am, that we ended the war a year or two earlier.\nAnd what the casualties would have been, who knows -- but heavy.\"\n\n\n   \"On Tinian, and probably elsewhere, the Seabees were building\nenormous hospitals while we were there,\" he said. \"Those\nhospitals were not for us. They were for (an expected invasion of\nJapan). And then the casualties were going to be terrible.\"\n\n\n   Karnes carries the image of hundreds of hospital beds in his\nmind. In his heart, he holds the unshakable conviction that the\nmission he helped organize saved America from disaster.\n\n\n   Denise Gamino writes for the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman.\nE-mail: dgamino(at)statesman.com\n\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n   \n\n\n\nNYT-07-31-02 1845EDT \n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "NYTnewswire9", "class": "newspaper"}

That was the message delivered by\n\t\t\t\tgovernment and private security experts at an all-day conference on\n\t\t\t\tcorporate electronic espionage. \"Hostile and even friendly nations\n\t\t\t\troutinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their\n\t\t\t\town companies,\" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal\n\t\t\t\tNational Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc.,\n\t\t\t\tSilver Spring, Md. It \"may well be\" that theft of business data is \"as\n\t\t\t\tserious a strategic threat to national security\" as it is a threat to\n\t\t\t\tthe survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the\n\t\t\t\tWhite House's assistant director for National Security Affairs.\n\t\t\tThe conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of\n\t\t\t\tTechnology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and\n\t\t\t\tElectronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any\n\t\t\t\tsecret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the\n\t\t\t\tair. Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars\n\t\t\t\tfor a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR\n\t\t\t\trecorder. They need only position themselves near a company's satellite\n\t\t\t\tdish and wait. \"You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets\n\t\t\t\tat the same time,\" Mr. Matchett said, adding : \"It's a pretty good bet\n\t\t\t\tthey won't get caught.\" The only way to catch an electronic thief, he\n\t\t\t\tsaid, is to set him up with erroneous information.\n\t\t\tEven though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of\n\t\t\t\tdollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said. By\n\t\t\t\tcontrast, European firms will spend $150 million this year on electronic\n\t\t\t\tsecurity, and are expected to spend $1 billion by 1992. Already many\n\t\t\t\tforeign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers,\n\t\t\t\tconference speakers reported. Still, encrypting corporate communications\n\t\t\t\tis only a partial remedy.\n\t\t\tOne expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on\n\t\t\t\tcondition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx\n\t\t\t\tof East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase\n\t\t\t\tthe chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as\n\t\t\t\tforeign spies. Moreover, he said, technology now exists for stealing\n\t\t\t\tcorporate secrets after they've been \"erased\" from a computer's memory.\n\t\t\t\tHe said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased\n\t\t\t\this computer but that the information was later retrieved for\n\t\t\t\tcongressional committees to read. No personal computer, not even the one\n\t\t\t\ton a chief executive's desk, is safe, this speaker noted.\n\t\t\tW. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm\n\t\t\t\tthat makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for\n\t\t\t\tMikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known commonly as\n\t\t\t\tglasnost. Under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Goode said, the Soviets are openly\n\t\t\t\tstealing Western corporate communications. He cited the case of a Swiss\n\t\t\t\toil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick\n\t\t\t\tup a cargo of crude in the Middle East. Among the responses the Swiss\n\t\t\t\ttrader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which\n\t\t\t\thadn't been invited to submit a bid.

of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory.\n               Each is tentative and incomplete, pointing but not fully adequate.\n               Yet, I persistently hope, it is better to light one candle against...what? the darkness? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before?\n               There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics.\n               We are on shaky ground.\n               Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found.\n            \n            \n               We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent, able to manipulate the universe on its own behalfthe egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady, powerful flight.\n               The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom, and perhaps more than the vaunted quark.\n               But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom \"intentionality\" and \"purpose\" are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties.\n               If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more, a properdefinition of life itself, then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where \"purpose\" is ascribed by all of us to one another.\n            \n            \n               Semantics enters with purpose.\n               For this to be true, it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose, say, the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient, be conscious.\n            \n            \n               I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful, an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle, now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work, then do extract work, propagating work and constraint construction, from their environment.\n            \n            \n               Know-how\n            \n            \n               Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now, plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material.\n            \n            \n               I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had, individually and collectively, the embodied know-how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world.\n               Indeed, as I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents.\n               Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of \"jobs\" that were widely filled, the abundant niches of the bio-sphere.\n               There is in this whole self-constructing system a wider know-how, beyond the know-how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment.\n               Yet, clearly, the know-how is distributed.\n               There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.\n            \n            \n               What in the world is \"know-how\"?\n               Philosophers distinguish between \"know-how\" and \"know that.\"\n               I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums.\n               \"Know that\" concerns propositions, most conveniently, human propositions.\n               I know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese.\n               I know that the earth circles the sun, that the earth is roughly spherical, that chairs are used to sit on.\n               \"Know that\" brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world.\n               Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can \"know that\" with respect to propositions.\n            \n            \n               Unlike \"know that,\" \"know-how\" does not involve propositions about the world.\n               \"Know-how\" involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world.\n               The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest, the athletic genius high jumping, have the know-how to do it.\n            \n            \n               Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world?\n               I certainly want to say yes, without attributing consciousness in any way.\n               Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes, metabolic switching, mechanical twitching, sensing of glucose gradient, swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations.\n               It knows how all right, even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business.\n               But then, try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention.\n            \n            \n               Thank God for know-how.\n               Know that is a thin veneer on a four-billion-year-old know-how skill abundant in the biosphere.\n               But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how.\n               If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.\n            \n            \n               The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents.\n               The know-how is not outside that propagating organization.\n               The know-how is the propagating organization.\n            \n            \n               Semantics\n            \n            \n               All of which brings us, inevitably, to the brink of semantics.\n            \n            \n               It is simple at its roots, you see.\n               An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is (i) food; (ii) poison; (iii) a signal; (iv) neutral; (v) something else.\n            \n            \n               Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view.\n               The incoming molecule is \"yuck\" or \"yum.\"\n               I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent.\n               And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind.\n               If yum, then there will probably be more of this type of agent, osprings of the first.\n               If yuck, it is not so likely this lineage will prosper.\n            \n            \n               Once yuck and yum, we are not far from C. S. Pierce's meaning-laden semiotic triad: sign, signified, significans.\n               Like it or not, the glucose gradient is a sign, a predictor, of \"more glucose that way.\"\n               Granted, the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol, any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain.\n               In this restricted sense, signs are causally correlated with that which is signified.\n               By contrast, the relation between the word \"chair\" and that which it signifies, and on which I am now sitting, is arbitrary.\n               But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view?\n               If so, can \"mere chemicals\" be signs in the full Piercean sense?\n            \n            \n               I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words.\n               Consider first the famous genetic code.\n               Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein.\n               The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached, the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids, the binding of the charged transfer RNA's anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet, the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm, tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is \"translated.\"\n            \n            \n               The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules, which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid.\n               As J. Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site, the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis.\n               The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site.\n               Because of this, which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging, plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA.\n               Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon-codon matching mechanism.\n               In short, chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations.\n            \n            \n               It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign, signified, and significans to the genetic code.\n               It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling, chemical and otherwise, within and between autonomous agents, as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that \"warns\" other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites.\n            \n            \n               The calculus that is Claude Shannon's elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols.\n               Nowhere in the core of Shannon's work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning, or semantics, of the information enter.\n               This is no criticism, and is widely known and appreciated.\n               There is, however, just a hint of semantics in Shannon's view that the semantics resides in the \"decoder.\"\n            \n            \n               I cannot buy Shannon's view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent.\n               If not, then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsperhaps a set of water-filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways.\n               The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding.\n            \n            \n               But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics.\n               If only the bacterium could tell us: \"Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me?\n               I've run into that one before!\n               I ducked under a boulder, and he never sensed me.\n               I made it home.\n               Pass me some more glucose please, Martha.\"\n            \n            \n               I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories, for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and, therefore, cannot deduce that which will unfold.\n               Thus, among other things, we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds.\n               Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing.\n               I too know the risks, including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from \"intentional talk\" to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question.\n               But patience.\n               Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold, but we also cannot even translatein the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsfrom legal talk to normal intentional talk, let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound-wave forms monitored and masses at space-time lines as a description.\n            \n            \n               Then let's just be naive for the moment.\n               The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agentsay, an early bacteriumis somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world.\n               The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered, context-dependent set of causal implications of the event, or signal, in question.\n            \n            \n               \"For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the horse was lost; and for want of the horse, the rider was lost,\" more or less, said Benjamin Franklin.\n               The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.\n            \n            \n               It seems hard to ascribe purpose, in the sense of acting on its own behalf, to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga.\n               Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological.\n               After all, I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment, defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf, then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf.\n               Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf.\n               My definition is a definitional circle.\n            \n            \n               On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin's \"natural selection\" and \"fitness,\" that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world.\n               Stones and chairs are not, by my definition, autonomous agents.\n               All living cells are.\n               And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf.\n               Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest.\n            \n            \n               In short, once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.\n            \n            \n               Knowing\n            \n            \n               What about \"knowing\"?\n            \n            \n               Daniel Dennett, in his fine book Darwin's Dangerous Idea , advances a hierarchy of forms of \"knowing,\" if I may use that term, that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means.\n               I find his hierarchy congenial and informative.\n               Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher-order entities via variation and natural selection.\n            \n            \n               I do not disagree, although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution.\n               Here, in Investigations , I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy, detect those sources of energy, create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy, and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further.\n               I wonder, in short, at the naturalness and self-generaticity of Dennett's cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres, perhaps planetary geologies, and beyond.\n            \n            \n               But back to the past.\n               Dennett distinguishes \"Darwinian creatures,\" \"Pavlovian creatures,\" \"Popperian creatures,\" and \"Gregorian creatures.\"\n               A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature.\n               In its simplest version, the creature evolves by mutation, also recombination and natural selection.\n               For the moment, no behavioral learning is to be considered.\n               So one (or a colony or an ecosystem) of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us.\n            \n            \n               At the next level up, say, aplysia, a nervous system is present, and the creature is capable of stimulus-response learning, \u00e1 la Pavlov.\n               Indeed, aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimulithe later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in \"expectation\" of food.\n            \n            \n               At the next level (Dennett, perhaps properly, reserves this for us vertebrates) is the Popperian creature.\n               Popperian creatures, in Dennett's fine phrase, have \"internal models\" of their world and can \"run the internal model\" with the clutch disengaged, rather than running the model in real time in the real world.\n               This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our \"hypotheses to die in our stead.\"\n               I love that image.\n            \n            \n               Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creaturenamely, at least humans.\n               Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives, arrows, digging sticks, machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes.\n               This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how, and more know that.\n               Cultural evolution, at some point, begins to burst out-of-bounds.\n               Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran.\n               Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom?\n               Chinese cooking lands in Cuba, and Cuban-Chinese cuisine is invented.\n               What's next under the sun?\n               Who can say?\n            \n            \n               I very much like Dennett's ladder of know-how, and eventual know that.\n               Without invoking consciousness, not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject, it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems, even without evoking nerve cells.\n            \n            \n               I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations.\n               For example, bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already, for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level.\n               This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter.\n               As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus, why not envision a complex chemistry, say, very complex carbohydrate-synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves, which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism.\n               Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self-sustaining web linking the carbohydrates, the enzymes, and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus, then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops.\n               The image is not too far from how it is imagined that \"idiotype\" and \"anti-idiotype\" immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen.\n               In such networks, for which there is modestly good evidence, a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences, called the \"idiotype\" of the first antibody.\n               In turn, the second \"anti-idiotype\" antibody stimulates a third, which stimulates a fourth.\n               But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody, hence, the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space.\n               It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system.\n            \n            \n               Popperian creatures?\n               Why cannot the molecular-sensing and hypothesis-testing churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor, or not, such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by?\n               Are nerves necessary?\n               Plants, as noted, are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade.\n               There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect, just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified.\n               Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates.\n            \n            \n               I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures.\n               Even here, the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language, wherever new sentences can be created, is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole.\n               If the conversation we recent two-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another.\n            \n            \n               I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere, with its urgent diversity in which, emboldened by all our know-how, we do get on with a very rich conversation, may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks.\n               We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail, I guess.\n               Smart place, a biosphere, lots to talk about.\n               Four billion years of yammering.\n               Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago.\n            \n            \n               Ethics\n            \n            \n               And what of ethics?\n               Does a whiff of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents?\n               Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent.\n               There are deep reasons for caution.\n               Hume told us long ago about the \"naturalistic fallacy\": One cannot deduce \"ought\" from \"is.\"\n               From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued.\n               From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry, we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so.\n            \n            \n               Indeed, Hume's injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements.\n               We scientists find the facts.\n               You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics.\n               But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all?\n               Hume's injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category \"ought.\"\n            \n            \n               The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous.\n               Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances.\n               \"It is wrong to kill.\"\n               Becomes, \"Agggah!\"\n               Does the positivist argument seem persuasive?\n               It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, \"only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful,\" is itself not empirically verifiable.\n               One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards.\n            \n            \n               John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all \"contractually\" agree to, were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments.\n               Thus \"equality before the law\" is one contract that Rawls commends to us.\n               \"Equality before the law\" is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium.\n               The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue.\n            \n            \n               I will content myself with wondering where \"value\" and the rudiments of \"intentionality\" come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts.\n               Where is the place of value in a world of fact?\n            \n            \n               So, a short soliloquy.\n               Facts are know-that statements.\n               But know-how preceded know that.\n               While fully aware of Hume's injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent's perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent.\n               I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria.\n               Too much yuck, this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere.\n               Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli , or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around.\n            \n            \n               And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?\n               If so, another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid.\n               Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible.\n               You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control.\n               To act ethically, you must first be able to act at all.\n            \n            \n               But what are \"acts\" in the first place?\n               Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician.\n               Now entering Harvard, Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive, after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard, where, at age fourteen, Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands.\n               Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the \"doings\" of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent.\n               Note we say the E. coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner.\n               But all sorts of molecular vibrational, rotational, and translational motions are occurring.\n               What are actions and what are mere happenings?\n            \n            \n               I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics.\n               But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings, Dan's happy phrasing, is relevant for E. coli , tigers, us, trees, and autonomous agents in general.\n               We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism.\n            \n            \n               Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise?\n               Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier, yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics, intentionality, value, and ethics arise with autonomous agents.\n               I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Hume's naturalistic fallacy.\n               We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents.\n            \n         \n      \n   \n", "mode": "written", "name": "ch5", "class": "non-fiction"}

In Chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos of the 1940s. The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs, long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads, thick-soled shoes, and long watch chains dangling from the belt. An addition to the whole style common to Chicanos was a particular haircut, long with a ducktail and a wide-brimmed hat.\nThe word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem, and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style. Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing, the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders, that later became known as the zoot suit. In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, he describes the zoot--suiters\u2019 style, \u201cwalking slowly, their shoulders swaying, their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men\u201d (1947, 380). In the late-night jazz scenes of Harlem this style was \u201ca killer-diller coat with a drape-shape, reat-pleats and shoulders padded like a lunatic\u2019s cell\u201d (380). Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume, which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing. The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth, and the finger-tipped coat was made for fun and leisure. The long baggy pants were made for dancing, especially the jitterbug, and the wide Panama hats were another sign of adulthood. \u201cThe business of fun, dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by Zoot-Suiters. It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of free-wheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture\u201d (Tyler, 23). Prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit, such as Cab Calloway, Sammy Davis Jr., and Duke Ellington. Ellington performed at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in 1941 and 1942 with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits, also known as Gone with the Wind suits, after the style worn by Clark Gable in the movie by the same name.\nEven though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities, it is primarily identified with the pachucos of Los Angeles. Pachucos were mostly second-generation Mexicans, the sons of migrant laborers and working-class immigrants. Pachucos created their own subculture, an arrogant style of dressing, a bilingual secret argot, and for some individuals membership in petty criminal gangs. The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zoot-suiter as neither a Mexican nor an American. It was not a bicultural or binational position, but rather a position between cultures, a \u201changing in space\u201d position. The overly confident, slow swagger of the pachuco, today exemplified by the cholo, made it appear in fact as if the zoot-suiter were walking on air.\nDuring the summer of 1943 the attention of the whole country was on Los Angeles when gangs of sailors and zoot-suiters battled with each other in the streets of the city. It is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked, beat, and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zoot-suiters. Between the third and thirteenth of June zoot-suiters were open targets. Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectives.\nDuring the late 1970s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by Luis Valdez. In 1981 a film by the same name, Zoot Suit, was produced and directed by Luis Valdez, with performances by actors Daniel Valdez and Edward James Olmos.\nSee also Cholos; Pachucos\nReferences Barker 1950; Cosgrove 1989; Ellison, 1947; Mazon 1984; Orona-Cordova 1992; Sanchez 1978; Stone 1990; Tyler 1994; Valdez 1992; Zoot Suit 1981\nZozobra\nA giant, forty-foot effigy in the form of a puppet, which is burned during the annual Santa Fe Fiesta held in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The word Zozobra translates to \u201cgloom\u201d or \u201cworry\u201d or \u201canguished.\u201d The Zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta, which symbolizes the end of destructiveness, gloom, and worry, setting the tone for a successful fiesta. The creation of Zozobra was introduced into the fiesta in 1926 by Will Shuster, who felt that the fiesta had become \u201cdull and commercialized.\u201d Throughout the years the image of Zozobra changed from a simple twenty-foot puppet to the elaborate forty-foot figure with animated eyes, arms, and mouth that he is today. In 1969 Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe. He is hung on a tall pole on a hill, outside the city, where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch. The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happiness.\nIn response to the tradition of the burning of Zozobra, a group of New Mexico Chicanos started a tradition of burning El Kooko\u00f3ee, a figure known by many Chicanos as the bogeyman, during the Festival de Oto\u00f1o.\nSee also El Kooko\u00f3ee; Santa Fe Fiesta\nReferences Cohen 1985; Grimes 1976; Weigle and White 1988\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "chZ", "class": "non-fiction"}

This background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow. \n\nTypes of deformation\n\nThe surficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. The displacement can be seismic and associated with earthquakes and abrupt faulting, or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor. Faults may be lateral faults that displace or offset the channel (Figure 2.1A) without vertical displacement. This type of displacement should be easily recognized. Faults with vertical displacement may have the uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is steepened (Figure 2.1B). In the opposite case, the gradient will be decreased (Figure 2.1C). The effect will resemble monoclinal tilting (Figure 2.1F, G). Pairs of faults may produce uplifted (horst) or downdropped blocks (graben) that will both steepen and reduce gradient (Figure 2.1D, E). This has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and synclines (Figure 2.1H, I). \n\nIn addition to all of these structural features, the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain (Figure 2.1J, K, L). The possibilities are great, but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or cross-valley tilting. \n\nStreams respond to vertical displacement along faults (Figure 2.1B and C) by aggradation or degradation. When the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient (Figure 2.1B), erosion will be initiated in this reach. When the displacement produces a channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream (Figure 2.1C), aggradation will occur. Even small displacements may be sufficient to induce aggradation or degradation of large streams. If the displacement forms a dam (Figure 2.1C), the stream will be blocked, and it will flow along the fault or form a lake. Wallace (1968) mentioned that even a few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream side of a fault can produce a dam across a small stream, which can divert its course. \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.1 Surface deformation by faulting, folding, and lateral tilting. Plan view on left; cross-section on right (from Ouchi, 1983) small arrows indicate direction of flow. Large arrows indicate direction of movement. The displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated. \n\nHorst and graben (Figure 2.1D and E) combine two different types of vertical displacement (Figure 2.1B and C). There will be aggradation upstream from the horst, and degradation, which will migrate upstream, on the downstream part of the horst. Reduced sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation. Upstream of the graben, there will be degradation and aggradation in the graben itself. A river in such a location will be unstable, as Cartier and Alt (1982) suggested for the Bitterroot River in Montana. \n\nThe type of folding (Figure 2.1) will affect a river similar to the various types of faulting, but changes will probably be less abrupt. The effects of tilting will depend upon the amount, but in the simplest case, steepening of a valley will cause degradation (Figure 2.1K) and a reverse tilt (Figure 2.1L) will cause deposition. Lateral tilting will cause channel shift downdip (Figure 2.1J) or avulsion. \n\nFigure 2.1 shows only simple, but exaggerated cases, whereas actual displacements can be more complicated. For example, faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction. Fault displacements of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious, and its influence on alluvial rivers can be observed. For example, small stream channels have been offset by strike-slip movement (Figures 1.8, 2.1A) of the San Andreas fault. Wallace (1968) pointed out that the offset of a stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes. The main reason why channel offset caused by the San Andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault (20.3 mm/year, Brown and Wallace, 1968) and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault. While fault displacements are obvious, movements of the land surface by folding can be slow. However, this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behavior. For example, concentration of erosion along only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt (Jefferson, 1907; Nanson, 1980a; Leeder and Alexander, 1987). \n\nTypes of alluvial rivers\n\nIt is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently to deformation; therefore, their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can be evaluated. This can best be done by discussing a simple classification of alluvial channels that is based on type of sediment load and pattern. \n\nFive basic channel patterns exist (Figure 2.2): (1) straight channels with either migrating sand waves; or (2) with migrating alternate bars forming a sinuous thalweg; (3) two types of meandering channels, a highly sinuous channel of equal width (pattern 3a) and channels that are wider at bends than in crossings (pattern 3b); (4) the meandering\u2013braided transition; and (5) a typical braided stream. The relative stability of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels, as related to relative sediment size, load, velocity of flow, and stream power, are also indicated in Figure 2.2. It has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying the gradient, sediment load, stream power, and the type of sediment load transported by the channel (Schumm and Kahn, 1972). Therefore, alluvial channels have also been classified according to the type of sediment load moving through the channels, as suspended-load, mixed-load, and bed-load channels (Figure 2.2). Water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel (width, depth, meander dimensions), but the relative proportions of bed load (sand and gravel) and suspended load (silts and clays) determine not only the shape of the channel but width\u2013depth ratio and channel pattern. A suspended-load channel has been defined as one that transports less than 3 percent bed load and a bed-load channel as one transporting more than 11 percent bed load (Schumm, 1977). The mixed-load channel lies between these two (Figure 2.2). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.2 Channel classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated variables and relative stability indicated (Schumm, 1981). \n\nAlluvial rivers that transport clay, silt, sand, and gravel, can be placed within these three general categories. However, within the meandering-stream group there is considerable range of sinuosity (1.25 to 3.0). In addition, in the braided-stream category, there are bar-braided and island-braided channels (islands are vegetated bars). \n\nFigure 2.2 suggests that the range of channels from straight to braided forms a continuum, but experimental work and field studies have indicated that the changes of pattern between braided, meandering, and straight, occur relatively abruptly at river-pattern thresholds (Figure 2.3). The pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power, gradient, and sediment load (Schumm and Kahn, 1972). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.3 Relation between flume slope and sinuosity during experiments at constant water discharge. Sediment load, stream power, velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables (from Schumm and Khan, 1972). \n\nAlthough the five patterns of Figure 2.2 involve all three river types, there are five basic bed-load channel patterns (Figure 2.4A) that have been recognized during experimental studies of channel patterns (Schumm, 1977, p. 158). These five basic bed-load channel patterns can be extended to mixed-load and suspended-load channels to produce 13 river patterns (Figure 2.4). Patterns 1\u20135 are bed-load channel patterns, patterns 6\u201310 are mixed-load channel patterns, and patterns 11\u201313 are suspended-load channel patterns. Figure 2.4 attempts to show sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change with increasing valley slope, stream power and sediment load for each channel type. The three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load, but within each type, the different patterns reflect increased valley slope, sediment load, and stream power. \n\nThe different bed-load channel patterns (Figure 2.4) can be described as follows: Pattern 1, straight, essentially equal-width channel with migrating sand waves. Pattern 2, alternate-bar channel with migrating side or alternate bars and a slightly sinuous thalweg; Pattern 3, low-sinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes; Pattern 4, transitional meandering-thalweg braided channel. The large alternate bars or point bars have been dissected by chutes, but a meandering thalweg can be identified. Pattern 5 is a typical bar-braided channel. \n\nAs compared to the bed-load channels, the five mixed-load channels (Figure 2.4B) are relatively narrower and deeper, and there is greater bank stability. The higher degree of bank stability permits the maintenance of narrow, deep, straight channels (Pattern 6), and alternate bars stabilize because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels (Pattern 7). Pattern 8 is a truly meandering channel, wide on the bends, relatively narrow at the crossings, and subject to chute cutoffs. Pattern 9 maintains the sinuosity of a meandering channel, but with a greater sediment transport the presence of bars gives it a composite sinuous-braided appearance. Pattern 10 is a braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of bed-load channel 5, and it is likely to be island-braided. \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.4 The range of alluvial channel patterns for the three channel types: (A) bed-load channel patterns, (B) mixed-load channel patterns, (C) suspended-load channel patterns (from Schumm, 1981). \n\n\nSuspended-load channels (Figure 2.4C) are narrow and deeper than mixed-load channels. Suspended load Pattern 11 is a straight, narrow, deep channel. With only small quantities of bed load, this type of channel may have the highest sinuosity of all (Patterns 12 and 13). \n\nRivers may undergo a metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely. That is, a suspended-load channel (Pattern 12) could become braided (Pattern 5), or a braided channel (Pattern 5) could become meandering (Pattern 8 or 12), etc., when there is a sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel. Therefore, the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common, as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions, or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics. \n\nThere is an additional channel pattern that spans the range of stream types of Figure 2.4. This is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments (Schumm et al., 1996). The channel segments can be straight, meandering, or braided, and they appear to span the range of channel types. Anastomosing or anabranching channels differ from braided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by a floodplain (Figure 2.5), whereas braided channels have multiple thalwegs in a single channel. Knighton and Nanson (1993) and Richards et al. (1993) suggest that this pattern is transitioned to a single channel because anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys (Smith and Smith, 1980) and tectonic uplift (Gregory and Schumm, 1987). Reduced gradient from whatever cause appears to be important, and therefore, anastomosing reaches of a river can be evidence of tectonic activity. \n\nEvidence of deformation \n\nThe first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landforms that result from long-continued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces. These obvious features are in contrast to the more subtle changes of alluvial rivers. \n\nDrainage networks\n\nThe arrangement of streams and tributaries into a drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops, climate, and the erodibility of the surface material. Local variations in both slope and materials will cause variations in the drainage pattern (Figure 1.2). For example, experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about 2.5 percent, whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes (Phillips and Schumm, 1987). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.5 Map of anastomosing channels of Ovens and King Rivers. Numbers indicate relative ages of channels and reaches of channels from youngest (1) to oldest (4) (from Schumm et al., 1996). \n\nLocal variations in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage patterns. A topographic high caused by active uplift, will cause a deflection of portions of the drainage pattern. For instance, on the upslope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope. This can cause portions of the drainage pattern to develop in a direction opposite to that of the drainage network. An uplift may also deflect portions of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope (Figure 2.6). As the major streams are deflected away from the uplift, tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened. \n\nChanges of an entire drainage network, as a result of tilting, are described by Sparling (1967) who notes that isostatic adjustment in Ottawa County, Ohio has increased the gradient of some streams and decreased the gradient of others. Incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as a result of reduced gradient. Russell (1939) described various drainage patterns found in the flat alluvial lands of Louisiana, and he recognized a network pattern of poorly developed drainage channels that was converted to a dendritic pattern, as a result of tilting and steepening of the gradient. \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.6 Drainage pattern modified by uplift. \n\nPrice and Whetstone (1977) used asymmetric river and valley cross-section profiles, as evidence for movement along the Chattahoochee Embayment in Florida. Subsidence caused southward migration of east\u2013west flowing channels. South-flowing streams exhibit paired terraces while east\u2013west trending streams contain extensive terraces on the northern side with few or no terraces on the steeper southern margin. Subsidence in the Chattahoochee Embayment and adjacent warping along the Chattahoochee Uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the Chattahoochee River. \n\nLong-continued tilting in a cross-valley direction will cause lateral erosion and the development of an asymmetrical valley and drainage network. Muehlberger (1979) noted this type of asymmetry in an area near Taos, New Mexico (Figure 2.7). Using 71\u2044minute U.S. Geological Survey topographic\n\n2 maps, he described this asymmetry quantitatively. By selecting a contour on the valley wall and measuring the distance from the stream to this contour in a down-tilt direction (Dd) and in the opposite, uptilt direction (Du) an index of asymmetry was developed (Dd/Du) (Figure 2.7). The index for 30 small drainage basins was 0.6 indicating a major displacement of the main channel in a down-tilt direction. Cox (1994) used a somewhat different index to demonstrate tilting and river shift in the southwestern Mississippi Embayment. Other indices of asymmetry are described by Keller and Pinter (1996, pp. 126, 127). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.7 Map of asymmetrical stream valleys in the vicinity of Taos, New Mexico showing method of measuring distances used in calculating index of asymmetry (modified after Muehlberger, 1979). \n\nLake patterns\n\nLakes are temporary features in terms of geological time, but they can be clear evidence of deformation. They occur at various scales, along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network, and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time. They may be isolated, but they are more frequently clustered in a specific area, or they are aligned along specific trends. Isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses, which form a dam, but clustered lakes are due to regional processes, which may be related to climate (or paleoclimate), neotectonic deformation, or frequently a combination of these processes. \n\nLarge lakes may occupy geological basins, and active tectonics is partly or totally involved in their formation. Such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations. The Bolivian Altiplano lakes (Titicaca, Popoo, Uyuni) stand at an elevation of around 4000 m and are associated with plate convergence and uplift. Continental stretching and transtensional tectonics are favorable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes. Often the relation of lakes to faults is obvious, and a study of the lake pattern is not necessary to demonstrate the effect of tectonics. (See Chapter 5 where Reelfoot Lake and the Mississippi valley sunklands are described; Figures 5.1, 5.2). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.8 Inferred fault zone in the area of the Tupinambaranas, in the Amazon Basin between Obidos and Manaus Brazil (modified after Sternberg, 1955). The river trace and ria lakes suggest a downward movement along the same axis as that of the inferred fault. \n\nThis discussion deals with cases where specific lake patterns, (ria lakes and elongated lakes), are related to active deformation. Most of these concepts are not new. For example, the significance of ria lakes was identified more than 30 years ago. \n\nRia Lakes \n\nDendritic ria lakes occur at the lower part of a tributary, which is blocked by aggradation along the trunk river (Holz et al., 1979). In the lower and central parts of the Amazonian Basin the formation of ria lakes is related to post-glacial eustacy (Irion, 1984). Some of these lakes have a \u201cknee\u201d pattern superposed on the dendritic pattern suggesting the effect of active faulting through a thick sedimentary cover (Sternberg, 1950, 1955, Figure 2.8). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.9 Structural scheme of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Basin in Peru, composed of the Pastaza Basin and the Ucamara Depression.

Clusters of ria lakes are observed along large rivers in the western Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Basin and in the central Ucayali Basin, Peru (R\u00e4s\u00e4nen et al., 1987; Dumont, 1993). They are related to active subsidence of the back side of piggy back or thrust faults. Similar patterns are observed on the south margin of the Beni Basin (Dumont, 1992; Dumont and Guyot, 1993). \n\nAn elongated cluster of ria lakes is located along the lower Pastaza River and the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River in the western part of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Basin (Figure 2.9). This cluster is superimposed over the structural axis of the basin, which trends toward the Ucamara Depression. This axis of maximum subsidence of the basin is located in front of the Subandean Thrust and Fault Belt (STFB). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.10 Relative positions of tectonic lakes in the Peruvian foreland basins.

No ria lakes are observed in the south part of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Basin (Ucamara Depression), but ria lakes occur again in the Ucayali Basin of Central Peru (Figure 2.10), a piggy-back basin. \n\nA continental rift generates tilt of the side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earth\u2019s surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers. For example, Lake Victoria is drained by the Victoria Nile which flows north to Lake Kyoga (Figure 2.11). Lake Kyoga and Lake Kwania look artificial, but they are not the result of dam construction. They are, in fact, formed by uplift and eastward tilting of western Uganda. Flow in the Kafu River has been reversed, and water draining from Lake Victoria has found a new course to the north, where it flows over Murchison Falls and into Lake Albert. The geologically recent derangement of these drainage systems is the result of uplift that is apparently continuing at the present time (Doornkamp and Temple, 1966). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.11 Lake Kyoga region, Uganda. Arrows show flow directions in rivers. Back tilting explains the shape of Lake Kyoga and Lake Kwania (modified after Doornkamp and Temple, 1966). \n\nElongated lakes \n\nThe term elongated lakes is applied to lakes that are long and narrow. These lakes are superimposed over basement structures. In subsiding basins, they are also closely related to active tectonics. \n\nThe Puinahua (1324 km2) and Punga (341 km2) lakes are both located in the south part of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Basin (Figure 2.10). They are long and narrow and wider on the foothill side than on the craton side. Punga Lake is superimposed over the structure of the Santa Elena uplift (Dumont and Garcia, 1991), which is interpreted as a crystalline horst surrounded by Paleozoic sedimentary strata (Laurent, 1985). The NE elongation of the lake is parallel to a few of the structural features mentioned by Laurent (1985). Both lakes are also parallel to the strike of normal faulting with a NNW\u2013SSE extension in the upland border (Dumont et al., 1988). As a result, the lakes are interpreted as the surface expression of tensional stress superimposed over reactivated basement structures due to the onset of Andean tectonics (Dumont and Garcia, 1991). \n\nMore precise morphological evidence of active tectonics comes from the Punga Lake. According to testimony of old settlers and published travel journals (Stiglish, 1904) the area was covered by forest, that developed on a terrace before 1923. Then the region began to subside. The tree trunks of the drowned forest are still visible, now below 2 m of water during low water stages. In this very flat area the water level rises about 2 m during floods, suggesting a minimum subsidence of 4 m over about 70 years. A tectonic interpretation is favored because a local rise of base level cannot be involved. Only a downward motion of the area where the lake is observed can explain the phenomenon. These lakes are related to downdropped blocks that are related to a tensional system. \n\nTerraces\n\nThe vertical warping of terraces, as a result of deformation, has been studied by numerous investigators (Machida, 1960; Zuchiewicz, 1980; King and Stein, 1983). The offset of terraces by lateral faulting gives a clear indication of fault movement. The offset terraces at the mouth of the Waiohine Gorge in New Zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic nature of the displacement (Figure 2.12). In addition to river terraces, the deformation of lake terraces and marine terraces (Keller and Pinter, 1996) are proof of isostatic and tectonic activity because they formed horizontally at a given water level. An example is the isostatic deformation of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville shorelines, Utah (Crittenden, 1963). Portions of the Lake Bonneville shorelines have been deformed as much as 210 feet, as it drained and evaporated to form Great Salt Lake. In addition, deformed marine terraces provide an excellent indication of recent deformation along 440 km of the Pacific Coast of Baja, California (Orme, 1980). Not only are terraces deformed, but as an uplift is crossed, a floodplain can be converted to a low terrace. This will, of course, dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of the reach. \n\nIn addition to the obvious evidence of deformation described above, evidence of deformation is provided by alluvial deposits and paleosoils (Machette, 1978; Keller et al., 1982; Bull, 1984; Rockwell et al., 1984; Rockwell, 1988) by variations in gradients of streams of different orders (Merritts and Vincent, 1989; Merritts and Hesterberg, 1994) and by variations of valley and river longitudinal profiles (Volkov et al., 1967; Seeber and Gornitz, 1983). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.12 Block diagram of the displaced river terraces at the mouth of the Waiohine Gorge, New Zealand. The West Wairarapa Fault extends from bottom left (southwest) to top right (northeast) and has cut and moved successive river terraces (I = oldest terrace; VI = youngest terrace). The amount (in feet) each terrace has been moved by the fault is indicated (H = amount of horizontal movement; V = amount of vertical movement). The length of the fault shown on the diagram is about 0.8 km (1/2 mile) (modified after Stevens, 1974). \n\nRiver response \n\nThe clearest evidence for tectonic effects on rivers are anomalous reaches that show dramatic changes of pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes. Structural geologists and petroleum geologists have known for years that rivers are strong indicators of faulting (Lattman, 1959; Howard, 1967). \n\nTectonic activity can significantly control river patterns and behavior, and this is especially true of alluvial rivers. Neef (1966) and Radulescu (1962) state that neotectonic movements can be reflected only in those geomorphic features that react to the smallest changes of slope, such as meander characteristics. In addition, the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in a given valley. Clearly, one of the most sensitive indicators of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of a stream (Bendefy et al., 1967; Zuchiewicz, 1979). \n\nAlluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change. In order to maintain a constant gradient, a river that is being steepened by a downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid, whereas a reduction of valley slope will lead to a reduction of sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change. For example, Twidale (1966) reported that both the Flinders and Leichardt Rivers have changed to a braided pattern, as a result of the steepening of their gradient by the Selwyn Upwarp in northern Queensland, Australia; and the Red River near Winnipeg, Canada is straightening, as a result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound (Welch, 1973). Other examples are provided by the Mississippi River between St. Louis and Cairo and the lower Missouri River (Adams, 1980) as well as the Red River of the North near Winnipeg, Canada (Vanicek and Nagy, 1980). \n\nBaselevel changes can also resemble the effects of active tectonics, and can provide information on channel change. For example, if sea-level is lowered, and a steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed, the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift. Lane (1955) argued that a lowering of baselevel will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river. Indeed, Lane\u2019s (1955) argument that a stream will restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baselevel change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade, then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel, the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished. However, sediment loads may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation. Another fallacy in Lane\u2019s argument is the assumption that the valley slope and channel gradient are identical. This is not the case, and the two-dimensional perspective leads to erroneous conclusions. For example, a sinuous river has a gradient less than that of the valley floor. \n\nSinuosity (P) is the ratio between channel length (L c) and valley length (L v), and it is also the ratio between valley slope (S v) and channel gradient (S c) as follows: \n\n\n\nTherefore, a straight channel has a sinuosity of 1.0, and the gradient of the channel and the slope of the valley floor are the same. It has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes (Schumm, 1968), and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the Mississippi, Indus, and Nile, reflect the variability of the valley slope (Schumm et al., 1994; Jorgensen et al., 1993; Schumm and Galay, 1994). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.13 Effect of a baselevel fall on channel length and pattern. See text for discussion. \n\nFigure 2.13 illustrates this concept geometrically, and it shows the impact of the lowering of baselevel in a valley with a stream of sinuosity (P) 1.5. The line A\u2013C represents the channel profile, and the line A\u2013B represents the profile of the valley floor. Points B and C are at the river mouth, and points F and G are at the same location in the valley. The channel distance is one-third longer than the valley distance, and the difference in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream. The length of the channel is 1.5 times the length of the valley and, therefore, the stream gradient is one-third less than the valley slope (equation 1). If a vertical fall of baselevel from B to D and C to E is assumed, channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor. If the channel is not confined laterally, it can adjust to the increased valley slope (F\u2013D) by increasing sinuosity to 2.0, and the channel profile is extended to H. In this case, incision ceases at point F in the valley and at point G in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from 1.5 to 2.0 from G to H maintains a constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope (F\u2013D). The one-third increase of channel length (sinuosity) between G and H compensates for a one-third steepening of the valley floor from F to D. \n\nAccording to Lane\u2019s assumptions, the effect of this baselevel fall would be propagated upstream to point A, where an amount of erosion equal to B\u2013D would occur. However, because the stream can adjust, the steepening of the valley floor will not result in a change of stream gradient. Rather the channel lengthens, and the effect of baselevel lowering is propagated only a relatively short distance upstream. The distance will undoubtedly depend on local conditions and the original slope of the valley floor, but this exercise supports Saucier\u2019s (1991) contention that Pleistocene sea level change in the lower Mississippi valley was effective only as far as Baton Rouge (see also Blum, 1993 and Blum and Valastro, 1994). The probability that a large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baselevel changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly, unlike during the experimental studies. The river, therefore, has more time to adjust by changing sinuosity. \n\nFurther evidence for the type of channel response shown in Figure 2.13 is demonstrated by the experimental studies of Jeff Ware (1992 oral comm.). He lowered baselevel relatively slowly to a maximum of 12 cm in a flume with a total length of 18.4 m. This change would have doubled the channel gradient. However, the effect of the baselevel lowering extended only 4 m upstream, and the change in baselevel was accommodated by an increase of sinuosity from 1.2 to 1.5 in the lower 4 m in the flume. It is clear, however, that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of baselevel. This channel widened and roughness increased, thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the baselevel change. \n\nWare\u2019s experiments showed that a sinuosity increase, which resulted in a slope decrease, was only part of the adjustment, and width, depth, and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power. Therefore, channel pattern change may only absorb part of a valley slope or baselevel change. The River Nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing as valley slope changes (Schumm and Galay, 1994). \n\nChanges of valley-floor gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern variations, but variations of valley-floor slope can be the result of several influences. Tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern (Adams, 1980). In addition, a high-sediment-transporting tributary may build a fan-like deposit in the valley, which will persist even after the tributary sediment load has decreased. When the main river crosses this fan, pattern changes will result, as the river attempts to maintain a constant gradient. Tributaries to the Jordan River in Israel have developed fan-like deposits in the valley, and the valley floor of the Jordan Valley undulates as a result. The Jordan River, as it approaches one of these convexities, straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops a more sinuous course on the steeper downstream side of the fan (Schumm, 1977, p. 140). \n\nIt is important to realize that channels that lie near a pattern threshold (Figure 2.3) may change their characteristics dramatically with only a slight change in the controlling variable. For example, some rivers that are meandering and that are near pattern thresholds become braided with only a small addition of bed load (Schumm, 1979). Experimental studies and field observations confirm that a change of valley-floor slope will cause a change of channel morphology. The change will differ, however, depending where the channel lies on a plot such as that of Figure 2.3 and depending on the type of channel (Figure 2.4). For example, with increasing slope, a straight channel will become sinuous, a low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous, and a meandering channel will braid. With decreasing slope, a braided channel will meander and a meandering channel will straighten. \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.14 Reaches of degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting. \n\nAlthough pattern changes may dominate river response, deposition in reaches of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in reaches of steepened gradient (Figure 2.14). In fact, upstream deposition will reduce downstream sediment loads thereby increasing the tendency for downstream erosion. Therefore, in addition to the primary valley-floor deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation, there are third-order effects beyond the area of deformation. For example, deposition upstream from the axis of a dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation (Figure 2.14). This means that the uplift is acting as a dam, and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift produces sufficient sediment to compensate, erosion will occur downstream beyond the limits of deformation. However, it is more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion on the steeper downstream reach, and when this increased load moves downstream, aggradation will result (Figure 2.14). \n\nNULL\n\nFigure 2.15 Effect of change from weaker (W) to more resistant (R) materials on meander pattern. \n\nAnother aspect of both active and neotectonics is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades. Resistant alluvium (clay plugs, gravel armor) or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shift and bank erosion. The result should be deformed or compressed meanders upstream and a change of meander character at the contact. For example, as meanders shift downvalley, their movement may be retarded if more resistant alluvium or bedrock is encountered (Jin and Schumm, 1987). Hence, a fault may present a barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed (Figure 2.15). A similar pattern will result if the river encounters bedrock as it crosses an upwarp or if, as a result of incision, it encounters resistant materials in a portion of its course. Yeromenko and Ivanov (1977) reviewed the Russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts, the largest number of meanders occur upstream of the structures, which supports Gardner\u2019s (1975) observations of bedrock channels in the Colorado Plateau. This is the reverse of what is expected for alluvial channels from the relation of Figure 2.3. Therefore, an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone. \n\nDiscussion\n\nAlluvium is usually assumed to hide the underlying geology, but rates of active tectonic movement are sufficiently rapid to affect the morphology and behavior of alluvial rivers. Rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even, slow, aseismic tectonic activity. For example, evidence of active tectonics is as follows: \n\n\n\t1.\n\tdeformation of valley floor longitudinal profile\n\t2.\n\tdeformation of channel longitudinal profile\n\t3.\n\tchange of channel pattern \n\t4.\n\tchange of channel width and depth\n\t5.\n\tconversion of floodplain to a low terrace\n\t6.\n\treaches of active channel incision or lateral shift \n\t7.\n\teffects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation (degradation, aggradation, flooding, bank erosion)\n\t8.\n\tformation of lakes \n\n\nAlluvial channels are sensitive indicators of change, but they also adjust to changes of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics. Therefore, it may be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when, in fact, human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time. Pattern change alone is not sufficient evidence for active tectonics, rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence and/or surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation. In many areas, the evidence will be circumstantial. Nevertheless, anomalous reaches that are not related to artificial controls, tributary influences, lithologic change, or paleotectonics may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise. \n\nLakes can also provide information on subsidence, and ria lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences. For example, during Pleistocene aggradation in the Ohio River and Mississippi River valleys, numerous lakes formed in tributary valleys. Therefore, care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies. \n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "CUP1", "class": "non-fiction"}

Whyte Jr\u2019s (1956) \u2018organization man\u2019 to walk permanently out of the front doors of the corporation, many of the assumptions of a traditional career path followed shortly behind. In the wake of his departure, people were left pondering how they would survive without a job for life, a corporate \u2018road map\u2019 to guide their destiny and the firm\u2019s hierarchy to define their status or place in society. Without employers\u2019 orderly structures, external guides for action, and linear career paths, however, just what is the future of career? When \u2018the career\u2019 devolves to the level of the individual does free agency prevail and a form of \u2018career anarchy\u2019 result? Is there anything that can be concluded about careers if everyone seems to be doing their own thing? \n\nWe argue here that the answer is an emphatic \u2018yes\u2019. The new environment suggests a shift from pre-ordained and linear development to perpetually changing career paths and possibilities. As a result a shift from \u2018bounded\u2019 careers \u2013 prescribed by relatively stable organisational and occupational structures \u2013 to \u2018boundaryless\u2019 careers \u2013 where uncertainty and flexibility are the order of the day \u2013 is increasingly common. The concept of the boundaryless career is broadly based, and intended to reflect the emergent pace of economic change. It does not characterise any single career form, but rather \u2018a range of possible forms that defy traditional employment assumptions\u2019 (Arthur & Rousseau, 1996, p. 6). \n\nThe myriad interactions of a boundaryless career over a lifetime of work experiences can appear overwhelming. A complex web of relationships emerges from numerous exchanges among individuals, teams, and employers. The interplay may seem downright chaotic. So much so, that one may be tempted to think that no aggregates can be drawn from this seemingly random micro-level behaviour. Yet, despite the large amount of publicity generated as \u2018organization man\u2019 was shown to the door, a large proportion of people who participate in the work place, and even whole industries, never really played by the traditional rules anyway. For these people and industries the \u2018boundaryless career\u2019 is simply business as usual. It is business to which we can turn to understand better the future of career or \u2013 as we see the future \u2013 the boundaryless career. \n\nWe focus in this chapter on situations where boundaryless career practices appear to be well established and fruitful, involving industries where open labour markets have thrived. Our examination suggests that seemingly random micro-level activities result in the creation of emergent pattern and order. Further examination reveals not only order, but remarkable stability. In the absence of external guides, people selforganise to learn and make sense of their environments. Moreover, the resulting social interdependence provides a new form of cohesiveness that, in turn, introduces new structure. Micro-level activities gather the force and the power to shape macro-level processes and larger institutions. It is organising, rather than organisation, that is the catch-word of the boundaryless career. \n\nIn this chapter we set out to explore the pervasive nature of boundaryless careers. We present a theoretical perspective through which we can understand the dynamics of boundaryless careers followed by descriptive analysis demonstrating evidence of theory in practice in two selected industries. First we present relevant aspects of Karl Weick\u2019s work (1979, 1995, and 1996) and discuss the process of \u2018enactment\u2019. We then examine the industry cases. We conclude by refining the arguments by noting key behavioural aspects of enactment and other considerations of the process. \n\nAn enactment perspective \n\nOur exploration in this chapter is framed in the social\u2013psychological perspective of Karl Weick (1996). Weick\u2019s work provides a theoretical lens for explaining the processes at work in boundaryless career behaviour. His conception of enactment, directly related to his previous (1995) work on sensemaking, explains the dynamics of the characteristic interdependence that operates in boundaryless careers. The enactment view emphasises that action creates the environment. That is, people create situations and understandings out of their own dispositions and backgrounds. A simple analogy is with the legal system. People enact laws, which become part of the legal system which in turn influences further behaviour, leading people to enact new laws, and so on. A legal system continually evolves from the enactment of individual laws. Similarly, career systems evolve from the enactment of individual careers. \n\nAnother way to engage with enactment is to relate it to the process of natural selection. According to Weick (1996), careers unfold through successive cycles of enactment, selection, and retention, whereby the enactment of careers gives rise to broader organising of work arrangements. From this standpoint, the \u2018basic theme for the entire organizing model is found in the following recipe for sensemaking: \u2018\u2018How can I know what I think until I see what I say?\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (Weick, 1979, p. 133). In the simplest form of the recipe, enactment is \u2018saying\u2019 (action), selection is \u2018seeing what I say\u2019 (perception), and retention is \u2018knowing what I think\u2019 (sensemaking). \n\nIf enactment is \u2018saying\u2019 then it is, in essence, the action of individuals in their environment that starts the process. When someone takes action, or interacts with their environment, it immediately impacts others and hence the individual produces part of their environment. For example, if you believe a certain group of individuals to be hostile, when you interact with them your behaviour may reflect your fear. In response they may sense that fear and behave in a hostile manner. The environment becomes hostile. Moreover, you have contributed to \u2018enacting\u2019 that hostile environment. The result is a circular self-reinforcing relationship resembling a self-fulfilling prophecy. An alternative, perhaps more satisfactory circular relationship could result if, instead of fear, you initially showed confidence. \n\nHow do we relate this process to boundaryless careers? For this, it is important to understand that there is less room for personal inputs, manoeuvring, or \u2018enactment\u2019 if there are clear salient rules and structures defining behaviour. In traditional bounded organisations and careers the proliferation of structure, hierarchy, plans, detailed job descriptions, prescribed relationships, and established \u2018road maps\u2019 provide an armoury of articulated rules and social cues to guide behaviour. The situation is \u2018strong\u2019 (Mischel, 1968) in as much as it provides little scope for improvisation. \n\nIn the pure form of the boundaryless career, however, such explicit guides do not exist. Instead of providing clear guidelines, employment situations are characterised by ambiguity. \u2018Weak\u2019 situations fall short of providing sufficient incentives for consistent behaviour or even similar expectations for those operating within them (Mischel, 1968). In \u2018weak\u2019 situations individuals are not able to interpret events in the same way, and the resulting ambiguity opens the door to myriad personal interpretations and opportunities for enactment. People engage in a stable process of trial and error that resembles an evolutionary system (Weick, 1979). People join together in shared improvisation that begins to form new codes and structures to guide their further behaviour. In the process \u2018microstrength shapes macroweaknesses\u2019 (Weick, 1996, p. 44) through the unfolding of boundaryless careers. \n\nTo illustrate the preceding argument we will apply Weick\u2019s ideas to descriptions provided by AnnaLee Saxenian (1996) on the dynamics of the Silicon Valley and by Candace Jones (1996) on the independent film industry. We reinterpret the contributions of these authors by explicitly re-framing them within Weick\u2019s framework (and we emphasise it is these three authors, and their original descriptions and ideas, that deserve the major part of the credit for this chapter). \n\nTo show how enactment and associated principles of self-organising and learning come to life, we will trace the process of enactment in each setting. First, we will describe the factors that have contributed to boundaryless career forms in each example. Next, we will cite some of the characteristics that make the resulting circumstances \u2018weak\u2019. After that we will discuss the social behaviour and collective actions that fill the resulting void in the environment. Finally, we will point out the patterns, order, and shape we see enactment bringing to each of these respective settings. By doing so we hope to convey the pervasive qualities of both the process of enactment and the vehicle through which it operates \u2013 the boundaryless career. \n\nThe Silicon Valley \n\nThe Silicon Valley is notorious for the individual and collective success of its firms. So much so that the name \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 has come to be synonymous with the electronics industry. The region is regarded as the centre for excellence and innovation and has given rise to some of the world\u2019s most influential firms, including Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Intel. Since its inception the Valley has operated with an individualistic open labour market. Today, the learning advantages that emanate from associated boundaryless career behaviour are regarded as a key source of competitive advantage for the region (Saxenian, 1996). One can argue that the Valley\u2019s \u2018boundarylessness\u2019 is a necessary feature of operating in a dynamic industry that demands constant innovation. Proponents point out that, in order to learn and solve the problems encountered in rapid technological advancement, knowledge must be shared among firms in a symbiotic balance between co-operation and competition. Boundaryless characteristics appear more prominently when an industry is knowledge \u2013 rather than capital-intensive or when firms operate in economic clusters. \n\nHowever, other industry clusters and several notable large electronics firms do not engage with boundaryless practices. We may, therefore, attribute the \u2018boundaryless\u2019 features of the Silicon Valley to its heritage. Some believe this is in part due to the location of the region, hosting a \u2018West Coast\u2019 Northern Californian alternative in geographical isolation from the established \u2018East Coast\u2019 industry. The greenfield site had an empty slate and no institutional rules. Others, like the late William Hewlett, a key and highly influential founder of the region, believe that success stemmed from the learning advantages of an open labour market. Hewlett \u2018routinely offered the following advice . . . \u2018\u2018If you want to succeed here you need to be willing to do three things: change jobs often, talk to your competitors and take risks \u2013 even if it means failing\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (Saxenian, 1996, p. 23). Hewlett was himself influenced by his Stanford Dean of Engineering William Terman, a mentor and an influential Hewlett Packard board member (Collins & Porras, 1995). Today, Hewlett\u2019s and Terman\u2019s philosophy permeates the region. Despite fierce inter-firm competition, open information exchange is common practice among the region\u2019s producers. \n\nSeveral features of the Valley contribute to creating a \u2018weak\u2019 environment. The high pace of technology and product life cycles, fluidity of firm formation and failure, rapid employee turnover resulting in little com-pany-specific socialisation, as well as a lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy, all contribute to an environment in which individuals rely on alternative cues to guide their behaviour. For example, in the Valley, technology moves quickly and competition is tough. New firms form almost overnight -and many disappear just as quickly. When firms come and go like ships in the night it is not surprising that employees tend to identify with their profession, not their company. Moreover, people\u2019s loyalty is not only to their profession, but to the host industry region. \u2018As one local semiconductor executive reportedly noted: \u2018\u2018Many of us wake up in the morning thinking that we work for Silicon Valley Inc.\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (Saxenian, 1996, p. 23). They view job-changing as the norm. \n\nAverage job tenure is in the area of two years, and annual turnover is around 35%, and often higher for smaller firms (Saxenian, 1996). As one engineer explained: \u2018two or three years is about the max [at a job] for the Valley because there\u2019s always something more interesting across the street\u2019 (Saxenian, p. 28). Knowledge and practices cross company borders at a pace that defies the embedding of \u2018routines\u2019 within the boundaries of any single company, and instead favours inter-company exchange. Everyone knows that, upon leaving a company, they may well work together again in the future: \u2018A colleague might become a customer or a competitor; today\u2019s boss could be tomorrow\u2019s subordinate\u2019 (Saxenian, p. 29). Institutionally based hierarchy, therefore, loses its saliency. In the Valley, respect and authority are gained through competence, technical excellence, and market share, with the highest regard accorded to successful entrepreneurs. \n\nIn the context of this \u2018weak\u2019 environment, clear social behaviour emerges as structure gets built at the micro-level. People seek to form relationships and routines in order to learn and thrive in their surroundings. In the Valley, information is the life-blood of the industry and continuous learning through relationships is the key to a successful career. People build their own competence by active membership in the larger learning community. Learning takes place in the pub or club. In the Valley\u2019s early days, it used to take place in the infamous Wagon Wheel Bar and the Homebrew Computer Club. Now it takes place in one of many watering holes or hobby groups where the Valley\u2019s high-technology workers regularly meet for lunch or after work. In these meeting places, people gather to see old friends, gossip, and make new acquaintances. In the workers\u2019 adopted social settings, the transition from friendly chatter to serious business occurs naturally. \n\nIn the Silicon Valley, collective actions unfold through a combination of mutual interests, intellectual curiosity, and problem solving geared towards developing new markets, technologies, products, or applications for computers. Workers have a systemic commitment to technical excellence in their field. As one engineer explained, the process is quite simple: \u2018people rub shoulders and share ideas\u2019 (Saxenian, p. 27). The knowledge of these informal groups is so powerful that many \u2018local entrepreneurs came to see social relationships and even gossip as crucial aspects of their business\u2019 (Saxenian, p. 26) As one local manager claimed: \u2018\u2018\u2018Over a lunch conversation or a beer, you\u2019ll learn that company A or company B has a technology you want . . . If it fits your needs, you\u2019ll build it into your next product\u2019\u2019\u2019 (Saxenian, p. 31). In this manner, micro-level conversations influence the creation of new technologies, products, and applications. \n\nIt is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how patterns and order emerge in the Valley. In the absence of hierarchy and centralised planning, employees in the Valley rely on their skills, rather than on formal position, to provide a reference point for their careers. Such self-generated guides are reinforced by professional social networks, which provide a tacit road map about who knows who and who does what in the industry. These networks serve as efficient job search networks and makeshift recruitment centres. As one engineer reported: \u2018\u2018\u2018You don\u2019t just hire people out of the blue. In general, it\u2019s people you know, or you know someone who knows them\u2019\u2019\u2019 (Saxenian, p. 27). Social networks impose structure on larger and looser situations. It is the region and its relationships, rather than the firm, that define opportunities for individual and collective advances in Silicon Valley (Saxenian, 1996). \n\nThus, while Silicon Valley\u2019s high rates of job mobility and new-firm formation lead to local losses for individual firms, they also foster a dynamic process of adaptation that spurs the evolution of the region. Knowledge of the latest techniques in design, production, and marketing is diffused rapidly throughout the area. The result is an exceptional rate of technical and organisational innovation created by a \u2018complex mix of social solidarity and individualistic competition\u2019 (Saxenian, 1996, p. 25). The resilience of Silicon Valley\u2019s economy shows that an unpredictable open labour market and seemingly \u2018chaotic\u2019 career paths and relationships have led to macro-economic stability for the region and hence continued opportunity for the community at large. \u2018Ironically, many of these Silicon Valley job hoppers may well have led more stable lives than the upwardly mobile \u2018\u2018organizational men\u2019\u2019 of the 1950s who were transferred from place to place by the same employer\u2019 (Saxenian, p. 28). \n\nThe independent film-making industry \n\nLike the Silicon Valley, the independent film-making industry is noted for its innovative ability, cutting edge creativity, and overall economic success. Like in the Silicon Valley, boundaryless careers are central to independent film-making activities. These activities evolved in the wake of fierce competition posed by the proliferation of television and the need to cut fixed costs. They superseded the former studio-based model of in-house film production, and its associated restrictive practices. Since the early 1970s, the new model has persisted. Boundaryless careers provide the building blocks that combine to facilitate production of the industry\u2019s separately creative parts. Independent film production has thrived as a superior organising model to its in-house predecessor (Jones, 1996). \n\nSeveral characteristics of the independent film industry favour boundarylessness, including the uncertainty in the marketplace, the limited project duration, the lack of vertical integration among industry players, and the excess supply of quality labour. The uncertainty of the market stems from the fact that production of any particular film revolves around whether or not sufficient financing is obtained to start and ultimately complete production of any given film. When financing is arranged, it is specifically for the purpose of completing a single project, the making of the film. The limited duration of the project is such that all resources, including human resources, are temporary. The assembled company is essentially wound down upon the film\u2019s release. At this time, the film\u2019s credits symbolise that those who made it have moved on to other assignments. \n\nUncertainty over financing and limited project duration foster a \u2018weak\u2019 environment in which permanent structure is dysfunctional. Studios combine with subcontractors for specific film projects and disband when the work is done. Moreover, the project-based system allows for highly complex, unique \u2018products\u2019 \u2013 films \u2013 to benefit from rapid and efficient allocation and re-allocation of resources. Each time a film is completed the whole process starts over again and employment relationships are re-negotiated. A ready supply of quality labour contributes to the success of the independent production model. The industry is a magnet for talented, committed workers eager for work on the industry\u2019s terms. These include being ready to depart to remote locations at a moment\u2019s notice. However, as with Silicon Valley high-technology projects, much of the work is economically \u2018clustered\u2019, thereby facilitating fluidity of movement from one challenge to another. \n\nAs Jones\u2019s (1996) research affirms, people\u2019s social behaviour reveals that several distinct stages can be observed over the course of a career in the film industry. At the \u2018beginning\u2019 stage, freelance employees are constantly vying to participate in an industry in which there are no clear rules for entry. As one grip/electrician explained: \u2018\u2018\u2018There\u2019s no tried and true way to get started. You have to find people you like who make movies . . . It\u2019s getting the first job that is the hardest\u2019\u2019\u2019 (Jones, 1996, p. 62). Once inside, the worker at the \u2018crafting\u2019 stage finds that, \u2018You build your reputation every day. You\u2019re only as good as your last job\u2019 (pp. 64\u20135). Reputation matters, as careers are self-managed and advanced through successive \u2018credits\u2019 that span multiple, largely forgotten, temporary film-making companies. \n\nHaving learned key skills and become indoctrinated into the industry culture, individuals enter a \u2018navigating\u2019 stage, furthering their reputation and developing the personal contacts that provide the resources to navigate from one project to another. In the words of one film commissioner, \u2018\u2018\u2018We are a big industry but a small industry because we talk to one another\u2019\u2019\u2019 (Jones, 1996, p. 65). It is through talking to each other that people gain access to experiences that both hone existing abilities and cultivate more complex skills. Eventually, successful careers go full circle and move to a \u2018maintenance\u2019 stage. Here, senior members of the industry identify and train new members, establish workshops that develop talent in the field, and co-ordinate events such as film festivals. During this period people address personal needs which may have been neglected during earlier career stages because of the necessity to survive in a relatively unforgiving industry. \n\nIn a \u2018weak\u2019 environment that lasts a lifetime, it is critical that non-bureaucratic forms of cohesion bring order to the industry. Part of this cohesion is provided by subcontractors, whose processes of selection, training, and socialisation bring boundaryless careers together in project-based arrangements that provide tacit infrastructure and social familiarity. However, it is at the level of the individual career that we can most clearly see the micro-level behaviour that fills the relatively structure-less context. Despite the fact that no explicit rules or operating procedures exist there is much tacit communication that binds professionals together. The aggregate effects of individuals acting independently leads to macro-level cohesion. Shared understanding and related expectations, for example regarding the need for unusual working hours and the use of \u2018idle\u2019 time to teach newcomers professional skills, play a key role linking identities to workplace interactions. In the process of learning the ropes, individuals are socialised and begin to make key contacts that help progress them to the next stages of their career. Once socialised, people engage in collective learning as they problem-solve on a project-by-project basis. Learning accumulates, disperses, and evolves as industry specialists enact their working environment. \n\nFrom micro-level enactment we see macro-level influence and patterns, order and shape in the independent film industry. Not only do we observe distinct stages of careers, we see aggregate social norms influencing behaviour. What one can see from the pattern of progression that characterises freelance boundaryless careers in the film industry is that although few formal boundaries exist, persistent social structures and repeated patterns of interaction can be observed. In the process of enacting their careers, individuals engage in reinforcing the cohesive social patterns of the industry which serve to guide the stages of their development. In this respect careers in the Silicon Valley and the film industry have much in common, with organising in film-making resembling a \u2018project-based\u2019 Valley. Just as careers can be traced in the Valley through the development of technology and tightly knit project teams, in film a clear pattern also emerges that reveals micro-level organising shaping macro activity. \n\nRefinements on enactment \n\nAgency and communion\n\nBoth of our previous examples suggest that the enactment of boundaryless careers unfolds through a mixture of personal initiative and mutual co-operation. Marshall (1989), after Bakan (1966), refers to the elements in this mixture as agency and communion. At a very basic level agency is about control and communion is about co-operation. Agency is individualistic, and characterised by autonomy, independence, initiative, and adaptation. It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people are ultimately responsible for their own development. Communion, in contrast to agency, is concerned about connections, relationships, tolerance, and trust. It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people need to manage their own arrangements for working with others.1 \n\nIn \u2018weak\u2019 environments, in which rules are not defined and behavioural responses not controlled, both agency and communion are means by which people respond to uncertainty. Agency provides direction and drive to career behaviour and helps to diffuse ambiguity by providing vision and long-term goals. Left to its own means, however, agency may cause strong hierarchies to reform, the balance of power to be lost, and, most importantly, the trust and co-operation necessary for people and information to move across boundaries to be forfeited. Communion provides the platform for mutual support and collective learning through which shared visions may be pursued. However, unbridled communion may neglect to attend to the mechanisms and rewards through which effective collaboration can occur. \n\nThe Silicon Valley and independent film-making examples illustrate the interplay of agency and communion. Agency occurs through the individual initiative and enthusiasm people bring to their careers within their adopted industries, communion occurs through the collaborative ways of working that substitute for more formal arrangements. Together, the combination of behaviours supports current high-technology or film-making projects while it simultaneously develops people for further opportunities. This development includes community-building that will influence the make-up and effectiveness of future project teams. Host industries will thrive, our examples suggest, as long as agency and communion are allowed to work in tandem (Rousseau & Arthur, 1999). \n\nContemporary views of work frequently lament a loss of community in restructured employment arrangements. However, in calling for a return to community, these views frequently look no further than the single company. An enactment perspective suggests that communities can be much more broadly diffused. Both the Silicon Valley and film-making stories demonstrate that host industries, as well as their embedded occupations, provide alternative contexts for community-building to occur. Other kinds of community \u2013 stemming, for example, from shared ideological, family, educational, ethnic, or gender attachments \u2013 can also provide enduring support for people\u2019s boundaryless career endeavours (Parker & Arthur, 2000). \n\n1\tSome researchers, notably Marshall (1989), emphasise the feminine characteristics of communion versus the masculine characteristics of agency. We do not do so here, although it may be interesting to contemplate whether the Silicon Valley is, in the broadest sense, \u2018feminised\u2019. \n\nReciprocity\n\nA related concept is that of reciprocity. Since workers cannot be all things to all people all of the time, a balance of behaviours is required. Reciprocity refers to the connection between what people give to and what people take from their employment situations. Traditional career models used to prescribe that people offer loyalty in return for deferred rewards. Accordingly, deferred pension rights, vacation time, promotion opportunities, and social acceptance were most reserved for those who had \u2018served their time\u2019. In contrast, those who changed employer were handicapped by the loss of the privileges that they left behind. The Silicon Valley and film-making worlds suggest a different logic: one where the old entitlement-based models are a hindrance to boundaryless career investments. \n\nWith boundaryless careers, employment relationships are too fluid to assume the trappings of traditional loyalty-based employment systems. In the simplest case, employment arrangements reflect a \u2018spot\u2019 contract involving a simple exchange of work for immediate financial payment. However, our examples suggest subtler forces are at work. People are recruited to participate in high-technology and film-making projects for the skills that they bring \u2013 skills that have been developed from previous projects. The system, at its best, consists of cycles in which the learning taken from previous projects is applied in the current project, which in turn provides new learning opportunities. The simple exchange of commitment to do one\u2019s best in return for learning opportunities may be a common one in contemporary employment, and one that inspires many workers to seek new employment pastures when their learning slows down (Arthur, Inkson & Pringle, 1999). \n\nThe concept of reciprocity reinforces the significance of project-based activities. Work which provides an underlying project-based structure, such as in construction (\u2018jobs\u2019), law (cases), or computing (programmes), provides a particular time span for reciprocities to occur. If the benefits are genuinely mutual, projects provide a basis for high commitment from both parties to the short-term employment contract. Yet, the benefits of reciprocity can accrue beyond the project\u2019s conclusion. Individuals can take their learning from projects and project participants with them. Meanwhile, their influence on other project participants can be retained in the sponsoring company, or the host industry, or both. Ultimately, other industries can also benefit as mobile workers transport best practices to new situations. \n\nA new continuity \n\nWhat general lessons can be claimed from our two examples? Many would argue that traditional employment systems, going back to the factories of the eighteenth century, do not favour boundaryless careers. We agree, but we also live in a time when those systems are failing, and where their underlying assumptions of stasis are incompatible with the emergent reality of persistent change. Moreover, those systems were designed according to a conception of \u2018labour capital\u2019 rather than to one of \u2018intellectual capital\u2019. Yet, it is the conception of intellectual capital that is increasingly emphasised today. Readers of this chapter will most likely see themselves as having a capacity for continuous learning. Is it really too great a step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the workforce at large? \n\nIf the workforce at large can learn, what are the social arrangements that best sustain new learning? Leaving the determination of what is to be learned to a few senior managers? Knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know, or at least contribute to knowing, what is best for themselves? Having people trapped by deferred rewards (Williamson, 1975), or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust? \n\nA colleague recently visited the Czech republic, and explored that country\u2019s relatively rapid adjustment to a market economy. She asked what was the single best thing a Czech worker could do to learn the underlying principles of the market. \u2018Work for McDonalds,\u2019 went the surprising reply, \u2018but only for six months.\u2019 It was explained that six months was quite long enough for the uninitiated worker to appreciate the importance of customers and customer service. After six months, the worker had learned what he or she could and it was time, from a career perspective, to move on. \n\nThe contrast between working for McDonalds for six months or working for McDonalds for a lifetime is, writ large, the contrast between boundaryless careers and their traditional bounded counterparts. Today\u2019s work is increasingly \u2018intelligent\u2019 work (Quinn, 1992), that calls on workers\u2019 learning capacities, and \u2013 as our examples suggest \u2013 provides an organising structure rich in project opportunities through which learning episodes can unfold. If that organising structure is lacking, the worker can heed the advice of our Czech informant and design a project for herself or himself. \n\nIn the future, we submit, most careers will be boundaryless. We have sought to illustrate the future by exploring two industries where boundaryless careers have flourished \u2013 reaping benefits for people, companies, and host industries alike. New theories, such as Karl Weick\u2019s theory on the enactment of careers, can help us to understand the underlying patterns and dynamics inherent in complex, self-organising, social phenomena. People may not need to move between firms perpetually, but they will need to take charge of their own learning agendas. As they take charge, boundaries will form and re-form, and underlying order provide a macro-economic stability in an environment in which \u2018organization man\u2019 has become all but extinct. \n\nacknowledgements \n\nWe are deeply indebted to Polly Parker of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, Anne Duncan and Svenja Tams of the London Business School, and Julian Smith for their feedback on an earlier draft of this chapter.

He had in mind Boston\u2019s newly built public library, a beautiful but in his opinion poorly functioning building. Billings, an ex-army physician, was responsible for organizing the Surgeon General\u2019s Library and a celebrated medical index. He was also an expert in hospital design, and was thus familiar with building construction. He drafted a plan for the new library whose most unorthodox feature was the location of the main reading room. It was not located near the main entrance, as was common practice, but on an upper floor, above the book stacks.\nThe terms of the architectural competition were strict and included detailed floor plans that the competitors were required to follow. There were two stages, intended to attract new talent as well as established firms. First, six architects were chosen from an open competition. These six then advanced to a second stage, where they competed against six invited firms that included not only McKim, Mead & White (the architects of the Boston Public Library), but also such luminaries as Peabody & Stearns, George B. Post, and an up-and-coming young firm, Carr\u00e8re & Hastings. The up-and-comers carried the day. McKim, much to his chagrin, not only lost but placed third behind Howard & Cauldwell. It was his own fault, since he imperiously ignored the suggested plan and substituted his own arrangement. Carr\u00e8re & Hastings conscientiously followed Billings\u2019 requirements.\nThe projected budget for the new library was not large ($1.7 million) and Billings expected a relatively modest building.* That was not what he got. All three designs were monumental. Carr\u00e8re & Hastings and Howard & Cauldwell used the Modern French style, which was more ornate and allowed for more articulation to the fa\u00e7ade than the austere Classical style that McKim opted for. All incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floors\u2014Corinthian in McKim\u2019s case, Ionic in the other two (the completed building is Corinthian). The compositional strategies were roughly similar: a monumental stair led to an elevated main floor; the entrance was placed in the center (more understated in McKim\u2019s elegant design); statuary and urns adorned the attic. All three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate, and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence, dignity, and of culture rooted in the past.\nI mentioned the New York Public Library competition when I gave a public lecture in connection with a recent architectural competition for the new Salt Lake City Public Library. The library board had conducted a national search for an architect, visited new libraries across the country, and solicited proposals from prominent architects. They had narrowed their list to four firms: Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel are respected New York architects with a long record of university buildings and museums, including a new library of science, industry, and business for the New York Public Library system. Moshe Safdie had built major civic buildings in Israel, Canada, and the United States, and recently completed the public library in Vancouver, British Columbia. Moore Ruble Yudell is a Los Angeles firm founded by the late Charles Moore, with whom John Ruble and Buzz Yudell built several university libraries and a public library in Berlin. Will Bruder, the least well-known of the four, is a southwesterner and the architect of the new, well-regarded Phoenix Public Library.\nI told my audience that I thought that the Salt Lake City library board would have a more difficult choice than their nineteenth-century New York counterparts. It was not a question of function. The Salt Lake City librarians had prepared an equally exhaustive program of requirements, so whichever architect was chosen commodity probably would be well served. As for firmness, I was reasonably sure that any of these experienced firms would build soundly. It was the consideration of delight that would make the selection harder. Gwathmey and Siegel design crisply detailed, understated buildings in a latter-day version of the International Style. Safdie, too, is a modernist, but he follows in the footsteps of Pei, and his buildings are frankly monumental\u2014the Vancouver library had been likened to the Roman Coliseum. Moore Ruble Yudell\u2019s work is different. Informal and animated, their eclectic Postmodern designs are likely to include ornament and architectural motifs drawn from their surroundings. Bruder, on the other hand, designs chic buildings that incorporate exposed structural elements, rough industrial materials, and sleek details. Building on the same site, fulfilling the same functional requirements, and using the same up-to-date construction technology, the four firms would produce libraries that would look different.\nThe library board awarded the commission to Moshe Safdie, and a year later the plans for the new building were unveiled. The new library will feature an unusual triangular-shaped main building and a curving wall-like structure that encloses a public square. A hundred years ago, it was taken for granted that the New York Public Library would be designed in some variant of the Classical style. Today a public library can take many guises. It can be relentlessly avant-garde, like the new $1.5 billion national library in Paris, where the books are housed in four L-shaped 22-story glass towers, and the readers are lodged in underground rooms, which the London Times described as \u201ca series of rectangular salons (identical of course) where you can admire the ultra-smooth gray concrete, steel grille ceilings and the expanses of African veneer.\u201d1 A new library can be comfortably Modernist, like the new British Library in London, which the Independent humorously described as \u201ca giant municipal building that has made its way from Scandinavia, having crashed headfirst through an English brickworks on the way.\u201d2 Tom Beeby\u2019s handsome Harold T. Washington Library in Chicago, on the other hand, is distinctly old-fashioned, with rusticated stone walls and carved brick ornaments that are a literal evocation of the city\u2019s nineteenth-century architectural tradition. Instead of trendy plastic or metal chairs, the reading areas are equipped with solid wood tables and traditional courthouse chairs. James Ingo Freed\u2019s Main Public Library in San Francisco, on the other hand, is both old and new: the imposing granite and stainless steel exterior is more or less Classical on one fa\u00e7ade, and more or less Modernist on another.\nThe coexistence of different architectural styles is nothing new. In a 1913 essay titled \u201cStyle in American Architecture,\u201d Ralph Adams Cram identified no less than seven contemporary styles, although he called them \u201ctendencies.\u201d Five were traditional: McKim\u2019s pure Classicism; the Beaux-Arts French Modern; Colonial, which was associated with houses but was also appearing in larger buildings such as the Johns Hopkins University campus; Cram\u2019s own High Gothic; and a looser interpretation of the medieval style as practiced by his partner Goodhue. Two were new: steel-frame construction, which Cram described as an enfant terrible; and what he called the Secessionists\u2014Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago, the Greene brothers in Pasadena\u2014who exhibited \u201ca strongly developed enmity to archaeological forms of any kind.\u201d Cram was not sanguine about the future, but he nevertheless concluded: \u201cChaos then confronts us, in that there is no single architectural following, but legion; and in that fact lies the honor of our art, for neither is society one, or ever at one with itself.\u201d3\nCram is right: most historical periods are marked by stylistic confusion; it is stylistic consensus that is unusual. There was such a brief consensus in the late 1890s, when both architects and the American public, under the influence of the immensely popular World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, embraced Classicism, at least for public buildings. That unanimity lasted long enough for the New York Public Library competition, but it began to unravel shortly after, as Cram\u2019s essay makes clear. There was also a consensus in the 1920s, at least among progressive architects. That consensus did not last either. After 1940, Mies van der Rohe gave up the free-flowing plans and asymmetrical massing that had characterized the Barcelona Pavilion and the Tugendhat House, and began designing buildings whose details and materials were Modern but whose layout and composition were distinctly Classical. In the 1920s, Le Corbusier proclaimed the \u201cFive Points of a New Architecture\u201d: the building raised on stilts; the roof garden; the frame structure that allowed a free plan; the free fa\u00e7ade; and the horizontal ribbon window. He, too, had second thoughts. Thirty years later, his wonderful chapel at Ronchamps had massive sculpted wall that concealed a concrete frame; the roof, far from being flat, resembled a billowing nun\u2019s coif. Le Corbusier, who had coined the famous expression, \u201ca house is a machine for living in,\u201d now adopted distinctly un-machinelike building materials such as crudely finished concrete, exposed brick, roughened stucco, and fieldstone. This volte face gave rise to the so-called Brutalist style, which had a worldwide influence, shaping the work of architects as dissimilar as James Stirling and Paul Rudolph, and ultimately opening the door to Postmodern stylistic experiments such as Charles Moore\u2019s little house in the Berkeley hills.\nThe inconstancy of the International Style practitioners should have been expected. The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules, only to bend and break them. Even Classicism, which appears at first glance to be highly regimented, is not immune. As far as we know, the ancient Greeks used only three orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Vitruvius describes them, and also refers to a Tuscan order, which is a Roman invention. Roman, too, is the so-called Composite order, an ornate blend of Ionic and Corinthian. The vault, the arch, and the dome, unknown to the Greeks, were other Roman additions to the Classic canon. Architects have been stretching Classical rules ever since: breaking pediments, flattening pilasters, magnifying and shrinking columns, rusticating masonry. A sixteenth-century French architect, Philibert de l\u2019Orme, invented a French order; Edwin Lutyens devised an order based on Mughal precedents for the Viceroy\u2019s House in New Delhi; more recently, Allan Greenberg created an order for the offices of the Secretary of State that incorporated the Great Seal of the United States. Michael Graves designed Classical caryatids (columns carved in the shape of human figures) to support the pedimented front of an office building for the Walt Disney Company in Burbank. While the supports of the porch of the Erechtheon in Athens take the form of graceful maidens, Graves\u2019 caryatids are the Seven Dwarfs.\nThe headquarters of a company whose logo is a pair of mouse ears obviously demands a different decorum from a temple. In the past, religious buildings and palaces required a narrow stylistic range. As architectural commissions grew to include civic and commercial buildings, warehouses, factories, shops and cinemas, houses and weekend houses\u2014every sort of building\u2014a single style no longer sufficed. Gothic is an evocative style for churches, but despite Walpole\u2019s efforts it is ill-adapted to houses. Romanesque makes imposing city halls, but is too heavy to be applied to skyscrapers. The International Style makes striking small buildings but monotonous large ones. Shingle Style cottages are pleasing; a Shingle Style Home Depot is ridiculous. As Cram wisely observed, \u201cArchitecture is nothing unless it is intimately expressive, and if utterly different things clamor for voicing, different also must be their architectural manifestation.\u201d4\nThe great architects\u2014Brunelleschi, Palladio, Wren, Richardson, Lutyens\u2014regularly looked to the past for inspiration. In 1965, Richard Meier built the Smith House, which has been called the first International Style revival building. Like all revivalists, Meier picks and chooses. At first glance, the Smith House has all the stylistic hallmarks of a Le Corbusier villa of the 1920s: a free plan, flat roof, white walls, pipe railings, horizontal ribbon windows, a ramp. Yet it is built out of wood and steel, not masonry. The white walls are painted wood siding, not stucco; the details are more refined, the plate-glass sheets are larger, the structure lighter. The result is an International Style that is filtered through American consciousness and shaped by American technology. It is like Thomas Jefferson building Classical columns out of wood\u2014the same, but different.\nAlthough art historians use terms like Gothic Revival and Greek Revival to distinguish later reincarnations of styles, architects look at history differently. \u201cFor the serious architect the past exists not as a legacy to be possessed through a self-conscious act of the \u2018modern\u2019 will,\u201d writes Roger Scruton in The Aesthetics of Architecture, \u201cbut as an enduring fact, an ineliminable part of an extended present.\u201d5 That is why architects, whether they are Inigo Jones or Louis Kahn, make architectural pilgrimages to the Mediterranean roots of Western architecture. Sketchbook in hand, they plumb the secrets of the master builders of the past. Consciousness of the past may also explain why architects tend to resist being categorized according to style; they instinctively understand that the history of architecture\u2014including the present\u2014is a continuity rather than a series of episodes.\nStylistic consistency is much admired today, but it was not always so. In 1419, Filippo Brunelleschi began the Foundling Hospital in Florence, whose delicate arcade of Corinthian columns surmounted by pedimented windows is generally considered the first building of the Renaissance. At the very same time, he was building a great dome over the crossing of the cathedral of Florence in a style that was not Classical but distinctly Gothic, pointed arches and all. The German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel is best known for his severe Classical public buildings such as the superb Altes Museum in Berlin, but he also worked in other styles: Gothic in churches, and picturesque Italianate in villas. McKim, Mead & White favored the Classical style for public buildings and palatial residences, but built Norman parish churches, Shingle Style summer retreats, French Renaissance mansions, and American Colonial country houses. John Russell Pope, an eclectic master, designed beautiful picturesque Tudor, Georgian, and Colonial country estates. Edwin Lutyens was another Classicist whose residential work was eclectic.\nDomestic architects had to be adaptable, because house styles changed according to fashion. In the United States, Tudor was popular in the 1900s, as was the Free Style; Cotswold and French Provincial appeared in the 1920s. After the 1930s, influenced by the restoration of Williamsburg, American Colonial returned to favor. The Cotswold style, with its relatively severe details and blunt forms, created a very different setting from French Provincial, which tended to have more delicate details, from Free Style with its almost rustic atmosphere, or from sturdy Colonial. Since historic styles carry cultural overtones, using different styles was also a way for architects\u2014and clients\u2014to say different things.\nIf architectural style is a language\u2014an analogy that is deeply flawed\u2014it is closer to slang than to grammatical prose. Architectural styles are mutable, unregulated, improvised. Architects break the rules, and invent new ones. In part, this is simply the irrepressible urge of creative individuals. In part, architects break stylistic rules because they can. After all, most of the rules that govern building design\u2014fire codes, building codes, zoning laws, budgets, programmatic requirements, engineering norms\u2014are outside the architect\u2019s control; stylistic rules are firmly within his purview. Since architecture is so intensely competitive, doing something unexpected, unusual, or just different is a way to be noticed, to rise above the crowd.\nIn addition to historical styles, there have also been styles associated with individual architects. The Palladian style made its way from Andrea Palladio to Inigo Jones, from him to Colen Campbell and Lord Burlington, and thence to Thomas Jefferson. It reappears in the work of contemporary Classicists such as Allan Greenberg. H. H. Richardson\u2019s influence was considerably shorter-lived, but for at least 20 years Richardsonian Romanesque rolled over the United States like an \u201caesthetic Juggernaut,\u201d in Cram\u2019s colorful phrase. Mies van der Rohe\u2019s steel-and-glass style likewise prevailed for more than two decades, and his characteristic I-beam window mullion can still be seen in contemporary curtain walls.\nBuildings like Jones\u2019 Palladian Queen\u2019s House in Greenwich, Adler & Sullivan\u2019s Richardsonian Romanesque Auditorium Building in Chicago, and Gordon Bunshaft\u2019s Miesian Lever House are not copies but satisfying originals. However, most personal styles are not easily adaptable. A building in Wright\u2019s unmistakable Prairie style, for example, simply looks like a knock-off. Some personal styles are simply too obsessive, which is probably why Frank Furness and the equally idiosyncratic Barcelona architect Antonio Gaud\u00ed never attracted a following.\nInigo Jones consciously based his work on the architecture of Palladio, but he did not think of himself as working in the Palladian \u201cstyle,\u201d any more than Palladio would have referred to the Classical \u201cstyle.\u201d Although Renaissance architects described their architecture as all\u2019antica\u2014in the antique manner\u2014they took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression: the Romans improved on the Greeks, and they would improved on the Romans. According to the architecture historian Peter Collins, the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late. He cites James Stuart and Nicholas Revett\u2019s Antiquities of Athens, published in 1762 and credited with inaugurating the Classical Revival in England. The authors, both architects, referred to \u201cthe Grecian and Roman style of building.\u201d6\nThe Latin root of \u201cstyle\u201d is stilus. A stilus was the sharp-pointed tool used to write on wax tablets and, by inference, stilus also referred to the way that something was written. This sense of technique carried over to English, and the original meaning of style was those features of literary composition that belonged to the form rather than to the substance of the matter being expressed. The seventeenth-century English musical composer Samuel Wesley put it neatly: \u201cStyle is the dress of thought.\u201d Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, who was Louis XV\u2019s architect and who founded the first full-time school of architecture in Europe in 1750, adopted this literary meaning as a metaphor and described architectural style as a building\u2019s character\u2014for example, rustic, regal, or heroic. \u201cStyle in the organization of fa\u00e7ades and in the decoration of rooms is the poetry of architecture,\u201d he taught his students, \u201cwhich alone makes all the architect\u2019s compositions truly interesting.\u201d7\nLiterary style described the way that something was written, expressed, or performed. Architectural style, in Blondel\u2019s sense, describes the way that something was built. Although architecture is often defined in terms of abstractions such as space, light, and volume, buildings are above all physical artifacts. The experience of architecture is palpable: the grain of wood, the veined surface of marble, the cold precision of steel, the textured pattern of brick. But exactly what do we see when we look at brickwork? We see the joints between the bricks and the mortar (which can be flush, or scraped out to create shadows; the bonding patterns; the way that the bricks turn the corner; the surrounding of openings; and the connection between the brick wall and the foundation or the eaves. What we see are details.\nDetails are a major preoccupation of the architect. Once the overall form of a building is determined\u2014\u201cthe masterly, correct, and magnificent play of masses brought together in light\u201d\u2014there remains the question not only of what materials are to be used and how these will be assembled, but also of how the hundreds of parts of the building are to be designed: from the door frames and the window sills to the railings and the baseboards.\nThe function of a baseboard is to cover the joint between the wall and the floor, and secondarily to protect the wall from scuffing. There are dozens of ways that this can be done. Baseboards can be prominent or discreet, a complicated assembly of board, cap and base, or a simple strip of hardwood. Or nothing\u2014many modern architects dispense with baseboards altogether. The baseboards in my living room are twelve inches tall. They are not wood but cast iron, since they are really disguised radiators. My house was built in 1908, influenced by the British Free Style of Voysey and Baillie Scott, and to further preserve a simple, rustic atmosphere the architect had the baseboards/radiators painted to resemble wood.\nRailings have a simple function\u2014they must be sturdy enough to support us if we lean on them, and they must provide a secure hand-hold: if railings are open, the spaces between the supports and the rails should be small enough to prevent children from falling through. Classical railings, developed during the Renaissance, consist of balusters supporting a handrail. Balusters\u2014little columns\u2014can have a single or a double swelling curve, or a vase shape. Fabricated in wood or masonry, they can be round or square in cross-section, and plain or highly ornamented. Railings can be replaced by parapets with pierced screens. These can be stone or metal: bronze, wrought, or cast iron. The screens can be simple X-shapes, intertwining geometrical patterns, or complicated floral figures as in Art Nouveau staircases. Perhaps the simplest open railings are those of the great Adirondack camps, whose builders mimicked X-shaped wrought-iron railings in unpeeled rustic tree trunks.\nModern railings are usually metal. In his early villas, Le Corbusier used white-painted pipe railings to create a nautical image; in later buildings like the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard, flat steel bars take the place of pipes. The railings in Mies van der Rohe\u2019s buildings usually have only a single intermediate rail, located precisely halfway between the handrail and the floor; the vertical stanchions, the handrail, and the rail are made of identical square steel bars. The railings in Louis Kahn buildings tend to be parapets, but where he is obliged to use an open railing the design is as simple as possible. I have seen a short stair railing that consisted of a single bronze bar, bent at each end to form the uprights. Richard Meier uses metal railings, too, but because there are sometimes as many as six horizontal rails, the visual effect is more pronounced\u2014they resemble staffs in sheet music.\nWhen Brutalism was in fashion, railings were correspondingly heavy: concrete beams, wide enough to sit on but unpleasant to the touch, or massive wood balustrades, as solid as fenders on a truck dock. The vogue among many younger architects today is toward lightness and exposed construction, and railings reflect that fashion, too. The screens of the railings of Peter Rose\u2019s Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal are industrial-looking perforated sheets of anodized aluminum, prominently bolted to the stanchions. Bernard Tschumi substitutes steel cables (complete with turnbuckles) for the intermediate horizontal rails of the ramp railings of Lerner Hall at Columbia University, another nautical reference, but to a yacht rather than a steamship. These solutions appear mannered compared to the simple railing that I. M. Pei designed for the East Building of the National Gallery. The stainless steel handrail highlights the solidity of the rose-colored Tennessee marble by appearing to float in mid-air, since it is supported by continuous sheets of tempered glass embedded in the floor.\nThe transparent railings of I. M. Pei\u2019s East Building are understated, elegant, and luxurious\u2014like the building. \u201cBeauty will result from the form and correspondence of the whole with respect to the several parts,\u201d taught Palladio, \u201cof the parts with regard to each other, and of these again to the whole.\u201d8 The successful relationship of the details to each other, and to the building is governed by the architect\u2019s sense of style. That is why the architect of my house painted the radiators to resemble wood; a technologically inclined architect might have painted them silver; a minimalist would dispense with baseboards and hide the radiators in the wall. The role of details is not to complement architecture; details are architecture. \u201cThe aesthetic understanding [of architecture],\u201d writes Roger Scruton, \u201cis inseparable from a sense of detail.\u201d9 Mies van der Rohe is supposed to have said \u201cGod is in the details.\u201d* He did not mean that details are functionally important (although they are), or that good details prolong the life of a building (although they do). He meant that details are the soul of architecture. That is why, just as an archaeologist can reconstruct a pot from a few shards, or a paleontologist can surmise the form of a prehistoric animal from bone fragments, it is possible to divine the architect\u2019s idea of a building by examining its details.\nThe house that Robert Venturi built for his mother in 1964 shook the foundations of the International Style; much of this effect was the result of details. Although Venturi obviously was working in a Modernist idiom\u2014there is a strip window and a steel-pipe railing\u2014he also incorporated distinctly un-Modernist features such as trim, both inside and out. Classical architects use a large variety of moldings\u2014fillet, astragal, egg and dart, ogee\u2014that can be combined and recombined to great decorative effect. The International Style, in its effort to do away with ornament, outlawed trim. Walls were flat planes. Windows had no frames. Joints between materials were simply hairline cracks. The conspicuous exterior dado, the baseboards, and the chair-rails in the Vanna Venturi House were hardly Classical moldings\u2014they were merely boards with chamfered edges\u2014yet they challenged the assumption that trim and Modernism were incompatible.\nComing through the front door of the Vanna Venturi House one immediately senses that it is an unusual place. A broad stair rises beside the fireplace, then peters out to almost nothing. The fireplace looks like an abstract sculpture, but it has a traditional mantelpiece. A free-standing column \u00e0 la Corbusier stands beside a chair-rail. Then there is the furniture. Ever since the Tugendhat House\u2014for which Mies had designed the furniture\u2014it was taken for granted that modern houses required modern furniture. Venturi has explained that \u201cI designed the house so my mother\u2019s old furniture (c. 1925, plus some antiques) would look good in it.\u201d10 Instead of the iconic bent-tube Breuer chairs, there are homely ladderback chairs around the dining table; instead of an Eames lounge chair and ottoman, a comfortable stuffed sofa. It is a contradictory atmosphere\u2014the International Style willfully distorted through the lens of traditional bourgeois domesticity.\nWhether one is looking up at the tall dome of the Pantheon, descending the spiraling vortex of Wright\u2019s Guggenheim Museum, or standing in the living room of Venturi\u2019s small house, the experience of architecture is above all the experience of being in a separate, distinct world. That is what distinguishes architecture from sculpture\u2014it is not an object but a place. The sense of being in a special place that is a three-dimensional expression of the architect\u2019s imagination is one of the distinctive pleasures of architecture. To create a strong sense of place, the surroundings must be all of a piece; space, mass, shapes, and materials must reflect the same sensibility. That is why details are so important. A jarring detail or an inconsistency\u2014something \u201cout of place\u201d\u2014and the fantasy begins to crumble. Yes, fantasy. Illusion has been a part of architecture ever since the ancient Greeks made columns with a gently swelling taper to deceive the eye. This is not to say that architecture is stage d\u00e9cor. When the wind blows, the canvas scenery blows over; the building resists the elements. Architecture surrounds and shelters us. It is the real world but it is also a vision.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nThe Postmodern movement that followed the Vanna Venturi House was relatively short-lived but it had an important consequence: it broke the stranglehold of Modernism, leaving designers free to explore other forms of expression. The profusion of styles that ensued is demonstrated by the work of three gifted but vastly different architects, Allan Greenberg, Hugh Newell Jacobsen, and Enrique Norten.\nAllan Greenberg is a confirmed Classicist. He does not consider this an anomaly. \u201cTo be truly modern,\u201d he writes, \u201cmeans finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present. Classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed.\u201d11 Although Greenberg looks to the past, his is not the attitude of an archeologist. Like Carr\u00e8re & Hastings, and generations of architects before them, Greenberg approaches Classicism as a tradition to be studied, absorbed\u2014then extended.\nEarly in his career, after emigrating to the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new fa\u00e7ade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work\u2014using Georgian and American Colonial styles. One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio\u2019s unfinished Villa Thiene. Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim, Mead & White.\nOne of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard. Completed in 1992, the low-lying building is shingled, but it is not exactly Shingle Style. Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts, giving them a fussy and nervous appearance. Such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away. Greenberg\u2019s aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub. The one-story Atlantic fa\u00e7ade is almost perfectly symmetrical: a large arched window flanked by two semi-circular bays, rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds. The two-story landward side is more informal, ringed by a sheltered porch. Massivity informs the details: sturdy Tuscan columns, a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof, rugged window frames. The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy: the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves. Inside, the fireplace has a brick hearth, a slate lintel, and a wood surround, whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece. The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough, reused timbers. Although most people would describe this house as \u201ctraditional,\u201d this is not an exercise in a particular historical style. There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect  C. F. A. Voysey, and it is obvious that Greenberg has looked at Lutyens\u2019 country houses. But this is a modern house, although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility. It admirably fulfills Palladio\u2019s call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the whole.\nHugh Newell Jacobsen studied at Yale under Louis Kahn, worked for Philip Johnson, and opened his own office in 1958. He established himself as a premier residential architect, winning commissions in the United States and abroad and receiving numerous design awards. Several of the awards were for restoration of historic buildings, notably the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the H\u00f4tel Talleyrand in Paris. A Modernist by training and inclination, Jacobsen was, nevertheless, affected by the winds of change unleashed by Venturi\u2019s little house. Starting in 1980, he evolved a hybrid style in which American regional forms and materials are combined with International Style precision, spareness, and simplicity. A house on Nantucket in shingles and white trim looks vernacular until one notices the careful proportions and refined, elegant details such as tall French doors in the living room that slide into wall pockets that also conceal shutters and screen doors. A post-and-beam Caribbean guest house with broad overhangs has the ingenuous simplicity of a beach shack. The Palladian plan and temple-like pavilions of an Ohio residence pay homage to the local Greek Revival. An Ohio country house recalls a board-and-batten Gothic Revival farmhouse. \u201cI endeavor to design buildings that express a sense of belonging,\u201d Jacobsen says, \u201cbuildings that reflect or abstract the nearby architecture and the traditions dictated by the climate and local materials.\u201d12\nThe Palmedo House, built in 1988, reinterprets the American Colonial architecture of its location\u2014Long Island. At first glance, the six pavilions resemble a little village, a little Amish village, judging from the austere white wood siding, the prim details, and the identical pitched roofs. Each pavilion is a perfect little \u201chouse\u201d with identical square and vertical multi-paned windows (that open by sliding into cunning wall pockets). This sounds precious, but Jacobsen is not a romantic. The central \u201chouse\u201d contains the living room, a three-story space open to the roof. Although the multi-paned windows are present at an upper level of the wall, the corner of the room is glazed with large, mullionless sheets of plate glass, offering dramatic views of Long Island Sound. This is an International Style device, as is the economy of detail and the clean, cool, atmosphere of the interior. On the other hand, the fireplace, which in an orthodox International Style house would be painted brick or bush-hammered concrete, is decorously built into the wall, which gives the room a traditional, civilized air. The chief idea here is to highlight the tension between old and new, between the traditional clapboarded architecture and the demands of modern life. Whereas Greenberg seamlessly resolves this tension, Jacobsen allows it to surface. If this sounds like textbook Postmodernism, it is not. Jacobsen artlessly combines new and old without the slightest hint of irony.\nJacobsen reacts to the collapse of Modernism by seeking a compromise position, while Greenberg anchors himself in the certainties of Classicism. Enrique Norten, the youngest of the three, takes a different course\u2014he is trying to put Modernism back together again. Norten, who studied at Cornell, established his office in his native Mexico City in 1985. In a relatively short time he produced an impressive body of work that includes institutional, commercial, and residential buildings. His major projects are a services building for the media giant TELEVISA and the National School of Theater. Both incorporate bulging, metal shell-roofs that recall the 1950s buildings of the French architect-engineer Jean Prouv\u00e9. Prouv\u00e9 was intent on applying new methods of construction, particularly industrialization and prefabrication. His buildings, extremely light and assembled from standardized elements, were real \u201cmachines for living.\u201d Norten, too, is preoccupied with industrial building technologies, the lighter the better. Double-tensed glass curtain walls are mysteriously supported by a steel-frame. Roofs hang by steel cables from steel masts. Slender, canted columns brace a glass-roofed portico. Railings, in a Norten design, are almost always opportunities for structural legerdemain: suspended sheets of glass, stretched steel cables, perforated metal screens.\nIn 1994, Norten built a house for himself and his family on a tight urban site in Mexico City. The three-story street fa\u00e7ade is mostly a blank concrete wall; the wall facing the interior walled patio is entirely glass. The main living floor is open, except for the kitchen; the upper bedroom floor is shaded and given privacy by a redwood, louvered screen. A functionalist style pervades the house. The clinical cabinetwork is white-painted wood. A concrete wall in the dining room is bare save for the regular pattern of the formwork ties and the pour lines marks. The windows are large sections of plate glass in simple aluminum frames; a 10-foot section slides aside to entirely open the dining room to the patio. The sliding wall recalls the disappearing windows in Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Tugendhat House, but the resemblance ends here. Mies\u2019 spare interior is opulent and assertive; Norten\u2019s is austere, almost monastic: a neutral background for family life. This is an unsentimental idea of the home. Not exactly a \u201cmachine for living,\u201d but certainly machinelike in its precision and rational layout.\nLike Greenberg and Jacobsen, Norten reflects on the past. Although his house has little to do formally with the International Style of the flat-roofed stucco villas of the 1920s\u2014except for the white-painted circular steel columns\u2014it shares that period\u2019s ambitions; it is highly abstract, idealistic, technophile, and lacking in applied ornament. Decoration results not from trim, but from the surface quality of the different materials\u2014concrete, red oak flooring, etched glass\u2014and from the relentless articulation of structural connections. Norten\u2019s buildings exhibit another feature of the International Style: they are placeless. That is, while they carefully respond to the specifics of the program and the site, they do not explicitly acknowledge their immediate regional context. Whether they are in Mexico or New Mexico\u2014where Norten is building a heritage center\u2014the style is the same: understated, coolly competent, cosmopolitan.\nWhether one prefers the work of Greenberg, Jacobsen, or Norten is a matter of taste (I happen to like all three). The buildings are different, yet the three architects have something in common. They are serious about what they are doing, that is, their buildings exhibit a strong sense of conviction. They pay enormous attention to details. They are disciplined, but they understand their self-imposed rules well enough to occasionally break them. Moreover, while their architecture is built with a great sense of style, it is never merely stylized. That is because in their buildings, style\u2014the manner of expression\u2014is always in the service of content\u2014that which is being expressed. Style without content quickly degenerates into caricature, like a speaker who makes grand gestures and rhetorical flourishes, but has nothing to say. The buildings of Greenberg, Jacobsen, and Norten, on the contrary, have a great deal to tell us about our past, our surroundings, and ourselves.\nGreenberg, Jacobsen, and Norten do not describe what they do in terms of style. I think that there are a number of reasons that architects are uncomfortable talking about the subject. A suspicion of style is a heritage of the Modern Movement, which preached against the arbitrary dictates of style and fashion, while maintaining an unspoken but rigid stylistic consistency. So deep-rooted is this teaching that it remains a moral stricture on most architects, whether or not they are Modernists. Perhaps another reason for the reluctance to discuss style is fear. Fear that being linked to a particular style is to be put in a box\u2014like most creative people, architects dislike being categorized. Also fear that talking about style will make architecture\u2014a serious business\u2014sound frivolous. Better to leave that to interior decorators and fashion designers, professions that architects regard with a mixture of disdain and envy. Finally, there is an unspoken fear of style because it is subject to the whims and the fancies of fashion. That fear, at least, seems to me to be ill-founded. An architecture that recognizes style\u2014and fashion\u2014would not be an architecture that is introspective and self-referential, as are so many contemporary buildings. It would be part of the world\u2014not architecture for architects, but architecture for the rest of us. And that would not be a bad thing.\n\nCoda\nRichard Morris Hunt was the most celebrated American architect of the late nineteenth century. His preeminence is reflected by his appointment as the architect of two important national works: the centerpiece building of the Chicago World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, and the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty. He was feted at home and abroad. Hunt was the first architect to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard and the first American to receive a Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects, and he was made an honorary member of the French Acad\u00e9mie and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. A hundred years later, his counterpart is Frank O. Gehry. Since being awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 1989, Gehry has gone on to win more honors than any other living architect, including such major arts awards as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize (a non-architectural award of which he is the first recipient) and the Japanese Praemium Imperiale, the Nobel of the art world. Even the staid American Institute of Architects, which had previously shunned Gehry in lieu of more mainstream practitioners, awarded him its top accolade, the AIA Gold Medal.\nNo pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple, the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica. Yet they bear comparison. They were both late bloomers. Gehry was 48 when he gained national recognition. Until then, he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years, building shopping centers, suburban offices, department stores, and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L.A. modern. The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house: a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick. That was in 1978. Unexpectedly, he attracted a broad range of commissions, not only residential clients, but also museums, public institutions, universities, corporations, and developers, and not only in the United States but around the world.\nHunt was 43 when he came into his own. He had established an architectural practice in New York in 1855, almost immediately on his return from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He was moderately successful, achieving local renown for the Tribune Building, an early New York skyscraper. Despite his Parisian background, Hunt worked in the prevalent Ruskinian Gothic style. Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan, the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote: \u201cThe building is of Gothic design with very red brick, and very irregular stone dressings, which, it must be confessed regretfully, are not pleasing to the eye.\u201d3 For his next project, the Lenox Library, Hunt tried something different. He borrowed from the French Neo-Grec style, popularized by Labrouste in the Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve, adding Renaissance details and his own characteristically vigorous surface modeling. The result was a startling departure from convention, a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity. The Lenox Library (which stood on Fifth Avenue on the site of the present-day Frick Collection) marked a shift in architectural taste, away from Ruskin to a grand and frankly aesthetic Classicism. The 1880s was a decade of great prosperity, and newly wealthy New Yorkers eagerly sought out Hunt\u2019s architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display. He obliged them in a string of high-profile commissions: magnificent mansions along Fifth Avenue, country houses on Long Island, and palatial \u201ccottages\u201d in Newport, Rhode Island. Hunt died in 1895, but in the last seven years of his life, he completed more than fifty projects.\nBiltmore House in Asheville, North Carolina, is a good example of his stylistic prowess. Hunt modeled the design of this 250-room residence on the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois, whose style is not the severe Classicism of the Italian Renaissance favored by architects such as Charles McKim, but the more ornate and picturesque French Renaissance. To a modern visitor, the spires, turrets, and steep slate roofs of Biltmore recall Disneyland\u2019s Sleeping Beauty Castle, which is not surprising since Disney also used a Loire Valley chateau\u2014the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Uss\u00e9\u2014as his model. But the comparison does Hunt an injustice, for his design is neither prettified nor quaint. His client, George W. Vanderbilt, was a young bachelor (he married soon after the house was finished), and for him Hunt created an architecture that is robust, masculine, and immensely self-assured, not in the least like a fairytale.\nVanderbilt was drawn to French chateaux, which Hunt showed him during a whirlwind European tour, since young George and his wealthy family imagined themselves American aristocrats. There are coats of arms bearing Vs all over the house. Hunt provides his client with an imagined regal setting, but deals with the past in his own peculiar way. Although he modeled the building on Blois, he makes no attempt to create a replica of the sixteenth-century chateau, but draws details from other buildings of the period and recombines them into an original whole. Nor does he try to create the illusion that this is a sixteenth-century building\u2014there is no artificial weathering, no aging effect no simulated historicism. The interior is modern, bright, and open. The focus of the main floor is a glass-roofed conservatory, a common nineteenth-century feature. The stonework of the house is impeccable, much crisper and more sharply defined than at Blois. Hunt was no antiquarian, and modern American technology abounds. The floors of fireproof hollow tile are supported by steel I-beams and the steep slate roofs by steel roof trusses. Cast iron replaces wrought iron and high-quality bricks, fired in the estate brickworks, back-up the limestone walls. Equally novel are the elevators and telephones, electrical lighting, hot and cold running water, and forced air central heating. There is no doubt that for Hunt, Biltmore is an up-to-the-minute modern building. That is part of its style, too.\nLike Hunt, Frank Gehry enlists novel materials in his buildings. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, for example, is clad in titanium, previously used chiefly for building aircraft. The metallic walls curve, twist, and turn. One part of the building slides under an adjoining bridge; another emerges from a reflecting pool. Bilbainos refer to the museum as the \u201cartichoke,\u201d which comes close to describing it, if you can imagine a gleaming, metallic artichoke more than two hundred feet high. The seeming disorder\u2014a chaotic collision of forms\u2014has no architectural precedent. This is not sculptural architecture, it is walk-in sculpture.\n\u201cThe plan is the generator\u201d preached Le Corbusier, but with Gehry, the plan is the result. He appears to design from the outside in. The building as a composition comes first, the interior spaces follow. This implies that he shoehorns functions into the building, which is not the case. The Guggenheim has three distinct types of gallery spaces: traditional, skylit rooms for displaying its permanent collection of early Modernist art; a long boat-like space for temporary installations; and 11 smaller galleries, each with its own character, each dedicated to the works of a selected living artist. The artichoke accommodates them all. The building may appear offhanded, but there is nothing haphazard about the way it is organized.\nGehry\u2019s talent is his exceptional formal imagination; his skill as an architect is to reconcile the forms he imagines with the functional demands of his client. And, of course, to find ways to build those forms. This is generally done without fuss. The titanium sheets simply follow the churning surfaces like shingles on a Shingle Style roof; limestone is used in a similarly unaffected fashion, without articulated joints. Gehry shares a minimalist approach to details with the early architects of the International Style, but he deploys these details to different ends. By removing familiar elements such as coping strips, fascias, and trim, he accentuates the sculptural quality of his buildings. There are no roofs or walls or windows in the Guggenheim, there are only swirling and twisting planes of metal, stone, and glass. An architecture critic once described Gehry as \u201ca smart man from Hollywood,\u201d which nicely captures the architect\u2019s blend of exuberant showmanship and canny behind-the-scenes savvy.\nAlthough sophisticated building techniques and innovative materials play a major role in Gehry\u2019s buildings, like Hunt, he keeps technology off center stage. In that regard, he repudiates the mannered industrial style that pervades the work of many contemporary architects. Neither is he nostalgic about the past. Gehry rejects both the moralistic functionalism of the International Style and the traditions of Classicism. Architects have broken rules in the past, but rarely this unequivocally and totally.\nGehry, like Hunt, has changed the course of architecture. That is, he has made us look at our surroundings in a different way. The world of Gehry\u2019s buildings is, at first glance, an odd place. The line between order and disorder is a thin one, and it is difficult to know what is intended and what is accidental. But his colliding forms and agitated architecture are curiously unthreatening. This is the way we live today, Gehry seems to be saying, why not enjoy it?\n\n\n\n\n", "mode": "written", "name": "rybczynski-ch3", "class": "non-fiction"}

All studies found\n        excess risk for persons with very low BMI, but that persons\n        with moderately high BMI had little or no extra risk except\n        in certain small subsets. A review of 13 studies of older\n        adults drew similar conclusions [ 7 ] .\n        Many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain\n        throughout adult life. It may be that a small amount of\n        gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the\n        most robust health as we age. It has been suggested that\n        weight standards be adjusted upwards for age [ 8 ] . Such\n        recommendations remain controversial, however, because the\n        number of studies of older persons is fairly small, and\n        because few studies have examined the relation of BMI to\n        quality of life or years of healthy life (YHL) in the\n        elderly [ 9 ] .\n        In older adults, risk factors may have a greater effect\n        on health than on mortality. If so, then behavior change\n        trials of weight modification might be more successful if\n        they were evaluated on improved health, rather than on\n        decreased mortality. Clinical trials powered to detect\n        differences in YHL would often require fewer subjects than\n        trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular\n        events [ 10 ] . In this paper we study whether BMI at\n        baseline is associated with living longer, and/or with more\n        years of being healthy, in a cohort of older adults for\n        whom risk factors, subclinical disease, and morbidity are\n        well characterized. The goal is to determine whether\n        analyses based on years of life (YOL) or on YHL would\n        provide substantively different results, and which measure\n        would yield more powerful evaluations of weight\n        modification interventions in older adults.\n      \n      \n        Materials and methods\n        \n          Study design: The Cardiovascular Health\n          Study\n          The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a\n          population-based longitudinal study of 5,888 adults aged\n          65 and older at baseline [ 11 ] . Subjects were recruited\n          from a random sample of the Medicare eligibility lists in\n          four US counties. Extensive baseline data were collected\n          for all subjects using a baseline home interview, an\n          annual mail questionnaire, and annual clinic\n          examinations. Additional information was collected in a\n          brief telephone interview 6 months after each scheduled\n          visit. Two cohorts were followed, one with 7 years of\n          follow-up (n = 5,201) and the second (all African\n          American, n = 687) with 4 years of follow-up to date.\n          Data collection began in 1989, and follow-up is virtually\n          complete for all surviving subjects [ 12 ] .\n        \n        \n          Body mass index\n          BMI was calculated as measured weight in kilograms\n          divided by the square of measured height in meters. A\n          report from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute\n          classifies normal weight (without reference to age) as a\n          BMI of 18.5 to 24.9; overweight as 25 to 29.9; and\n          obesity as 30.0 and higher [ 13 ] . We consider\n          separately the group with BMI between 18.5 and 20, which\n          was associated with lower survival in studies cited\n          above.\n        \n        \n          Years of life and years of healthy life\n          YOL is the number of years that a person lived in the\n          7 years after baseline. YHL is the number of years in\n          which the person was 'healthy', and is similar in concept\n          to quality-adjusted life-years, healthy year equivalents,\n          or active life expectancy [ 14 ] . We based YHL on\n          self-rated health (is your health excellent, very good,\n          good, fair, or poor?) (EVGFP) which was collected every 6\n          months. EVGFP is a simple but well-known measure, which\n          has been studied in detail [ 15 16 ] , and is predictive\n          of health events in many studies [ 17 ] . Because we are\n          examining health status over time, we added a sixth\n          health state, dead. Data were available about 93% of the\n          time. We used linear interpolation to estimate missing\n          data when there were known values before and after the\n          missing value, bringing the percent complete to 95% [ 18\n          ] .\n          For this analysis we defined YHL as the number of\n          years (of 7) in which a person reported excellent, very\n          good, or good health (were 'healthy'). YHL ranges from 0\n          (for persons who were never in excellent, very good, or\n          good health) to 7 years (for persons who were healthy\n          throughout). Since people reported their health every 6\n          months, YHL has a reasonably continuous distribution. A\n          drawback of this simple definition of 'healthy' is that\n          it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and\n          death, since all are considered 'not healthy'. We also\n          used an alternative approach, which assigns a different\n          value to each level of EVGFP [ 19 ] . Preliminary results\n          were similar for the two approaches, however, and we\n          report results using only the simpler definition.\n          The calculations had to be modified to include the 438\n          persons in the second African American cohort, who have\n          been followed only 4 years to date. For those persons,\n          and for 70 persons in the first cohort who did not have\n          complete data, we estimated the last 4 years of YOL and\n          YHL from their age, sex, and health at the end of 3\n          years, using validated methods presented elsewhere [ 20 ]\n          . That article showed that estimated 4-year YOL and YHL\n          were unbiased for the African American cohort. In the\n          primary analysis we used observed 7-year YOL and YHL when\n          they were available, and observed 3-year YOL and YHL plus\n          4-year estimated YOL and YHL when they were not (about\n          10% of the sample). We performed all analyses with and\n          without the persons who had partially estimated data, to\n          ensure that the estimation had not distorted the\n          findings.\n        \n        \n          Covariates\n          The goal is to examine the association of YOL and YHL\n          with BMI. To adjust for possible confounding we chose\n          baseline covariates that were prevalent in the elderly,\n          related to mortality and morbidity in previous studies,\n          and likely to be related to BMI. Self-reported covariates\n          include age, gender, smoking (never or former), history\n          of arthritis, cancer, diabetes, fair or poor self-rated\n          health status, limitations in activities of daily living\n          or in instrumental activities of daily living, and 10\n          pounds or more unintended weight loss in the year before\n          baseline. Clinical covariates include hypertension,\n          cardiovascular disease (prevalent heart disease,\n          peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease),\n          maximum thickness of the internal carotid artery,\n          depression (CESD score), serum albumin, serum\n          cholesterol, and serum creatinine. These measures are\n          explained in more detail elsewhere [ 21 22 23 24 ] . We\n          excluded 697 current smokers and 313 others with\n          incomplete covariate data, leaving 4,878 persons on whom\n          this analysis is based.\n        \n        \n          Analysis\n          All analyses were performed separately for men and\n          women. We calculated two sets of adjusted values, as\n          follows. We regressed YOL and YHL first on age, age\n          squared, race, and smoking history (former or never), and\n          second on all of the covariates listed above. We\n          calculated adjusted YOL as a person's observed YOL minus\n          predicted YOL (from the regression) plus the mean YOL\n          (6.52 years for women or 6.06 for men). That is, a\n          person's adjusted YOL is his residual from the regression\n          plus the grand mean. The mean of this new variable, for a\n          group of subjects, is the adjusted mean YOL for that\n          group. Adjusted YHL was calculated in a similar manner.\n          We calculated two sets of adjusted variables because of\n          the possibility of 'over-adjustment', controlling\n          inappropriately for factors (such as diabetes) which may\n          have been causally affected by the person's weight. We\n          plotted mean adjusted YOL and YHL against BMI, and tested\n          for difference among BMI groups using confidence\n          intervals or analysis of variance. Finally we calculated\n          the effect size for each measure, comparing each BMI\n          subgroup to the 'normal' group. The effect size is the\n          difference in mean YOL (or YHL) in two groups divided by\n          their common standard deviation. Since the sample size\n          required to detect an effect of this magnitude is\n          proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size,\n          large effect sizes are desirable.\n        \n      \n      \n        Results\n        Table 1shows the distribution of key variables by sex\n        and race. Mean age at baseline was 73.1 and about two\n        thirds of the men and a third of the women were former\n        smokers. Black women had a higher mean BMI and higher\n        percent obese (BMI \u2265 30) than the other three groups. Black\n        men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than\n        10 pounds in the past year; white women were least\n        likely.\n        About 78% of the subjects were healthy at baseline,\n        declining to 57% at the end of 7 years; 20% had died (data\n        not shown). Of the 22% who were unhealthy (fair or poor) at\n        baseline, about 24% were healthy 7 years later. There was\n        thus substantial change in EVGFP over time, in both\n        directions. Table 1shows the mean YOL and YHL (calculated\n        from EVGFP) in the first seven years of the study, adjusted\n        to age 73. For example, black women averaged 6.3 YOL, but\n        only 4.2 YHL of a maximum possible 7. We calculated some\n        additional descriptive statistics, shown in the final two\n        lines: years of unhealthy life (YOL minus YHL) and years\n        lost to death (7 minus YOL). White women had the most YHL\n        and black men the fewest; black women had the most years of\n        unhealthy life, and white men the fewest; black men lost\n        the most years to death (1.3 out of 7) while white women\n        lost only 0.4 years. For blacks, about 68% of their YOL\n        were healthy (YHL/YOL, not shown); for whites, about 75%\n        were healthy.\n        Among whites, the gender differences in Table 1were\n        statistically significant (p <.05) except for BMI and\n        unintended weight loss. Among blacks, gender differences\n        were significant except for 10 pounds unintended weight\n        loss and weight loss since age 50. Among males, there were\n        significant differences between black and white for BMI,\n        unintended weight loss, YOL, YHL, years of unhealthy life,\n        and years lost to death. Whites in the sample had higher\n        income and education (data not shown). After adjusting for\n        income and education, as well as age and former smoking,\n        the difference in BMI was no longer statistically\n        significant. Among females, blacks and whites differed\n        significantly on BMI, BMI>30, weight loss since age 50,\n        YOL, YHL, years of unhealthy life, and years lost to death.\n        After adjustment for income and education, the difference\n        in weight loss since age 50 was no longer significant.\n        Blacks had significantly lower YOL and YHL than whites\n        after adjustment for age, but the difference disappeared\n        after adjustment for the entire set of health-related\n        baseline covariates (analyses not shown).\n        We next examined the relationship of BMI to YOL and YHL.\n        Table 2presents the mean values of YOL and YHL, adjusted\n        for age, race, and previous smoking (columns 1 and 3), and\n        also adjusted for the entire set of covariates (columns 2\n        and 4). For example, YOL for women, adjusted for age, race,\n        and smoking, averaged 6.0 years for women with a baseline\n        BMI below 18.5, but averaged 6.6 years for women with a BMI\n        from 25 to 29.9. The second column, which shows results\n        adjusted for all covariates, is not very different (the\n        only discrepancy is for men with BMI < 18.5, a category\n        containing only 14 men). Adjustment for extensive\n        covariates also made little difference for YHL (columns 3\n        and 4). Subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age,\n        race, and former smoking. As mentioned above, the group\n        with BMI from 18.5 to 20 would be considered 'normal' by\n        the NHLBI guidelines, but had lower YOL and YHL than those\n        with 20-24.9 in all comparisons. For this reason, and to\n        increase sample size for those with low BMI, we combined\n        the two lower categories, defining underweight as a BMI\n        under 20.\n        Figure 1is a plot of adjusted YOL and YHL by sex and\n        BMI. For each BMI category the mean and its 95% confidence\n        interval are plotted. Categories whose confidence intervals\n        do not overlap, or overlap only slightly, are significantly\n        different. The bars are slightly offset to permit all error\n        bars to be seen.\n        YOL for women (the uppermost curve on Figure 1) averaged\n        about 6.5 out of 7 years, and showed no evident association\n        between BMI and YOL for BMI above 20. Underweight women\n        averaged about .25 fewer YOL than other women (p < .05\n        compared with normal group). Underweight men also had lower\n        YOL, but this group was not significantly different from\n        the normal group, in part because of low sample size. Men\n        classified as normal, overweight or obese all had about the\n        same YOL.\n        The lowermost two lines in Figure 1show mean YHL for\n        women and men. Women who were normal or overweight averaged\n        about 4.9 YHL. The YHL for underweight or obese women was\n        about 4.5 years, which was significantly lower than the\n        normal group. The relationship of BMI to YHL for men is\n        similar, but differences among BMI groups were not\n        statistically significant. YHL was significantly higher for\n        women than for men in the normal and overweight groups, but\n        the sexes had similar YHL in the underweight and obese\n        groups.\n        We next present the effect size for comparing each group\n        to the normal BMI group. The effect sizes are shown in\n        Table 3, with the significance results of the associated\n        t-tests for the differences in means of the two groups\n        being compared. For example, underweight women averaged\n        4.50 YHL compared to 4.92 for normal women, and the common\n        standard deviation was 1.44. The effect size is thus\n        (4.92-4.50)/1.44 = .29. The two groups had significantly\n        different YHL, implying that the effect size is also\n        significantly greater than zero. A clinical trial of a\n        treatment to help underweight women achieve normal weight\n        (presumably by addressing the underlying cause) could be\n        expected to have 80% power with N = (1.96+.84) 2/.29 2=\n        about 93 women per treatment arm, if 7-year YHL were the\n        outcome measure.\n        The biggest effect sizes are in the first row, comparing\n        underweight to normal. YHL and YOL have similar effect\n        sizes for women, and are significantly different from zero.\n        The effect sizes are not significantly different from zero\n        for men, in part because there were only 42 men in the\n        underweight category. The effect size comparing overweight\n        to normal yielded small, non-significant effect sizes, with\n        inconsistent signs, suggesting extremely large sample sizes\n        would be needed. For comparing obese to normal, only YHL\n        for women showed a large and significant effect size. Thus,\n        an intervention to improve the health of underweight women\n        to that of their normal weight peers could be performed\n        using either YHL or YOL as the outcome variable. Trials to\n        make obese women comparable to normal women could be\n        evaluated using YHL, but not YOL. Trials to improve the\n        health of the other groups to that of the normals would\n        probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being\n        overweight (for men or women) or obese (for men) affects\n        YOL or YHL.\n        As mentioned above, we repeated these analyses excluding\n        the persons with partially estimated data, and using two\n        different ways of coding YHL. The only substantive change\n        was that some of the differences between blacks and whites\n        shown in Table 1were no longer statistically significant,\n        due to a smaller sample size.\n      \n      \n        Discussion\n        \n          Optimal weight and overweight\n          Recent studies have defined obesity without reference\n          to age [ 6 13 30 ] . Andres \n          et al proposed a desirable BMI of\n          24-30 for persons aged 60 to 69 [ 8 ] . Allison \n          et al [ 31 ] proposed 27-30 for\n          older men and 30-35 for older women. In Figure 1, the\n          overweight (as opposed to the obese) are no different\n          from those of normal weight, suggesting that these two\n          categories could be combined for older adults. Since\n          future improvements in life expectancy may be limited [\n          32 ] , the greatest advances may be made by improving\n          people's YHL. This suggests that the development of\n          future guidelines should take YHL or other measures of\n          quality of life into account.\n        \n        \n          Implications for clinical trials\n          Based on these findings, trials to address obesity in\n          older women could be efficient if YHL (but not YOL) was\n          the outcome measure. That is, women who changed from\n          being obese to being normal would likely show changes in\n          YHL, but not YOL. Clinical trials of weight modification\n          interventions for older adults who were merely overweight\n          would appear to be fruitless since the interventions\n          would probably not have a direct effect on either YOL or\n          YHL.\n          Weight or weight change are sometimes used as the\n          outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or\n          exercise programs. The fact that weight is not associated\n          in a consistent way with health suggests that such\n          evaluations should be considered critically when older\n          adults are the subjects. This is particularly important\n          in the light of recent findings, which found that\n          interventions such as weight-loss drugs may be harmful [\n          33 34 ] . For older adults, the risks associated with\n          higher weight are especially unclear, and the optimal\n          outcome for a trial of weight loss in older adults\n          requires specific attention to improved health and\n          mortality.\n          Interestingly, the strongest health relationships were\n          found for underweight older adults. Clinical trials whose\n          objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their\n          normal-weight peers (presumably by addressing the\n          underlying conditions that caused the low weight) could\n          be performed efficiently using either YOL or YHL as the\n          outcome measure. Both YOL and YHL would be clinically\n          significant in this patient group.\n        \n        \n          Potential limitations\n          CHS participants were somewhat healthier than the\n          average older adult; however, adjustment for detailed\n          covariates made little difference in the findings. We\n          estimated the last four years of health data for about\n          10% of the sample, but results with and without this\n          group were similar. Analysis of mean YOL instead of the\n          more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was\n          appropriate here, since virtually no persons were lost to\n          follow-up. Biases caused by over-adjustment are probably\n          not large, since the findings were not sensitive to the\n          number of variables adjusted for.\n          These results are for a 7-year follow-up. The relative\n          superiority of YHL to YOL would probably hold in trials\n          with shorter follow-up. The effect sizes in Table 3might\n          also be appropriate in shorter trials, since lengthy\n          trials often add little information [ 10 ] .\n          EVGFP, on which YHL was based, might have missed some\n          effects of obesity on risk factors for future health. A\n          person who is depressed because of a poor self-image\n          related to obesity or who has osteo-arthritis related to\n          obesity and limits to activities to successfully avoid\n          pain would surely have worse EVGFP than others, based on\n          results from many studies. However, health measures\n          designed specifically to measure those conditions might\n          be more sensitive to change in weight than EVGFP. If YHL\n          were based on such measures, the superiority of YHL to\n          YOL would likely be even greater than that shown here.\n          These more sensitive measures might also have detected\n          differences between the overweight and normal weight\n          persons, but we think this is unlikely given the absence\n          of any differences in EVGFP.\n        \n      \n      \n        Conclusion\n        Recommendations for desirable weight have been\n        criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health. We\n        found associations between YHL and obesity that were not\n        present in the mortality analysis, suggesting that YHL may\n        be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in\n        older adults, especially for women. Future efforts to\n        determine desirable weight guidelines should include\n        measures of YHL. Using either YOL or YHL, however, we found\n        no excess risk for older adults who would be classified as\n        'overweight' by the NHLBI guidelines. This suggests using\n        YHL as the outcome measure in clinical trials involving\n        obese or underweight older adults, and discouraging trials\n        that address older adults who are merely overweight.\n      \n      \n        Competing interests\n        None declared\n      \n      \n        Abbreviations\n        BMI Body mass index\n        CESD Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression\n        Scale\n        CHS Cardiovascular Health Study\n        EVGFP Is your health excellent, very good, good, fair or\n        poor?\n        QALY Quality-adjusted life years\n        YHL Years of healthy life\n        YOL Years of life\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "1468-6708-3-1", "class": "technical"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/technical/1468-6708-3-3", "text": "\n  \n    \n      \n        The problem\n        Three published [ 1 2 3 ] and one recently presented [ 4\n        ] randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial have\n        unequivocally demonstrated that 3-Hydroxy-3-methylgluatryl\n        coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce\n        the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary\n        disease. These trials found that when compared with\n        placebo, statins significantly reduced the incidence of\n        death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous\n        and surgical coronary revascularization, and stroke in\n        persons with \n        stable coronary disease. Because\n        patients who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome\n        within three to six months of enrollment were excluded,\n        these trials did not assess the effect of lipid-lowering\n        therapy on adverse cardiovascular events in those with\n        recently \n        unstable coronary disease. Whether\n        lipid-lowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if\n        initiated immediately following an acute coronary syndrome\n        is an important issue as the risk of a recurrent adverse\n        cardiac events is much greater in patients with unstable\n        coronary disease than in the stable setting. The Myocardial\n        Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering\n        (MIRACL) trial set out to answer this question.\n      \n      \n        The answer?\n        MIRACL enrolled 3,086 patients within 24-96 hours (mean\n        63 hours) of admission for unstable angina or a non-Q-wave\n        myocardial infarction and randomized them to 16 weeks of\n        atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo once daily [ 5 ] . The major\n        exclusion criteria were: total cholesterol level greater\n        than 270 mg/dL; Q-wave myocardial infarction on admission\n        or during the previous month; and, coronary\n        revascularization in the months before admission, during\n        the index hospitalization or anticipated following hospital\n        discharge. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of\n        death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated sudden\n        cardiac death or emergent rehospitalization for worsening\n        symptomatic myocardial ischemia. Secondary endpoints\n        included stroke, worsening heart failure, need for coronary\n        revascularization and change in lipid levels throughout the\n        study. On average, patients were 65 years of age,\n        approximately 65% were men, 86% Caucasian and the mean\n        baseline low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level\n        was 124 mg/dL. Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a\n        2.6% absolute reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint\n        (14.8% vs. 17.4%; RR relative risk [RR] 0.84, 95%\n        confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.00, p = 0.048). This\n        reduction was primarily driven by the 2.2% absolute\n        reduction in incidence of emergent rehospitalization for\n        symptomatic myocardial ischemia (6.2% vs. 8.4%; RR 0.74,\n        95% CI 0.57-0.95, p = 0.02). The risk of death, nonfatal\n        myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden cardiac death\n        were each no different between the two groups. While there\n        were no significant differences in the incidence of\n        worsening heart failure or need for coronary\n        revascularization, atorvastatin did reduce the incidence of\n        fatal or non-fatal stroke by 0.8% (0.8% vs. 1.6%; RR 0.50,\n        95% CI 0.26-0.99, p = 0.045). Atorvastatin also\n        significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol and\n        triglyceride levels but did not significantly change high\n        density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 16 weeks. By 16\n        weeks, the adjusted mean LDL cholesterol decreased to 72\n        mg/dL in atorvastatin-treated patients but increased to 135\n        mg/dL among placebo-treated patients. No serious adverse\n        events occurred as the result of treatment with\n        atorvastatin, although reversible liver transaminase\n        elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal\n        occurred in 2.5% of atorvastatin-treated versus 0.6% of\n        placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001).\n      \n      \n        The MIRACuLous\n        The efficacy and safety findings from MIRACL were unique\n        for a number of reasons. Although lipid-lowering therapy\n        was associated with a significantly lower mortality when\n        initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome in two\n        large observational studies [ 6 7 ] , MIRACL was the first\n        randomized trial to suggest that statins confer clinical\n        benefits in this setting. It was also the first trial to\n        identify a short-term (ie, within 16 weeks) clinical\n        benefit from statin therapy; in previous secondary\n        prevention trials, the benefit of statin therapy was not\n        evident for one to two years. And, while clinical trial\n        safety endpoints may be considered less glamorous, MIRACL's\n        most important contribution may have been that high-dose\n        statin therapy was not associated with serious harm,\n        despite its use in the unstable setting. Earlier secondary\n        prevention statin trials had excluded patients with\n        unstable coronary syndromes largely out of theoretical\n        concern that statin-mediated reductions in vascular smooth\n        muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque.\n        That no harm resulted from this aggressive treatment\n        strategy should allay theoretical fears and by doing so\n        remove a major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of\n        lipid-lowing therapy after coronary events.\n      \n      \n        The not so MIRACuLous\n        Despite these unique and important findings, there were\n        a number of inherent study limitations worth noting. First\n        and foremost, the possibility of a null treatment effect\n        cannot be ignored given the wide confidence intervals (and\n        hence marginally significant p value of 0.048) for the\n        effect of atorvastatin on the primary efficacy endpoint.\n        Furthermore, while the number of patients lost to follow up\n        was small, if adverse events had occurred in those treated\n        with atorvastatin (n = 3) but not placebo (n = 8), the\n        overall trial results may have been neutral rather than\n        positive.\n        The types of events prevented in MIRACL are also worth\n        noting. While rehospitalization for recurrent myocardial\n        ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and\n        health care costs, other important endpoints were not\n        significantly affected (eg, death, myocardial infarction,\n        resuscitated sudden cardiac death, worsening heart failure,\n        need for coronary revascularization, etc). The question of\n        whether statins can prevent these and other adverse events\n        when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome will\n        require further study.\n        The short duration of follow-up is also particularly\n        troubling. While it is impressive that a clinical benefit\n        was realized after only 16 weeks of statin therapy, the\n        increased risk of adverse clinical events persists\n        throughout the year following an acute coronary syndrome.\n        Without longer clinical follow up, it is not possible to\n        assess the intermediate-term effect (if any) of\n        atorvastatin on hard endpoints such as death or myocardial\n        infarction. To do so would be critical in light of the lack\n        of effect on these important endpoints at 16 weeks.\n        Unfortunately, no late clinical follow up is planned.\n        There were also a number of limitations that may have\n        hampered the study's generalizability. First, patients who\n        underwent recent revascularization or in whom it was\n        planned were excluded. Specifically, patients who underwent\n        percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or\n        coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery within the\n        previous three or six months respectively were not eligible\n        for inclusion. The investigators reasoned that recurrent\n        ischemic events in this population were likely to result\n        from restenosis or bypass graft closure and that statins\n        would be less likely to affect these processes [ 8 ] .\n        Nevertheless, a number of trials have established the\n        benefits of statin therapy \n        early after coronary\n        revascularization [ 9 10 11 ] . Furthermore, a number of\n        recent trials have suggested that higher risk patients with\n        non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes fair better when\n        an early invasive strategy is applied [ 12 13 14 ] and it\n        is not uncommon for patients to be treated in this fashion.\n        Second, patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction were not\n        eligible for enrollment because it was felt that statins\n        would not influence the development of important prognostic\n        determinants such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction,\n        ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical complications [ 5 ] .\n        Nevertheless, patients who develop electrocardiographic\n        Q-waves represent a substantial proportion of all patients\n        with myocardial infarction. While their short-term risk\n        following hospital discharge is lower relative to those\n        with a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, it is still much\n        greater than in patients with stable coronary disease, and\n        the need for secondary prevention in this population is\n        equally important. Third, despite the high risk nature of\n        enrolled patients (ie, electrocardiogram [ECG] changes\n        and/or other objective evidence of ischemia), the rate of\n        platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor utilization was\n        quite low (1.1%). Such therapy appears to be cost effective\n        [ 15 16 ] , especially among high risk patients and is\n        recommended under current American College of\n        Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [ 17 ] .\n        Fourth, it may not be possible to ascertain whether these\n        findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary\n        syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels. The small\n        difference in number of primary endpoint events between\n        atorvastatin and placebo groups make it difficult to\n        dissect the relationship between baseline lipid levels and\n        treatment effect further. Consequently, it remains\n        uncertain whether one can extrapolate the MIRACL trial\n        results to those who undergo coronary revascularization\n        shortly before or after a coronary event, who present with\n        a Q-wave myocardial infarction, who are treated with\n        platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, or who have\n        relatively low admission LDL cholesterol levels.\n      \n      \n        Time to change current practice\n        Although MIRACL and the two aforementioned cohort\n        studies suggest that lipid-lowering agents exert short-term\n        clinical benefits when initiated soon after an acute\n        coronary syndrome, this remains an open question. Even if\n        these findings are not confirmed after further study, one\n        could still make a compelling argument that lipid-lowering\n        therapy (barring contraindications) should be initiated\n        early and universally in patients who present with an acute\n        coronary syndrome: First, the long-term safety and\n        effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of \n        stable coronary disease is\n        well-established [ 1 2 3 ] ; Second, as evidenced by\n        MIRACL, these agents are safe when initiated at the time of\n        hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome; Third, the\n        in-hospital initiation of lipid-lowering therapy appears to\n        promote greater long-term utilization of these agents [ 18\n        19 20 21 ] . Finally, although lipid levels may be\n        unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome\n        (excepting total :HDL and LDL:HDL cholesterol ratios [ 22 ]\n        ) the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary\n        disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and\n        non-pharmacologic lipid-lowering interventions to attain\n        recommended cholesterol targets [ 23 24 25 ] ; newer\n        guidelines are even more stringent [ 26 ] . Furthermore,\n        data from the recently presented Heart Protection Study\n        suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of\n        baseline cholesterol level [ 4 ] . Thus, to withhold\n        lipid-lowering therapy from patients who present with an\n        acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo,\n        and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the\n        secondary prevention setting have been dismal [ 27 28 ]\n        .\n      \n      \n        More MIRACLes ahead?\n        The ascertainment and quantification of any incremental\n        benefit conferred by statin therapy initiated early after\n        an acute coronary syndrome will require confirmation. There\n        is currently only one ongoing randomized placebo-controlled\n        trial of early versus delayed statin therapy in this\n        setting, A-2-Z (Aggrastat to Zocor, Merck) [ 29 ] . The\n        A-2-Z study is evaluating the efficacy of early treatment\n        with simvastatin in 4,500 patients following an episode of\n        unstable angina or a non-Q wave myocardial infarction. In\n        the first four months, patients will be randomized to\n        simvastatin 40 mg daily or placebo. Thereafter, those\n        patients treated with simvastatin in the first phase will\n        receive 80 mg of simvastatin daily and those treated with\n        placebo, 40 mg of simvastatin daily. The primary composite\n        endpoint is the occurrence of cardiovascular death,\n        non-fatal myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for\n        an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at one year. If A-2-Z\n        demonstrates significant reductions in the incidence of\n        adverse events during the first four months, it would\n        suggest an incremental clinical benefit from initiating\n        these agents early after an acute coronary syndrome. If\n        benefits accrue, but do so later during follow up, it would\n        be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more\n        aggressive vs. earlier lipid lowering therapy.\n        The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection\n        Therapy (PROVE IT) trial is looking at 4,000 patients\n        within 10 days of an acute coronary syndrome and\n        randomizing them to either pravastatin 40 mg or\n        atorvastatin 80 mg daily [ 29 ] . Patients will be observed\n        over at least 1.5 years for the occurrence of myocardial\n        infarction or other cardiovascular events. Unlike, MIRACL\n        and the A-2-Z trials, this study will not assess the\n        efficacy of early statin therapy after an acute coronary\n        syndrome; rather, it will examine the role of \n        more vs. \n        less aggressive lipid-lowering in\n        this setting.\n        In 2002, many would consider it unethical to withhold\n        statins from patients with established coronary disease.\n        This makes it unlikely that additional placebo-controlled\n        trials will be carried out in this area. Future secondary\n        prevention studies should look at patients with stable \n        or unstable disease and will need to\n        address the comparative efficacy of different statins (or\n        newer agents), assess the incremental benefit of\n        combination therapy [ 30 ] and determine whether there is a\n        serum cholesterol 'floor' below which reductions are\n        unlikely to provide further clinical benefit.\n      \n      \n        Competing interests\n        Dr Aronow has received honoraria as a speaker and\n        advisory board member for Pfizer and as a speaker for\n        Merck.\n      \n      \n        Abbreviations\n        HMG CoA = 3-Hydroxy-3-methylgluatryl coenzyme A; MIRACL\n        = Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol\n        Lowering; LDL = low density lipoprotein; RR = relative\n        risk; CI = confidence interval; HDL = high density\n        lipoprotein; PTCA = percutaneous transluminal coronary\n        angioplasty; CABG = coronary artery bypass graft; ECG =\n        electrocardiogram; A-2-Z = Aggrastat to Zocor; ACS = acute\n        coronary syndrome; PROVE IT = Pravastatin or Atorvastatin\n        Evaluation and Infection Therapy.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "1468-6708-3-3", "class": "technical"}

Three isoforms that differ in the ratio of\n        ATPase/ADPase activity are present on the cell surface [ 2\n        ] : E-NTPDase1 with a ratio of 1, E-NTPDase2 with a ratio\n        of 10 and E-NTPDase3 with a ratio of 3-5. NTPDases are\n        important in many physiological processes like cell\n        motility, adhesion, nonsynaptic information transfer,\n        secretion, regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases [ 1 ] .\n        Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the NTPDases will\n        help description of their physiological functions, and\n        development of strategies to regulate the functions of the\n        enzymes.\n        The catalytic mechanism of NTPDases is not known even\n        though some basic facts of the catalysis have been\n        established. NTPDases do not form phosphorylated\n        intermediates during catalysis, a conclusion also supported\n        by lack of vanadate sensitivity and Pi product inhibition [\n        3 4 5 6 ] . The catalytic reaction appears to be\n        irreversible and no partial reactions have been observed [\n        7 8 ] . Divalent cations like Ca 2+or Mg 2+are required for\n        activity, and maximal activity is reached when the\n        concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal\n        [ 1 ] . The specific activities of NTPDases vary over a\n        broad range from ten thousand units for potato apyrase to\n        less than one hundred units for chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase\n        [ 9 10 ] . Sequence comparisons indicate that most of\n        NTPDases contain five highly conserved regions, apyrase\n        conserved region, ACR1 - ACR5 [ 9 11 ] . However, the\n        catalytic sites have not been identified, although ACR1 and\n        ACR4 have been implicated in \u03b2- and \u03b3-phosphate binding,\n        respectively [ 9 ] .\n        E-NTPDase1 is also called CD39, as it was first\n        described as an antigen present on activated B and T\n        lymphocytes. Residues of ACR1 to ACR5 of CD39 have been\n        mutated to study the involvement of the ACR regions in\n        catalysis. E174 in ACR3 and S218 in ACR4 are required for\n        catalytic function [ 12 ] . Substitution of H59 in ACR1\n        converted CD39 into an ADPase in a quaternary structure\n        dependent manner [ 13 ] . Mutation of W187A in ACR3\n        affected CD39 folding and translocation, while mutation of\n        W459A in ACR5 increased ATPase activity but diminished\n        ADPase activity [ 14 ] . Mutations of D62 and G64 of ACR1\n        and D219 and G221 of ACR4 demonstrated that the nucleotide\n        phosphate binding domains of NTPDases are similar to those\n        present in the actin/heat shock protein/sugar kinase\n        superfamily [ 15 ] . These results suggest that the\n        conserved residues of the ACR1 to 5 regions are involved in\n        the catalytic mechanism of CD39.\n        The catalytic activity of CD39 is dependent on the\n        presence of divalent cations. Since the interactions of Ca\n        +2and Mg +2with proteins are difficult to study due to the\n        lack of spectroscopic properties, vanadyl (V IV=O) 2+has\n        been used as a probe of the ligands that compose Mg 2+, Ca\n        2+, and Mn 2+binding sites of several proteins, including\n        carboxypeptidase [ 16 ] , S-adenosylmethionine synthetase [\n        17 18 ] , pyruvate kinase [ 19 20 ] , and F \n        1 -ATPase [ 21 22 ] . This cation\n        specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites of\n        several enzymes, and in many cases serves as a functional\n        cofactor [ 23 ] . Vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial\n        coordination sites relative to the axis of the\n        double-bounded oxygen, an arrangement that is similar to\n        that for Ca 2+and Mg 2+. As it is known that the \n        A and \n        g tensors derived from the EPR spectrum\n        of bound VO 2+are a direct measure of the nature of the\n        equatorial metal ligands [ 24 ] , binding of VO 2+to CD39\n        could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of\n        CD39.\n        Recently we reported that a recombinant soluble CD39,\n        capable of hydrolyzing both ATP and ADP, was expressed and\n        purified from insect cells [ 25 ] . Only one\n        nucleotide-binding site was identified on the purified\n        soluble CD39 in the presence of Ca 2+when non-hydrolysable\n        nucleotide analogs were used. In this report, we\n        characterized the signals that were obtained from bound VO\n        2+when ATP or ADP was present at the catalytic site of the\n        purified soluble CD39. The possible metal ligands for VO\n        +2at the catalytic site are proposed and the catalytic\n        mechanism is discussed.\n      \n      \n        Results\n        \n          Nucleotidase activity of purified soluble CD39 with\n          VO 2+as cofactor\n          The ability of purified soluble CD39 to hydrolyze VO\n          2+ATP is shown in Figure 1. Soluble CD39 did not\n          hydrolyze either ATP or ADP in the absence of VO 2+(Fig.\n          1A). When VO 2+was mixed with ATP at a ratio of 1:1, the\n          concentrations of both ADP and AMP increased and ATP\n          decreased as the incubation time was prolonged (Fig. 1B).\n          The ATPase activity of sCD39 with VO 2+was about 25% of\n          that with Ca 2+as a cofactor. Vanadyl is unstable in\n          aqueous solution at pH7.0 in the absence of chelator and\n          will precipitate out of solution as [VO(OH) \n          2 ] \n          n . The rate of precipitation depends\n          on the abundance and affinity of the chelator. This means\n          that the actual VO 2+concentration was lower than 0.5 mM.\n          This result indicates that VO 2+can functionally\n          substitute for Ca 2+as cofactor for sCD39 nucleotidase\n          activity.\n        \n        \n          Characterization of bound VO 2+ADPNP by\n          CW-EPR\n          The parallel features of CW-EPR spectrum of bound VO\n          2+in the presence of ADPNP, an ATP analog, are shown in\n          Figure 2a. This spectrum shows 51V hyperfine splitting\n          and the center of the parallel transitions from molecules\n          with the V=O bond oriented along the magnetic field (A \n          || , g \n          || ) which are strong enough to tell\n          the nature of VO 2+equatorial ligands [ 22 ] . Of the\n          eight transitions that result from the parallel oriented\n          molecules, the -7/2 \n          || , -5/2 \n          || , +3/2 \n          || , +5/2 \n          || , and +7/2 \n          || transitions (shown in the figures\n          from left to right, respectively) do not overlap with\n          perpendicular transitions. The 51V hyperfine splitting\n          spectra from molecules with V=O bond perpendicular to the\n          magnetic field (A\u22a5) are much smaller and not shown here [\n          21 ] . The intensity of -5/2 \n          || peak is used as direct measurement\n          of the amount of bound VO 2+, since this peak is the most\n          intense peak in the EPR spectrum that contains\n          contribution only from A \n          || but not A\u22a5 [ 21 26 ] . In this\n          study, the intensities of each bound VO 2+-EPR feature\n          were normalized to 1 mg of protein.\n          VO 2+bound as the VO 2+-AMPPNP complex to sCD39\n          produced a strong spectrum characterized by A \n          || of 504.25 MHz and g \n          || of 1.9410 (Fig. 2b), called species\n          T (Table 1). The best fit of EPR species T to eq 1 is one\n          equatorial nitrogen from an amino group and three\n          equatorial oxygen ligands from carboxyl or phosphate\n          groups (Table 2). This result is consistent with AMPPNP\n          binding strongly to a single site on sCD39 in the\n          presence of metal [ 25 ] .\n        \n        \n          Characterization of EPR species from VO 2+-AMPCP\n          bound to sCD39\n          Figure 3ashows the parallel features of the EPR\n          spectrum of sCD39 bound VO 2+-AMPCP. Two sets of parallel\n          transitions were observed, and the derived A \n          || and g \n          || values are listed in Table 1. One\n          set had A \n          || of 521.78 MHz and g \n          || of 1.937, which is defined as\n          species D1 (Fig. 3b). The other set displayed A \n          || of 490.01 MHz and g \n          || of 1.9435, which is called species\n          D2 (Fig. 3c). The intensity of species D1 accounted for\n          11.4% of species T from bound VO 2+-AMPPNP, and the\n          intensity of D2 accounted for 7.1% of species T. The\n          intensity ratio of species D1 over D2 was 1.6.\n          In order to distinguish species D1 from D2, the sample\n          with VO 2+-AMPCP bound to sCD39 was thawed and incubated\n          at room temperature for 30 minutes, and the VO 2+EPR\n          spectrum was collected again. As shown in Figure 4aand\n          4b, either A \n          || or g \n          || values for both species D1 and D2\n          were changed. The intensity of species D1 was not changed\n          as it accounted for 12.1% of the intensity of species T\n          of the bound VO 2+-AMPPNP. However, the intensity of\n          species D2 was decreased dramatically, and it accounted\n          for only 0.1% of the intensity of species T. The\n          intensity ratio of D1 over D2 increased about 75 fold to\n          become 120.\n          There are two sets of equatorial ligands that can fit\n          well the EPR species D1 according to Eq 1 (Table 2). One\n          set includes two equatorial oxygen from two water\n          molecules, one equatorial oxygen from a carboxyl group or\n          phosphate, and one equatorial nitrogen from an amino\n          group. The other set contains one equatorial oxygen from\n          water and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups\n          or phosphate. The best fit for the EPR species D2 to eq 1\n          is one equatorial oxygen from a hydroxyl group and three\n          equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate.\n        \n        \n          EPR characteristics of sCD39 bound VO 2+-ATP\n          In order to capture the bound VO 2+-EPR signal before\n          the enzyme completely turned over, sCD39 and VO 2+-ATP\n          were mixed on ice, immediately transferred into the EPR\n          tube and frozen. The entire process took about 15\n          seconds. The parallel portion of the collected VO 2+-EPR\n          spectrum is shown in Figure 5a. VO 2+-ATP complex bound\n          to sCD39 produced an EPR spectrum with A \n          || of 489.5 MHz and g \n          || of 1.9455, which corresponded to\n          species D2 (Fig. 5b). The signal intensity from the bound\n          VO 2+-nucleotide complex accounted only for 7.5% of that\n          of species T from bound non-hydrolysable VO 2+-ADPNP\n          complex.\n          The same sample made from mixing VO 2+-ATP and sCD39\n          was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, then\n          the VO 2+-EPR spectrum was generated as shown in Figures\n          4cand 4d. The EPR parameters derived from this VO 2+-EPR\n          spectrum were 489.5 MHz for A \n          || and 1.9455 for g \n          || respectively, which is consistent\n          with species D2. However, the signal intensity decreased\n          about 37.5 fold compared to that obtained before room\n          temperature incubation.\n        \n        \n          Free VO 2+binding to sCD39 characterized by\n          CD-EPR\n          Like other metals (Ca 2+and Mg 2+), free VO\n          2+inhibited the nucleotidase activities of sCD39 at high\n          concentration (data not shown). VO 2+in the absence of\n          any nucleotides was added to sCD39 at 1:1 molar ratio.\n          The parallel transitions of bound VO 2+-EPR spectrum are\n          shown in Figure 6. The features derived from the VO\n          2+-EPR spectrum were 486 MHz for A \n          || and 1.946 for g \n          || , which was designed as species V\n          (Fig. 6b). The signal intensity of bound VO 2+accounted\n          for 20.3% of that from the bound VO 2+-ADPNP complex.\n          The best fit of equatorial ligands for species V\n          according to eq 1 is two equatorial oxygen from hydroxyl\n          groups and another two equatorial oxygen from two water\n          molecules.\n        \n      \n      \n        Discussion\n        Vanadyl has been used to estimate the types of groups\n        that serve as metal-ligands in F \n        1 -ATPase and other enzymes [ 16 18 19\n        21 ] because the g and A tensors of the 51V hyperfine\n        couplings are approximately a linear combination of tensors\n        from each type of group that contributes an equatorial\n        ligand [ 24 27 ] . By studying the EPR spectra of bound VO\n        2+in the presence of different nucleotides, we show that\n        the interaction of soluble CD39 with ATP is different from\n        that with ADP.\n        It is not surprising that VO 2+can functionally replace\n        Ca 2+in the hydrolysis of both ATP and ADP by soluble CD39,\n        although the enzymatic activity is about 25% of that with\n        Ca 2+as the cofactor, since F \n        1 -ATPase also hydrolyzes ATP at a\n        decreased rate when VO 2+replaces Mg 2+ [ 21 ] .\n        The EPR features of VO 2+are able to reveal some details\n        about how CD39 hydrolyzes ATP and ADP. A single EPR\n        feature, species T, was observed when ADPNP (a\n        non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP) complexed with VO 2+was\n        bound to sCD39, which is consistent with the presence of\n        only one nucleotide binding site [ 25 ] . The g and A\n        tensors derived from species T are 1.9410 and 504.25 MHz\n        respectively, which can be fitted best with one amino group\n        and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate\n        groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound VO 2+on\n        sCD39. In accordance with metal-ATP complex coordination on\n        other enzymes that hydrolyze ATP, like F \n        1 -ATPase [ 22 28 ] , the \u03b3- and\n        \u03b2-phosphate of ATP most likely bind to VO 2+while the third\n        carboxyl group is contributed by a side-chain of aspartate\n        or glutamate of sCD39. It is not unusual for the \u03b5-amino\n        group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes. It\n        has been reported that the amino group serves as one of VO\n        2+equatorial ligands in CF \n        1 -ATPase [ 21 ] , pyruvate kinase [ 19\n        20 ] , AdoMet synthetase [ 17 18 ] , and carboxypeptidase [\n        16 ] . Thus one amino group from lysine, one carboxyl group\n        from aspartate or glutamate, and two oxygens from the\n        phosphates of ADPNP serve as the equatorial ligands of\n        sCD39 bound VO 2+in the presence of ADPNP.\n        In the presence of AMPCP, bound VO 2+produced two EPR\n        features, species D1 and species D2 that are separated by\n        about 30 MHz. As we have reported that sCD39 releases\n        intermediate ADP before ADP is further cleaved during ATP\n        hydrolysis [ 25 ] , sCD39 probably has two conformations\n        that bind metal-ADP complexes, one is the conformation that\n        releases the ADP intermediate, and another that recruits\n        intermediate ADP back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis\n        to AMP. However, intact CD39 does not release intermediate\n        ADP during ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that there is only\n        one ADP binding site on each CD39 monomer in the intact\n        protein [ 2 25 ] . The two EPR species observed with VO\n        2+-AMPCP probably correspond to the two different\n        conformations of bound ADP at the same catalytic site on\n        sCD39. The signal intensity of the bound VO 2+-AMPCP EPR\n        spectrum indicates that species D1 is dominant over species\n        D2. In order to further assign species D1 and D2 to the two\n        different conformations, two experiments were done (Fig.\n        5). Incubation of sCD39 with VO 2+-AMPCP at room\n        temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the\n        intensity of species D2, while the signal intensity of\n        species D1 remained unchanged. These data indicate that VO\n        2+-AMPCP was released from the conformation corresponding\n        to species D2; however, the conformation corresponding to\n        species D1 still had bound VO 2+-AMPCP. More evidence for\n        two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the EPR\n        spectra of bound VO 2+-ATP. No species T was found\n        presumably because ATP was converted to ADP before the\n        sample was frozen. Only species D2 was observed and its\n        intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged.\n        We suggest that species D2 corresponds to the conformation\n        that releases ADP as an intermediate product and species D1\n        corresponds to the conformation that binds ADP as a\n        substrate. The lower signal intensities of species D1 and\n        D2 compared to that of species T suggest that the affinity\n        of sCD39 for ADP or its analog AMPCP is lower than that for\n        the ATP analog ADPNP, which is consistent with the result\n        that only ATP analogs were detected on sCD39 [ 25 ] .\n        The calculated g \n        || and A \n        || values that best matched the\n        experimental values for species D2 suggest that one\n        hydroxyl group and three oxygens derived from carboxyl\n        groups and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound\n        VO 2+-ADP. Since the conformation corresponding to species\n        D2 is found in the presence of ATP and is likely to be the\n        conformation that releases bound VO +2-ADP, it is likely\n        that the VO +2ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl\n        groups [ 25 ] . When ADP is the substrate and generates\n        species D1, one water molecule and a combination of three\n        groups between carboxyl groups and phosphates serve as the\n        equatorial ligands of bound VO 2+on sCD39. The probable\n        combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species\n        D1 is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since VO\n        2+complexes ADP through two phosphates before VO 2+-ADP is\n        bound to the enzyme.\n        The site directed mutagenesis studies on CD39 and other\n        members of the CD39 family give some hints about the\n        possible residues that serve as metal ligands at the\n        catalytic site of sCD39. The changes of D62 on ACR1, E174\n        on ACR3, D213 (D219 in HB6) and S218 on ACR4 dramatically\n        decrease both ATPase and ADPase activities of CD39 [ 12 15\n        ] . Figure 7summarizes the possible coordination of Ca\n        2+from the data of species T, species D1, and species D2 in\n        the different situations of sCD39 catalysis. The catalytic\n        base attack results in cleavage of the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP,\n        and one carboxyl group replaces the \u03b3-phosphate as a metal\n        ligand (from species T to species D2), which is accompanied\n        by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group (S218?).\n        This hydroxyl group (S218?) probably interacts with the\n        water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation\n        corresponding to species D1 to hydrolyze ADP. The constant\n        carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of sCD39\n        hydrolysis is likely contributed by D213 since it is close\n        to S218.\n        The results presented here also provide an explanation\n        to the free metal inhibition of CD39 catalytic activity.\n        Free VO 2+binds to sCD39 through two hydroxyl groups and\n        two water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other\n        residues of sCD39. Once free VO 2+occupies the catalytic\n        site, the enzyme has to either release the metal or correct\n        the conformation before the substrates are recruited\n        properly.\n      \n      \n        Conclusions\n        VO 2+can functionally substitute for Ca 2+as a cofactor\n        for sCD39. Four different EPR spectra are obtained for VO\n        2+bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the\n        absence of nucleotide. The protein ligands for VO +2in the\n        presence of ATP are suggested to be carboxyl and amino\n        groups, while those in the presence of ADP are probably\n        carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The mechanism of sCD\n        catalysis is discussed. These results will provide guides\n        for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of\n        NTPDases.\n      \n      \n        Materials and Methods\n        \n          Reagents\n          ATP, ADP, ADPNP, AMPCP were purchased from Sigma (St.\n          Louis, MO).

After concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B and\n          nickel affinity column chromatography, the ammonium\n          sulfate precipitated sCD39 was collected and resuspended\n          in about 50 \u03bcl of 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5).

In mammals, the two isoforms of this\n        enzyme, GAD67 and GAD65, are expressed from two separate\n        genes, \n        Gad1 and \n        Gad2 respectively [ 1, 2, 3]. GABA\n        signaling plays several roles in neuronal development.\n        Early in CNS development, GABA can modulate neuron\n        progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration,\n        survival and differentiation [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,\n        12, 13, 14]. In some classes of neural progenitors GABA\n        stimulates these processes while in others it has an\n        antagonistic activity. For example, recent work has\n        demonstrated that GABA acts in the developing neocortex to\n        stimulate the proliferation of progenitors in the\n        ventricular zone while inhibiting the proliferation of\n        progenitors in the subventricular zone [ 14]. Later, during\n        postnatal development, normal GABAergic input is required\n        for activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex as\n        shown in the \n        Gad2 knockout mouse [ 15, 16]. In\n        addition to these functions in the developing CNS, GABA\n        signaling is also required for the normal development of\n        non-neural tissues. Targeted mutations of the \n        Gad1 gene lead to defective\n        development of the secondary palate [ 17, 18]. The cleft\n        palate phenotype of the \n        Gad1 mutants suggests the involvement\n        of GABA-mediated signals in the normal development and\n        differentiation of a structure derived from the oral\n        epithelium and neural crest ecto-mesenchyme. This\n        conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate\n        defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in\n        the \u03b23 subunit of the GABA \n        A receptor [ 19, 20, 21, 22].\n        This intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for\n        GABA-mediated signaling in the development of a non-neural\n        structure, the secondary palate. The potential for this\n        pathway to be involved in the early development of\n        additional non-neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly\n        explored [ 23]. To address this question, we surveyed \n        Gad1 transcript distribution in the\n        non-CNS tissues of the embryo. Using a whole mount \n        in situ hybridization approach, we\n        found that \n        Gad1 is indeed expressed in a number\n        of different regions and tissues. A notable feature of this\n        expression pattern is that \n        Gad1 transcripts accumulate in the\n        specialized ectodermal structures that are involved in the\n        formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth.\n        These specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be\n        sources of developmental signals [ 24, 25, 26]. In\n        addition, transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem\n        cell population of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal\n        endoderm and mesenchyme. The expression patterns show that \n        Gad1 is expressed in several non-CNS\n        structures that are derived from each of the three germ\n        layers of the embryo.\n      \n      \n        Results\n        The mouse \n        Gad1 gene is widely expressed in the\n        embryonic central nervous system [ 27]. To define\n        additional sites of expression outside of the CNS, we\n        analyzed the distribution of \n        Gad1 transcripts in E8.5 to E14.5\n        mouse embryos by whole mount \n        in situ hybridization.\n        \n        Gad1 transcripts were not detected in\n        E8.5 day embryos (data not shown). At E9.0 \n        Gad1 was readily detected in the\n        tailbud (figure 1A). Expression in the tail continued\n        through E12.5 and was undetectable by E13.5 (figure\n        1B,C,Dand data not shown), a period corresponding to\n        secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo [ 28].\n        Examination of sections from an E9.5 embryo revealed a high\n        level of \n        Gad1 expression throughout the\n        mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of\n        the tailbud (figure 1F). No transcripts were detected in\n        the surface ectoderm surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme\n        (figure 1F). At more cranial levels within the tail,\n        expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm, ventral\n        neural tube, notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut\n        (figure 1E). In the paraxial mesoderm, the highest\n        expression levels were also localized ventrally, adjacent\n        to the notochord (figure 1E).\n        In the pharyngeal region of E9.5 embryos, \n        Gad1 RNA was detected in and around\n        the second, third and fourth pharyngeal pouches (figure\n        2A). Sections through the third pouch confirmed the\n        presence of \n        Gad1 expression in the pouch endoderm\n        (data not shown). Expression was particularly strong in the\n        dorsal portion of this pouch (figure 2B). The additional\n        diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal\n        mesenchyme (figure 2B). The expression in the pharyngeal\n        region was very transient; transcripts were easily detected\n        at E9.5, but only faintly at E9.0 and were not detectable\n        by E10.5.\n        In the limb buds, \n        Gad1 RNA was detected from E9.0 to\n        E11.5 (figure 3A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H). Transcripts were initially\n        expressed in the pre-apical ectodermal ridge (pre-AER) at\n        E9.5 (figure 3A,B) and by E10.5 were seen in the definitive\n        AER of the forelimb (figure 3D). At E10.5 \n        Gad1 was expressed in a diffuse\n        stripe in the forelimb (figure 3D) while in the hindlimb\n        expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm (figure\n        3E). By E11.5 forelimb AER expression was fading and\n        expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal\n        forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb\n        (figure 3G,H). The earlier activation of \n        Gad1 in the forelimb reflects the\n        normal temporal order of events in limb development.\n        Sections indicate that the expression within the limb buds\n        was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme (data not\n        shown). \n        Gad1 RNA was not detected in the\n        limbs by whole mount \n        in situ hybridization after\n        E11.5.\n        A dynamic pattern of \n        Gad1 expression was detected in the\n        developing vibrissae from E12.5 to E14.5 (figure\n        4A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H). Expression was first detected in the\n        supra-orbital, infra-orbital, and post-oral vibrissae and\n        in the posterior vibrissae in the lateral nasal and\n        maxillary rows (figure 4A,B; nomenclature as in [ 29]). \n        Gad1 RNA was also detected in some of\n        the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage. Expression\n        was activated in a posterior to anterior (towards the nose)\n        progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows,\n        reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development [ 29]. By\n        E13.5, \n        Gad1 expression was detected in the\n        anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows and was activated\n        in the rhinal, labial and submental vibrissae (figure\n        4C,D). By E14.5, expression was strong in the labial,\n        submental and rhinal vibrissae (figure 4E,F). Sections of\n        E12.5 whole mounts show that \n        Gad1 expression was localized to the\n        epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae (figure 4G,H)\n        and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate\n        (figure 4G).\n        Control hybridizations using a sense strand \n        Gad1 probe were also performed.\n        Embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any\n        staining pattern at any of the stages tested (E8.5- E14.5).\n        Sense strand hybridization results for E10.5 and E11.5\n        embryos are shown in figure 5.\n      \n      \n        Discussion\n        The expression results reported here show that \n        Gad1 was activated in several tissues\n        outside of the central nervous system during mouse\n        development. Transcripts were not seen at E8.5 and were\n        first detected at E9.0. It was surprising that this very\n        early phase of \n        Gad1 expression was largely outside\n        of the developing CNS and was localized in the tail bud\n        mesenchyme and in the pre-apical ectodermal ridge (pre-AER)\n        of the forelimb bud. As development proceeded \n        Gad1 was detected in pharyngeal\n        endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.\n        The data demonstrate that \n        Gad1 is expressed in several sites\n        outside of the developing CNS and in derivatives of all\n        three germ layers. We have also detected the expression of \n        Gad1-lacZ transgenes in the\n        developing vibrissae and limbs supporting the novel and\n        surprising \n        in situ hybridization results we\n        report here (J.J. Westmoreland and B.G.C., unpublished\n        results).\n        Previous studies have shown that \n        Gad1 can be regulated at the\n        post-transcriptional and translational level. \n        Gad1 mRNA translation or protein\n        stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level\n        of GABA [ 30, 31]. During embryogenesis,\n        post-transcriptional regulation occurs by alternative\n        splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice [\n        32, 33]. This alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop\n        codon into the \n        Gad1 mRNA and can produce the\n        truncated proteins, GAD25 and GAD44, from its 5'; and 3'\n        ends respectively. The studies reported here used a probe\n        that will detect the adult \n        Gad1 mRNA that encodes GAD67 as well\n        as the embryonic alternatively spliced mRNA that can encode\n        GAD25 and GAD44. These additional mechanisms of \n        Gad1 regulation may control the\n        production of GAD proteins and the synthesis of GABA in the\n        non-neural cell types detected in our study.\n        The whole mount \n        in situ hybridization data reported\n        here extends the results of a recently published section \n        in situ hybridization study on\n        E10.5-E12.5 mouse embryos [ 27]. Our analysis showed that \n        Gad1 expression is first detectable\n        earlier at E9.0 and revealed novel non-CNS sites of\n        expression in the pharyngeal region, vibrissae, tail bud\n        and limb bud. The results of the previous study [ 27],\n        together with the data reported herein, provide a\n        comprehensive picture of \n        Gad1 expression in the E9.0-E12.5\n        mouse embryo.\n        Previous studies have noted \n        Gad expression outside of the CNS. In\n        adults \n        Gad1 and \n        Gad2 have been detected in a number\n        of tissues including kidney, testis, oviduct, pancreatic\n        islets and adrenal cortex [ 34, 35, 36, 37]. Previously\n        reported sites of embryonic \n        Gad1 expression outside of the brain\n        and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens\n        fibers and the olfactory pit [ 38, 39]. In E10.5-E12.5\n        mouse embryos \n        Gad1 is expressed in the olfactory\n        and the lens placodes, the anlagen of the olfactory pit and\n        lens fibers [ 27]. We also detected \n        Gad1 expression in these tissues\n        (please see figure 3Aand data not shown). Expression of \n        Gad in the developing heart and blood\n        vessels has also been reported [ 27]. We detected weak\n        staining in the heart and did not detect blood vessel\n        expression, perhaps due to the very low levels of\n        expression in developing vasculature [ 27]. Our results\n        document localized expression of \n        Gad1 at additional non-CNS sites in\n        the mouse embryo, suggesting a potential role for GABA\n        signaling in the development of these structures.\n        Our interest in the role of GABA signaling in developing\n        tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from\n        the cleft palate phenotype of the \n        Gad1 and the \u03b23 GABA \n        A receptor subunit mutants [ 17, 18, 19,\n        21, 22]. The genetic data strongly suggest that GABA acts\n        through GABA \n        A receptors to modulate the development\n        of this tissue. Although the data reported here do not\n        explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype, they do\n        indicate that \n        Gad1 is expressed in several\n        additional non-CNS tissues in the mouse embryo. It is\n        particularly noteworthy that these include the AER of the\n        limb buds and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.\n        Both are ectodermal structures known to be sources of\n        developmental signals required for morphogenesis and\n        patterning [ 24, 25, 26, 40]. It will be of interest to\n        examine the expression pattern of GABA receptors in the\n        mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling centers.\n        Expression of GABA receptor subunits in adjacent tissues\n        would indicate that these receptors read the developmental\n        signals mediated by GABA in these structures and\n        tissues.\n      \n      \n        Conclusions\n        The mouse gene encoding the 67 kDa isoform of glutamate\n        decarboxylase ( \n        Gad1 ) is expressed in the tail bud\n        mesenchyme, vibrissal placodes, pharyngeal arches and\n        pouches and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), mesenchyme\n        and ectoderm of the limb buds in mouse embryos from\n        E9.0-E14.5. Some of the \n        Gad1 expressing tissues (vibrissal\n        placodes, AER) are known sources of developmental signals.\n        Other sites of expression correspond to stem cell\n        populations that give rise to multiple differentiated\n        tissues (tail bud mesenchyme, pharyngeal endoderm and\n        mesenchyme). The localized and dynamic expression pattern\n        of \n        Gad1 suggests a wider role for GAD\n        and GABA in the development of non-neural tissues than was\n        previously known.\n      \n      \n        Materials and Methods\n        Whole mount \n        in situ hybridizations were performed\n        on Swiss Webster embryos as described [ 41, 42]. The\n        morning that the vaginal plug was found was considered 0.5\n        days of gestation. The \n        Gad1 probe was derived from an EST\n        clone (accession W59173). Its 5' end corresponds to\n        nucleotide 142 in exon 1 [ 43] and the 3' end is at\n        nucleotide 2041 in the cDNA sequence [ 44]. Digoxygenin\n        sense and antisense RNA probes were generated by labeling\n        with digoxygenin-UTP during transcription. Embryos were\n        removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight and\n        used immediately for the \n        in situ hybridization. The embryos\n        were processed as described previously [ 41] and hybridized\n        to the probe overnight in 50% formamide, 5X SSC (pH 5.0),\n        50 \u03bcg/ml torula RNA, 50 \u03bcg/ml heparin at 70\u00b0C. The final\n        concentration of probe in the hybridization was 1 \u03bcg/ml.\n        After an overnight hybridization, the embryos were washed\n        at high stringency in prewarmed 50% formamide, 5X SSC, 1%\n        SDS (wash I) at 70\u00b0C for 90 minutes. The embryos were then\n        washed in a 1:1 mix of wash I and wash II (0.5 M NaCl, 10\n        mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 minutes at 70\u00b0C. The\n        embryos were washed several times in wash II at room\n        temperature to remove the formamide and then treated with\n        100 \u03bcg/ml RNase A, 100 units/ml RNase T1 in wash II for 1\n        hour at 37\u00b0C. Following the RNase treatment the embryos\n        were washed in three changes of 50% formamide, 2X SSC pH5.0\n        at 70\u00b0C for a total of 90 minutes. Detection of the\n        hybridized RNA probe was as described previously [ 41]. The\n        embryos were photographed without clearing using a Leica\n        model MZFL III dissecting scope, a Hamamatsu model C4742-95\n        digital camera and Openlab 2.0.7 software.\n        For sectioning, embryos were embedded in Immunobed\n        (Polysciences) resin and sectioned at 10 \u03bcm.

While 1\u00b0SS is\n        typically considered an autoimmune exocrinopathy, the\n        immune destruction can often extend to affect non-exocrine\n        organs. Around 25 % of patients with 1\u00b0SS can present with\n        involvement of other organs such as the thyroid, central\n        nervous system, lungs, kidney and liver. The association of\n        liver disease and 1\u00b0SS was suggested more than 40 years ago\n        [ 1 ] . While liver involvement in 1\u00b0SS has been considered\n        \"rare\" [ 2 ] only a few clinical studies specifically\n        address this complication and evaluate the association of\n        liver function tests abnormalities with the severity of\n        1\u00b0SS [ 3 4 5 6 ] .\n        Liver diseases associated with 1\u00b0SS include primary\n        biliary cirrhosis (PBC)-autoimmune cholangitis [ 8 9 10 ] ,\n        autoimmune hepatitis [ 5 6 ] , viral hepatitis (B and C) [\n        11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ] , sclerosing cholangitis\n        [ 22 ] , and nodular regenerative hyperplasia [ 23 ] . In\n        addition, chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis has been found\n        in patients with different types of liver cirrhosis [ 16 17\n        18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ] .\n        We report the results of a review of cases undertaken to\n        determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests\n        (LFTs) and liver disease in patients with 1\u00b0SS referred to\n        a tertiary care center and the association of abnormal LFTs\n        with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of\n        1\u00b0SS.\n      \n      \n        Methods\n        \n          Statistical analysis\n          The statistical analysis included descriptive measures\n          (means, standard deviations and ranges). Comparison of\n          results of patients with and without liver disease was\n          done using t-tests of continuous variables and Fisher's\n          exact test or x2 for categoric measures.\n        \n      \n      \n        Results\n        Of the 115 charts reviewed, 73 cases (55 women and 18\n        men, median age 53) fulfilled EECC for 1\u00b0SS and were\n        initially included for analysis. Of the 73 patients, a 54%\n        of them (40 patients) have had a salivary gland biopsy\n        performed. In all these patients, the biopsy confirmed the\n        diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. All patients studied had\n        objective evidence of 1\u00b0SS, including keratoconjunctivitis\n        sicca, positive labial salivary gland biopsy,\n        autoantibodies and/or salivary gland hypofunction. We\n        excluded those patients without these objective criteria of\n        1\u00b0SS and also those who did not fulfill EECC criteria.\n        The mean age at time of onset of disease was 45 \u00b1 20.5\n        years old and disease duration was 4.9 years \u00b1 4.5 years\n        (mean \u00b1 range). Liver function tests had been determined in\n        59 patients (80.8 %) and abnormal liver function tests were\n        found in 29 of the 59 patients (49.1 %). Further analysis\n        was then undertaken in those patients in whom LFTs had been\n        measured. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of\n        these patients are shown in Tables 2and 3.\n        For these SS patients studied, abnormal LFTs were more\n        common than any other potential non-exocrine features of\n        SS. Clinical evidence of liver disease, defined in methods\n        section, was found in 12 patients (20.3%), all of whom had\n        abnormal liver function tests. Two deaths occurred in the\n        population studied, both attributed to liver failure. An\n        additional patient required a liver transplant. In all\n        cases, the diagnosis of 1\u00b0SS antedated the onset of liver\n        disease or its diagnosis. Markers of viral hepatitis,\n        sought in 39 patients, were found only in 4. Two patients\n        carried the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus and one\n        had antibodies to hepatitis C virus. In a liver biopsy of a\n        patient who lacked serological markers for hepatitis\n        viruses, hepatitis B virus was detected by \n        in situ hybridization.\n        Risk factors for liver disease were identified in 40% of\n        the patients with abnormal liver function tests and are\n        described in Table 4. No association with tobacco use was\n        found. Only 5 patients had documented evidence of tobacco\n        consumption. We found no significant differences in risk\n        factors for abnormal liver function tests among patients\n        with or without hepatic involvement. Therefore, in 60% of\n        the patients with sub clinical or clinical evidence of\n        liver disease, no clear explanation for the abnormal LFTs\n        was found, except for the association with 1\u00b0SS.\n        The pattern of biochemical liver abnormalities was\n        mainly hepatocellular (defined as predominant increase of\n        AST and/or ALT in comparison with AP and/or bilirubins) in\n        11 cases; cholestatic (defined as predominant increase in\n        AP and/or bilirubins compared with AST and/or ALT) in 3 and\n        mixed (evidence of both cholestatic and hepatocellular\n        damage) in 8 cases. Abnormalities were persistent (present\n        on every occasion when measured more than once) in 19\n        patients (65.5% of those with abnormal LFTs), intermittent\n        (presence of LFT abnormalities was not found in all\n        determinations) in 9 (31%) and in one case (3.5%) there was\n        only one determination of liver function tests. The pattern\n        of liver enzyme abnormalities is shown in Figure 1. None of\n        the patients with abnormal liver function tests had\n        clinical evidence of muscle involvement that could explain\n        the high levels of amino-transferases. Activity of CPK or\n        aldolase was not elevated when measured in 15 of the 29\n        patients with abnormal liver function tests.\n        Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and anti-smooth muscle\n        antibodies (ASMA) were sought in 5 patients, with positive\n        ASMA in 2.\n        The association of abnormal liver function tests with\n        other non-exocrine features of 1\u00b0SS is shown in Figure 2.\n        Patients with abnormal liver function tests were more\n        likely to have lung, kidney or hematological\n        manifestations, when compared to Sj\u00f6gren's patients without\n        liver disease. Presence of other non-exocrine features of\n        1\u00b0SS was not influenced by prevalence of liver\n        diseases.\n        Regarding laboratory test results, patients with liver\n        disease were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation\n        rate at some point during the course of their disease. A\n        positive anti-ENA (anti-Ro, anti-Ro/La, and/or anti-RNP)\n        was also associated with an increased prevalence of\n        abnormal liver function tests (Figure 3). The sample was\n        too small to determine whether a specific ENA was\n        associated with liver disease. Other markers of systemic\n        inflammation or autoimmunity did not correlate with the\n        presence or absence of LFT abnormalities.\n        Liver biopsies, done in 8 patients, disclosed post-viral\n        chronic active hepatitis (3), cryptogenic cirrhosis (2),\n        and one case each of post-viral cirrhosis, alcoholic\n        hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis.\n      \n      \n        Discussion\n        In this group of Sj\u00f6gren's patients seen at a tertiary\n        care center, abnormal liver function tests were found to be\n        a common non-exocrine feature of 1\u00b0SS. The prevalence of\n        this association was found to be higher in our study than\n        in other previous series [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] . The true\n        prevalence could be even higher since liver enzyme profiles\n        were not done in all patients. The prevalence suggested in\n        previous reports ranges from 6 to 58 %, but the definition\n        of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific (e.g.\n        hepatomegaly) to well proven cases of liver disease [ 1 2 3\n        4 5 6 7 28 ] . Denko in 1960 reported that 12% of patients\n        with SS had hepatosplenomegaly [ 29 ] . Other studies done\n        in the 1960's also confirmed hepatomegaly in 18-20% of\n        patients with SS [ 30 31 ] . In 1970, Whaley reported liver\n        disease in 6% of patients with SS and mentioned an\n        association with anti-mitochondrial antibodies [ 2 ] . In\n        1986, Tsianos and co-workers described 22 SS patients with\n        gastrointestinal complications, called from a large cohort;\n        only two patients had liver disease, each with chronic\n        active hepatitis [ 4 ] . Other studies have reported\n        variable prevalence [ 3 28 ] and different\n        histopathological findings in liver biopsies ranging from\n        cholestatic liver damage (stage I primary biliary\n        cirrhosis) to chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis C\n        virus.\n        In our study, liver disease was associated with other\n        non-exocrine manifestations of 1\u00b0SS, specifically those\n        affecting lung, kidney and blood cells. Those patients with\n        serological evidence of systemic inflammation, as shown by\n        an elevated sedimentation rate, were more likely to have\n        liver test abnormalities. Also, the presence of a positive\n        anti-ENA correlated positively with hepatic disease. An\n        association of ENA response with liver disease has been\n        described in children with autoimmune hepatitis, where\n        anti-ENA-positive patients demonstrated more severe liver\n        test abnormalities than those who were anti-ENA-negative [\n        32 ] . In another study, a 15 % of patients with various\n        chronic liver diseases were found to be anti-RNP positive [\n        33 ] .\n        With etiopathogenesis of 1\u00b0SS still an open question [\n        34 ] , a possible role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has drawn\n        attention. Recent studies have mentioned HCV incidence in\n        patients with 1SS ranging from 14-19% [ 11 12 16 18 21 ] .\n        Phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands\n        with immunohistochemistry in patients with hepatitis C\n        virus infection and/or 1\u00b0SS has given conflicting results [\n        14 15 ] Some reports mention that the salivary gland\n        findings are strikingly similar in patients with liver\n        disease associated with HCV infection than in those with\n        1\u00b0SS [ 12 ] , while others mention distinctive differences\n        between both groups regarding focus score, expression of\n        surface markers in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary\n        glands and in epithelial cells, as well as differences in\n        the degree of inflammation [ 14 15 ] . Transgenic mice\n        models that carry the HCV envelope genes develop an\n        exocrinopathy affecting salivary and lachrymal glands [ 19\n        ] . Expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ\n        between HCV-infection and 1\u00b0SS. Positive ENAs are rarely\n        seen in HCV-patients. Also, in most cases sicca symptoms\n        are not present in individuals with HCV as compared with\n        the 1\u00b0SS population. Although the prevalence of viral\n        hepatitis markers in our group of patients with liver\n        disease was very low and did not account for most of the\n        cases with abnormal liver function tests, these markers\n        were not sought in a small percentage of these patients. It\n        is important to note that HCV appears to account for a\n        subgroup of patients with exocrine complaints in which half\n        the cases might meet the definition for SS according to\n        European and Manthorpe criteria. However, this subgroup is\n        characterized by the absence of clinical manifestations\n        observed in 1\u00b0SS, and the absence of anti-Ro and anti-La [\n        35 ] .\n        An aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and\n        different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a\n        mechanism for the damage seen in different organs in 1\u00b0 SS\n        [ 36 ] . Since it has been suggested that the target tissue\n        involved in the autoimmune histopathologic lesions of 1\u00b0SS\n        might be the epithelium [ 37 ] , it is interesting that the\n        findings in our study point to the association of liver\n        disease with pulmonary and renal abnormalities, all which\n        are characterized by epithelial damage [ 38 39 ] .\n        Epithelial cells have been proposed to be active\n        participants rather than passive targets in the chronic\n        immune response in 1\u00b0SS but further studies are needed to\n        establish the role of liver epithelial cells in the\n        pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease, including\n        the analysis of HLA expression and cytokine secretion\n        pattern in these cells.\n        The co-existence of liver disease and the presence of\n        circulating AMAs in Sj\u00f6gren's patients sera has been\n        pointed as an indicator that liver pathology might be\n        autoimmune and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis\n        [ 4 7 8 10 ] . In previous studies, a pericholangial\n        lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage I\n        of primary biliary cirrhosis, has been reported in 1\u00b0SS\n        with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for AMA [\n        4 7 ] . In our review of cases, we found predominance in\n        hepatocellular liver damage rather than cholestatic\n        disease, which would argue against a PBC-type of liver\n        damage. Other authors had proposed that SS associated with\n        PBC should be considered a form of secondary SS that\n        resembles more the \"sicca complex\" with exocrine features\n        seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ 40 41 ] .\n        Limitations of the study come primarily from being a\n        retrospective analysis. Since the patients were studied in\n        a tertiary care referral center, the severity of the\n        disease and the prevalence of the manifestations might be\n        different from the general 1\u00b0SS population. Furthermore, in\n        many cases, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome diagnosis had been sought\n        because of otherwise unexplained non-exocrine features.\n        While we could not find an association between use of\n        NSAIDS or other medications and prevalence of liver\n        function tests abnormalities, the study design did not\n        allow us to exclude the possibility of over-the-counter\n        (OTC) medication use that could have affected LFT's\n        measurement. Drug toxicity is certainly an important factor\n        to be considered. However, given that most patients had\n        persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of LFTs\n        and that the use of hepatotoxic drugs was not elicited in\n        the majority of patients with liver abnormalities, a toxic\n        effect of medications could not be established.\n      \n      \n        Conclusions\n        Based on the results of this study, we consider that an\n        evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver\n        disease should be done in every patient with 1\u00b0SS,\n        particularly if there is evidence of other non-exocrine\n        complications or serological evidence of systemic\n        inflammation. Although no other diagnosis explaining liver\n        disease may be found, the disorders for which treatment\n        might be beneficial (e.g. immunosuppressants for autoimmune\n        hepatitis, interferon-alpha for viral hepatitis,\n        ursodeoxycolic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis) warrant\n        a diligent search in all cases of 1\u00b0SS with abnormal liver\n        function.\n      \n      \n        Competing interests\n        None.\n      \n      \n        Authors' contributions\n        Both authors contributed equally to the paper.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "1471-230X-2-21", "class": "technical"}

Mr. Annan stressed the\n        importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing\n        countries, asserting that \u201cThis unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates\n        serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries, but for\n        development itself.\u201d Indeed, Mr. Annan's sentiments have also been echoed recently by\n        several scientists, who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific\n        output between the developing and already developed countries (Gibbs 1995; May 1997;\n        Goldemberg 1998; Riddoch 2000). For example, recent United Nations Educational, Scientific,\n        and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates (UNESCO 2001) indicate that, in 1997, the\n        developed countries accounted for some 84% of the global investment in scientific research\n        and development, had approximately 72% of the world researchers, and produced approximately\n        88% of all scientific and technical publications registered by the Science Citation Index\n        (SCI). North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications\n        produced annually, with 36.6% and 37.5%, respectively, worldwide (UNESCO 2001).\n        \n          \n            North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific\n            publications produced annually.\n          \n        \n        It is rather obvious that richer countries are able to invest more resources in science\n        and therefore account for the largest number of publications. It is also likely that there\n        is a statistical bias on the part of the SCI as a bibliometric database, since it\n        represents North American and European publications far better than those of the rest of\n        the world (Gibbs 1995; May 1997; Alonso and Fern\u00e1ndez-Juricic 2001; Vohora and Vohora\n        2001). But is the disparity in scientific contributions between the developed and\n        developing worlds actually remaining unchanged or even increasing, as Mr. Annan has\n        implied? A closer look at the trends over the last decade reveals important advances in\n        developing countries. For example, Latin America and China, although representing,\n        respectively, only 1.8% and 2% of scientific publications worldwide, have increased the\n        number of their publications between 1990 and 1997 by 36% and 70%, respectively, which is a\n        much higher percentage than the increments reached by Europe (10%) and industrial Asia\n        (26%). The percentage of global scientific publications from North America actually\n        decreased by 8% over the same period (UNESCO 2001).\n      \n      \n        Publishing Trends in the Americas\n        Using the SCI databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), as\n        well as data compiled by the Red Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda\n        (RICYT), we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific\n        publications between the developed world and the developing world from 1990 until 2000,\n        focusing on the Americas as a case study. Not surprisingly, there was a huge disparity in\n        the number of publications from 1990 until 2000, with the United States contributing the\n        lion's share (84.2%), followed by Canada (10.35%). Latin America as a whole contributed\n        only 5.45% to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years (RICYT\n        2002).\n        The total number of publications, however, is not necessarily the best measure for\n        assessing scientific productivity or technical advances (May 1997). More relevant\n        measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of\n        publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research\n        and development (May 1997). The proportional change in the number of publications, using\n        1990 as a comparison, revealed that scientific publishing in Latin America increased the\n        most rapidly in the Americas, far outpacing the United States and Canada (Figure 1).\n        Further analyses, correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money\n        invested in research and development for each region, also show that, in contrast to both\n        Canada and United States, the trend in Latin America has been an increase in relative\n        output throughout the 1990s (Figure 2). Moreover, when taking into account the amount of\n        research money available to researchers, Latin America actually out-published the United\n        States and Canada by the year 2000 (Figure 2). Although the cost of research is undoubtedly\n        cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries, overhead and\n        other work standards, these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number\n        of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in Latin America,\n        particularly from 1995 until 2000 (Figure 2).\n        Other relative indicators of scientific productivity, such as the number of publications\n        picked up by the SCI in relation to the number of scientists in a particular country, also\n        demonstrate that such developing regions as Latin America are making substantial\n        contributions to science, despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic\n        product (GDP) invested in science in Latin America throughout this 10-year period was only\n        21% of the amount invested in United States (RICYT 2002). Indeed, this scientific\n        productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science\n        itself as compared with the GDP of Latin America as a whole. In fact, Albornoz (2001)\n        concluded that, as a group, Latin America could afford to invest a much higher proportion\n        of its resources in scientific research and development. Latin American investment in\n        research and development represented only 0.59% of the regional GDP in 1998, a very weak\n        effort compared with that of the United States (2.84%) and Canada (1.5%).\n        Among Latin American countries, there is a high degree of variability in publication\n        rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology. Some countries have\n        performed particularly well. For example, Uruguay, Chile, Panama, and Cuba averaged,\n        respectively, 6.8, 5.3, 5.2, and 3.4 publications per million dollars of research and\n        development investment in the 10 years studied, which is notoriously high compared with\n        United States (1.5) and even Canada (3.3) (RICYT 2002). Other countries, such as Costa\n        Rica, Cuba, Brazil, and Chile, have invested a much greater proportion of their GDP in\n        research and development than the other countries of this region (Albornoz 2001).\n        \n          \n            Why has the number of publications per dollar invested in research and\n            development been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in United States and\n            Canada?\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Explaining the Increase in Publishing Productivity in Latin America\n        One potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in Latin America\n        is that scientific development during the 1990s was particularly strong for many countries\n        of this region. Indeed, this would explain the rapid rise in the number of publications in\n        Latin America compared with the relatively flat increases in the United States and Canada,\n        which were publishing just as well at the beginning of the decade. A potentially more\n        important question, however, is why the number of publications per dollar invested in\n        research and development has been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in the\n        United States and Canada. This pattern could be the result of a variety of factors, none of\n        which are mutually exclusive. It is possible that publishing in international journals as a\n        measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in Latin America. Increased\n        funding to the most productive scientists from the national science development programs\n        might have been an important stimulus. International cooperation resulting in more\n        scientific collaborations among scientists in Latin America, Europe, and the United States\n        may also have increased the relative number of publications in Latin America. In contrast,\n        the decreasing trends in the number of publications per investment dollar in Canada and\n        United States could reflect a trend towards more costly research in larger scientific\n        programs.\n      \n      \n        Scientific Impact from Latin America\n        What, exactly, is the relative impact of such developing regions as Latin America on the\n        scientific community? We used SCI 2001 data to examine the proportion of publications in\n        the area of ecology (including the fields of evolutionary biology, conservation biology,\n        and global change biology) between 1990 and 2002 in both the two top general science\n        journals (\n        Nature and \n        Science ; with impact factors of 27.96 and 23.33, respectively) and in\n        the 20 top ecological journals (with impact factors of 10.51\u20132.47) (ISI 2001a). We credited\n        a region with a publication if any of the authors were affiliated with institutions from\n        that region. Thus, more than one region would receive credit for a single publication if\n        that publication had been written by multiple authors from institutions of different\n        regions.\n        For the top 20 ecological journals, the American subcontinents of South, Central, and\n        North America accounted for 62% of the publications worldwide. Within the Americas,\n        however, Latin America represented only 6%, while Canada and United States accounted,\n        respectively, for 13% and 82% of the top 20 ecological publications. When we examined the\n        data as contributions to the top 10 ecological journals (impact factors 10.51\u20133.31) versus\n        the top 11\u201320 (impact factors 3.28\u20132.47), the Latin American countries contributed nearly\n        twice as many publications to journals in the second category (8% in the top 11\u201320 compared\n        with 4% in the top 10). These findings suggest that publications from such developing\n        regions as Latin America are falling short of reaching the top journals. In contrast, the\n        United States contributed somewhat more publications to the top 10 journals (84%) than the\n        top 11\u201320 journals (79%). The difference in the proportion of publications contributed by\n        the United States to the top 10 and top 20 journals was even more pronounced when we\n        examined it in respect to worldwide publications. In this case, the United States\n        contributed 60% of the publications to the top 10 journals and only 40% of the publications\n        to the top 11\u201320 journals.\n        Interestingly, the proportion of publications from Latin America, the United States, and\n        Canada across all subject areas in \n        Science and \n        Nature were nearly identical to those of the top 20 ecological journals.\n        In \n        Science and \n        Nature , Latin America had 7% of the publications within the Americas\n        versus 6% in the top 20 ecological journals, whereas the United States and Canada had 81%\n        versus 82% and 12% versus 13%, respectively. These similarities suggest that the Latin\n        American researchers are not shying away from the two top-ranked general science journals.\n        However, publishing in \n        Science and \n        Nature was not enough to gain prominence, as evidenced by the number of\n        citations of these researchers. The latest list of the 247 most-cited researchers in\n        ecology and environmental sciences emphasizes the overwhelming contributions of authors\n        from North America (73%) and Europe (21%) (ISI 2001b). No researcher working in a Latin\n        American institution was included in the remaining 6%. Overall, these data indicate that\n        the scientific output in the field of ecology in Latin America is having a relatively low\n        impact in the international scientific community and is underrepresented in the top\n        international journals, despite its robust productivity as measured by the number of\n        publications per researcher funding amount. Similar findings were also reported for Asia\n        (Swinbanks et al. 1997) and thus could be a general phenomenon in the developing world.\n        Although there are outstanding scientific researchers in the developing world who\n        independently are making important contributions to the international scientific community,\n        they are the exception. Why, in general, do Latin American scientists often fail to reach\n        the top journals or become amongst the most cited researchers in their fields? One\n        possibility is that the main research agendas between both regions are somewhat different\n        and that the top journals, which are published in the developed world, respond more to the\n        scientific mainstream of the developed regions. This is not to suggest any sort of\n        conspiracy, but rather it implies that the perception of the most important science is\n        linked to the region and that because the major funding agencies as well as most prominent\n        journals share a similar economic region, they also share the same perception of what\n        science is most interesting to them. Another consideration is that more local journals from\n        developed regions are listed by the SCI than similar journals from developing regions\n        (Gibbs 1995). Consequently, there are more high-profile regional publication opportunities\n        available to scientists from the developed region, whereas much of the research published\n        locally in the developing world is overlooked. But it takes more than publishing good\n        papers to become a highly cited scientist. It requires attending international meetings and\n        introducing novel research findings in multiple scientific forums. Funding these\n        activities, however, requires a greater proportion of research money being spent on\n        meetings for researchers in the developing compared with the developed world.\n      \n      \n        A Long Road Yet to Travel\n        The positive trends in scientific productivity in Latin America should not be\n        misinterpreted as a reason to be unconcerned about the existing gap highlighted by Mr.\n        Annan. There are many compelling reasons for the push to increase scientific input from the\n        developing world (Goldemberg 1998; Annan 2003). One is that science, as a discipline, would\n        benefit from the contributions of many disparate groups around the world, rather than being\n        dominated by two geographic regions. Many scientific problems could be solved much more\n        readily with the cooperation and scientific insight of scientists from developing regions.\n        Climate change and biodiversity research, for example, urgently need the scientific input\n        from those developing regions that are so important for these global processes. It is also\n        critical for the developing world to promote, through research and publications, those\n        areas of concern that are having a proportionally greater scientific and social impact upon\n        them. There are now examples in which research on priority areas for the developing nations\n        can actually become pioneering work in areas neglected by the research agenda of the\n        industrialized world. This has been the case for research on renewable energy sources in\n        Brazil (Goldemberg 1998) and biomedical sciences in Cuba (Castro D\u00edaz-Balart 2002). These\n        examples are important not only for those regions of the developing world, but are also in\n        themselves scientific innovations that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the\n        world.\n        \n          \n            Climate change and biodiversity research urgently need the scientific\n            input from those developing regions that are so important for global processes.\n          \n        \n        Although the evidence presented here demonstrates that there is a long way to go before\n        developing countries contribute a more equitable share to the international scientific\n        community, there are also reasons to be optimistic. The relative increase in the number of\n        publications, especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and\n        development, demonstrates that many developing countries are heading in the right\n        direction. The extremely high scientific productivity of many developing nations, corrected\n        for and despite the rather limited availability of funds, suggests that increased funding\n        to the sciences will be an excellent investment by developing nations in terms of\n        publications as a measure of scientific output, particularly if these publications can\n        target the journals that have the greatest impact. Although there may still be a long road\n        to travel, we feel optimistic that the bridges mentioned by Mr. Annan are slowly being\n        built.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "journal.pbio.0020001", "class": "technical"}

Does it apply to many other global health\n        risks? The study by Anthony Rodgers and colleagues suggests that it does.\n        To develop effective health policies, one must understand the existing health risks and\n        disease burdens. On a worldwide scale, this is a tough challenge. The Global Burden of\n        Disease Database, maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), collects data from\n        countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco, malnutrition, childhood abuse,\n        unsafe sex, childbirth, and cholesterol levels, as well as on disease burdens, for example\n        depression, blindness, and diarrhea. A large group of scientists from all over the world\n        has developed a framework to analyze these data. To compare different risks or burdens,\n        they calculate disability-adjusted life-years, or DALYs\u2014the number of healthy life years\n        lost because of a particular disease or risk factor.\n        Rodgers and colleagues used data from the WHO database for 26 risk factors and from 14\n        epidemiological subregions of the world to calculate the proportion of\n        risk-factor-attributable disease burden in different population subgroups defined by age,\n        sex, and exposure level. For being underweight in childhood, for example\u2014the leading risk\n        factor for global loss of healthy life\u2014they found that only 35% of the disease burden\n        occurred in severely underweight children, the rest occurred in those only moderately\n        underweight. The relative risks for the moderately underweight are much lower, but the\n        number of children in that category is so large that the total attributable burden amounted\n        to almost two-thirds of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor.\n        The analysis confirms\u2014and extends to a global level\u2014previous research showing that many\n        major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels, not just among\n        individuals exposed to high levels of risk. It also points to risk factors that are\n        particularly prevalent among specific populations and age groups, and for which highly\n        targeted interventions could be effective.\n        Despite numerous caveats and limitations of studies like this one, such analyses are\n        essential aids in guiding the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life\n        years lost to premature death and disability.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "pmed.0010029", "class": "technical"}

Lung fibroblasts respond, \n        in vitro , to inflammatory cytokines\n        by producing growth factors and collagen, resulting in\n        fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix\n        deposition [ 2 3 4 ] . In addition, activated lung\n        fibroblasts have been shown to produce large amounts of\n        inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, \n        in vitro , and hence, these cells may\n        also have a role as effector-inflammatory cells [ 1 2 ] .\n        This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic\n        factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung\n        fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target\n        cells, via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, perpetuating\n        the fibrotic process [ 2 ] .\n        Prostanoids are important regulators of fibroblast\n        function [ 5 6 7 8 9 ] . Prostaglandin (PG)E \n        2 is thought to have antifibrotic\n        properties \n        in vitro , but also can have\n        proinflammatory effects both \n        in vivo and \n        in vitro [ 10 11 12 ] . Thromboxane\n        (TX)A \n        2 increases proliferation, and DNA and\n        RNA synthesis in several cell types, including fibroblasts\n        and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells [ 13 14\n        15 16 ] . Conversely, prostacyclin (PGI \n        2 ) decreases smooth muscle cell\n        proliferation and collagen synthesis [ 17 18 ] .\n        Many cell types, including lung fibroblasts, contain\n        cyclooxygenase (COX), a proximal enzyme in prostanoid\n        production, and can generate prostanoids [ 19 ] . It has\n        been previously reported that IPF lung fibroblasts have\n        decreased COX-2 expression compared to normal lung\n        fibroblasts and, hence, have decreased PGE \n        2 production [ 12 20 21 ] . Because of\n        these findings and the fact that PGs are important\n        fibroblast regulators, we sought to investigate whether\n        abnormalities in COX-2 expression could be associated with\n        an altered balance between profibrotic and antifibrotic\n        PGs. We hypothesized that fibroblasts from the lungs of\n        patients with IPF (HF-IPF) have an altered PG balance\n        compared to normal lung fibroblasts (HF-NL). This\n        phenotypical abnormality could be an important factor in\n        the pathogenesis of IPF.\n      \n      \n        Materials and methods\n        \n          Primary lung fibroblasts\n          Fibroblasts from the lungs of seven patients (6 males)\n          with IPF (HF-IPF) were harvested: a) from excised lung at\n          the time of lung transplantation; b) during an autopsy\n          performed within 4 hours from death; or c) during open or\n          transbronchial lung biopsies at the time of diagnosis. Of\n          the seven patients, five subjects had advanced lung\n          fibrosis and were receiving prednisone \u00b1\n          immunosuppressive agents; 2 patients were at an earlier\n          stage of their disease and were not receiving\n          immunosuppressive drugs. The mean age of the patients was\n          59 (range 43-71)]. HF-NL were cultured from five human\n          lungs that arrived at our transplant center with the\n          intention of being used for transplantation, but for\n          various reasons could not be transplanted; these were\n          macroscopically and microscopically normal. The cells\n          were harvested and cultured as per the protocol described\n          by Kumar \n          et al. [ 22 ] . Briefly, lung\n          tissue sections were finely cut with sterile scissors and\n          incubated with serum free DMEM containing trypsin, DNAse\n          and collagenase for 30 min. The procedure was repeated\n          twice, and the supernatants were pooled and cultured in\n          one 100 mm plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO \n          2 humidified atmosphere. Culture\n          medium (DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum [FBS] and\n          penicillin/streptomycin) was replaced three times per\n          week and fibroblasts were passed (1:2 split) at the time\n          they became confluent.

All\n          the experiments were conducted with cells at passages 6\n          to 8.\n        \n        \n          Inducible cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and\n          eicosanoid production\n          COX-2 activity was determined by measuring PGE \n          2 , 6-keto-PGF \n          1\u03b1 (stable PGI \n          2 metabolite), TXB \n          2 (stable TXA \n          2 metabolite), and PGF \n          2\u03b1 production in stimulated\n          fibroblasts. HF-IPF (n = 7) and HF-NL (n = 5) were\n          brought to >90% confluency in 100mm plates and then\n          placed on serum free DMEM for 24 hours to render them\n          quiescent. Fibroblasts were then incubated in DMEM with\n          5% FBS alone or in the same medium with IL-1\u03b2 (2.5 ng/ml)\n          for 24 hours. At the end of the incubation period the\n          supernatant was aspirated and fresh media containing 30\n          \u03bcM of arachidonic acid was added to the plates. After 30\n          min of incubation the supernatant was collected and saved\n          at -70\u00b0C for later eicosanoid analysis. The cells were\n          then resuspended and divided into two aliquots, which\n          were used for RNA and protein extractions, respectively.\n          The above experiments were repeated in HF-IPF (n = 2) and\n          HF-NL (n = 2) using serum free media conditions.\n          Prostanoids were measured by modified stable isotope\n          dilution assays that used gas chromatography-negative\n          ion-chemical ionization mass spectrometry as previously\n          described [ 23 ] . Briefly, deuterium-labeled internal\n          standards of PGE \n          2 , PGF \n          2\u03b1 , TXB \n          2 , and 6-keto-PGF \n          1\u03b1 were added to the supernatants with\n          isopropyl alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol was removed by\n          evaporation under nitrogen. After acidification to pH\n          3.5, the samples were extracted on preconditioned C-18\n          PrepSep columns (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), and\n          eluted with ethyl acetate. The extract was then converted\n          to a pentafluorobenzyl ester by treatment with a mixture\n          of 12.5% pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile and\n          disopropylethylamine at room temperature for 30 min.\n          After evaporation of reagents, the residue was subjected\n          to TLC plates, using the solvent system\n          chloroform/ethanol (93:7, vol/vol) for PGF \n          2\u03b1 and TXB \n          2 , and ethyl acetate/methanol (93:2,\n          vol/vol) for 6-keto-PGF \n          1\u03b1 and PGE \n          2 . Then PGF \n          2\u03b1 was converted to trimethylsilyl\n          ether derivative by treatment with N,O-bis\n          (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide and\n          dimethylformamide. The methoxime derivative of TXB \n          2 , PGE \n          2 and 6-keto-PGF \n          1\u03b1 was made by treatment with 2%\n          methoxamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 70\u00b0C for 60 min,\n          followed by evaporation of the pyridine, addition of\n          water, and extraction with ethyl acetate. Derivatization\n          was completed by formation of the trimethylsilyl\n          derivatives by treatment with N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl)\n          trifluoroacetamide and pyridine. Eicosanoids were\n          quantified by measuring the ratio of the intensity of\n          ions m/z 569/573 for PGF \n          2\u03b1 , m/z 614/618 for TXB \n          2 and 6-keto-PGF \n          1\u03b1 , and m/z 524/528 for PGE \n          2 . An analytical blank for each of\n          these products was determined by measuring the amount of\n          nondeuterated material, detected after extracting and\n          analyzing 2 ml of saline to which the deuterium-labeled\n          internal standards had been added.\n        \n        \n          Western analysis\n          After washing with PBS at pH 7.4, pellets were lyzed\n          in solubilization buffer containing 50 mM TRIS at pH 8,\n          1% Tween 20, 10 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride,\n          diethyldithiocarbamic acid, leupeptin and pepstatin A\n          (all from Sigma Chemical), sonicated, boiled with gel\n          loading buffer (62.5 mM TRIS-HCl, at pH 6.8, 10%\n          glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and bromophenol\n          blue), and centrifuged at 15,000 x \n          g for 10 min. Equal amounts of\n          protein (70 to 100 \u03bcg) were separated by electrophoresis.\n          SDS-PAGE was performed using a 7.5% separating gel with a\n          4% stacking gel. The resolved proteins were transferred\n          electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes\n          (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Corp.). After transfer, the filters\n          were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a blocking solution\n          (20 mM TRIS base, 137 mM sodium chloride at pH 7.6, 5%\n          powdered milk, 3% BSA), and incubated with primary\n          polyclonal rabbit antibodies against COX-2 at a dilution\n          1:1000 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), for 1 hour at\n          room temperature. The filters were washed (TBS-0.1% Tween\n          20 at pH 7.6) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase\n          linked secondary antibodies at a dilution 1:4000\n          (Amersham). After washing, the membranes were incubated\n          with luminol based chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont NEN\n          Research Products, Boston, MA).\n        \n        \n          Northern analysis\n          Cell pellets were lyzed and RNA extracted using the\n          RNeasy method \u00ae(Qiagen), following the manufacturer's\n          instructions. RNA was quantified by determining light\n          absorbance at 260 nm and then fractioned by\n          electrophoresis (10 \u03bcg per lane) on a 1% agarose\n          MOPS/formaldehyde gel. The RNA was denatured prior to\n          loading by incubating the RNA at 65\u00b0C for 10 min in a\n          loading buffer comprising 1X MOPS, 50% formamide, 6.5%\n          formaldehyde, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.025%\n          bromophenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol. The RNA was\n          transferred by gravity-assisted capillary method with 6X\n          SSC to nylon hybridization membrane, and then fixed to\n          the membrane by UV crosslinking (Stratalinker 1200 \u03bcj/cm\n          2). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at\n          42\u00b0C and using Quick Hyb \u00ae(Stratagene) as hybridization\n          solution. The COX-2 probe was random primed following the\n          directions of the manufacturer (Megaprime \u00ae,\n          Amersham/Pharmacia). The membrane was then washed at a\n          final stringency of 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 60\u00b0C for 30\n          min. The membrane was wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed\n          to Kodak XR film at -70\u00b0C with intensifier screen\n          overnight.\n        \n        \n          Statistical methods\n          All results are presented as medians with their range.\n          Comparisons between HF-IPF and HF-NL were done using the\n          Mann-Whitney test. A \n          P value of <0.05 was considered\n          significant.\n        \n      \n      \n        Results\n        \n          Baseline and stimulated COX-2 activity in HF-IPF\n          and HF-NL\n          Unstimulated eicosanoid production was similar in both\n          HF-IPF and HF-NL (Fig. 1, a-d). When fibroblasts were\n          stimulated with IL-1\u03b2 there was a significant and similar\n          upregulation of PGE \n          2 production in both HF-IPF and HF-NL\n          (28.35 [range: 9.09-89.09] versus 17.12 [8.58-29.33]\n          ng/10 6cells/30 min, respectively; \n          P = 0.25; [Fig. 1a]).\n          IL-1\u03b2-stimulated production of TXB \n          2 (stable metabolite of the active TXA\n          \n          2 ), PGF \n          2\u03b1 , and 6-keto-PGF \n          1\u03b1 (stable metabolite of PGI \n          2 ) increased modestly in every case,\n          except TXB \n          2 production by HF-NL, which decreased\n          (0.75 [0.15-2.58] ng/10 6cells/30 min at baseline versus\n          0.61 [0.21-1.64] ng/10 6cells/30 min with IL-1\u03b2\n          stimulation) (Fig. 1b). Results of PGE \n          2 production were similar when\n          experiments were conducted in serum free media conditions\n          (results not shown).\n          IL-1\u03b2 stimulated TXB \n          2 production was significantly greater\n          in HF-IPF (1.92 [1.27-2.57] ng/10 6cells/30 min) than in\n          HF-NL (0.61 [0.21-1.64] ng/10 6cells/30 min; \n          P = 0.007) (Fig. 1b); baseline TXB \n          2 production was not significantly\n          different between the two cell groups (1.73 [0.77-2.53]\n          versus 0.75 [0.15-2.58] ng/10 6cells/30 min, in HF-IPF\n          and HF-NL, respectively; \n          P = 0.17 [Fig. 1b]). Because PGI \n          2 and TXA \n          2 have opposing effects \n          in vivo , we calculated the ratio\n          of their metabolites (6-keto-PGF \n          1\u03b1 :TXB \n          2 ) and found a significantly lower\n          ratio in HF-IPF at baseline (0.08 [0.04-0.52] versus 0.12\n          [0.11-0.89] in HF-IPF and HF-NL, respectively; \n          P = 0.028) and a similar trend\n          under stimulated conditions (0.24 [0.05-1.53] versus 1.08\n          [0.51-3.79] in HF-IPF and HF-NL, respectively; \n          P = 0.09 [Fig. 2]).\n        \n        \n          Baseline and stimulated COX-2 expression\n          Western blot in unstimulated fibroblasts showed no\n          detectable COX-2 protein in either group of cells, while\n          IL-1\u03b2 significantly induced COX-2 to a similar degree in\n          IPF and normal lung fibroblasts (Fig. 3). Northern blot\n          showed minimal COX-2 mRNA in unstimulated cells and\n          significant upregulation of COX-2 mRNA expression when\n          stimulated with IL-1\u03b2 in both HF-IPF and HF-NL (Fig.\n          4).\n        \n      \n      \n        Discussion\n        Several factors modulate fibroblast proliferation and\n        collagen production, including mitogenic cytokines (e.g.,\n        transforming growth factor \u03b2 [TGF\u03b2], platelet-derived\n        growth factor [PDGF], basic fibroblast growth factor\n        [bFGF]), eicosanoids (i.e., PGE \n        2 , TXB \n        2 , and PGI \n        2 ), and antifibrogenic cytokines (e.g.\n        IFN-\u03b3) [ 1 2 3 ] . It is very likely that a complex\n        interaction among these factors exists in the tissue repair\n        process, and it is possible that pathologic fibrosis, as in\n        IPF, results from phenotypical alterations in fibroblasts\n        that affect the \"normal\" interaction of these factors.\n        Our results show that stimulation of primary cultures of\n        human lung fibroblasts with the proximal cytokine IL-1\u03b2\n        upregulates COX-2 protein and mRNA expression to a similar\n        degree in normal and IPF fibroblasts. TXA \n        2 production tended to be greater in IPF\n        than in normal fibroblasts at baseline; when stimulated\n        with IL-1\u03b2 this difference became statistically\n        significant. The ratio of PGI \n        2 to TXA \n        2 metabolites was lower in IPF\n        fibroblasts at baseline and with IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. The\n        above results suggest that a decreased PGI \n        2 :TXA \n        2 ratio could be a phenotypic alteration\n        present in IPF fibroblasts, resulting in a loss of their\n        capacity to autoregulate proliferation and extracellular\n        matrix production.\n        The effects of PGs on cell proliferation and collagen\n        production have been widely studied in different cell types\n        [ 13 14 15 16 17 26 ] . TXA \n        2 has been studied extensively because\n        of its apparent role in atherosclerosis, due to its\n        prothrombotic and mitogenic activities on vascular smooth\n        muscle cells [ 15 16 ] . These mitogenic effects are\n        potentiated by growth factors [ 15 16 27 28 ] . In vascular\n        smooth muscle cells TXA \n        2 stimulates synthesis of bFGF and\n        increases the expression of the proto-oncogenes \n        c-fos , \n        c-myc , and \n        egr-1 , which are associated with\n        entry into the cell growth cycle [ 15 ] . In addition, TXA \n        2 increases proliferation of fibroblasts\n        [ 13 ] and smooth muscle-like glomerular mesangial cells [\n        14 ] .\n        On the other hand, PGI \n        2 decreases vascular smooth muscle cell\n        proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycane\n        synthesis, via activation of adenylyl cyclase and\n        subsequent production of cAMP [ 17 ] . Betaprost, an analog\n        of PGI \n        2 , decreases procollagen I and III mRNA\n        expression in cardiac fibroblasts [ 18 ] . These effects\n        may counteract the profibrotic effects seen with TXA \n        2 and it is possible that an alteration\n        of a \"normal\" physiologic balance between PGI \n        2 and TXA \n        2 could increase tendency towards\n        fibrogenesis.\n        It is important to mention that our experiments were\n        conducted at similar passage levels (passage 6 to 8) in\n        both groups, since senescence of fibroblasts is associated\n        with a shift from the biosynthesis of PGI \n        2 to TXA \n        2 [ 24 25 ] . It is possible that the\n        difference seen in our study between HF-IPF and HF-NL could\n        result from comparing fibroblasts of different ages. HF-IPF\n        might have been harvested from fibrotic lesions where\n        fibroblasts had previously undergone a greater number of\n        cell divisions than HF-NL, obtained from nonfibrotic lungs.\n        Although this is a possibility, the age-related shift in PG\n        production has only been shown at very high cell passages\n        and has not been documented \n        in vivo .\n        We also found that both HF-IPF and HF-NL had similar PGE\n        \n        2 production at baseline, and a similar\n        increase when stimulated with IL-1\u03b2. PGE \n        2 can decrease fibroblast proliferation\n        and collagen synthesis, and increase collagen degradation [\n        5 6 7 8 ] .\n        Recent reports suggesting decreased COX-2 expression and\n        PGE \n        2 production in IPF fibroblasts have\n        received significant attention [ 12 20 21 ] . In our study\n        we found that both COX-2 protein expression and PGE \n        2 production were upregulated to a\n        similar degree in IPF and normal lung fibroblasts. We\n        believe that differences in methodology and patient\n        selection may explain the discrepancies with other studies.\n        Vancheri and collaborators [ 20 ] found that\n        TNF-\u03b1-stimulated fibrotic lung fibroblasts had decreased\n        COX-2 expression and PGE \n        2 production, but they further showed\n        that these findings were a result of decreased expression\n        of TNF-\u03b1 receptors. The latter finding would argue against\n        a primary defect in COX-2 expression, since no other\n        stimulus, other than TNF-\u03b1, was tested. In another study,\n        Keerthisingam \n        et al. [ 21 ] reported that fibrotic\n        lung fibroblasts had decreased COX-2 expression and PGE \n        2 production in response to TGF\u03b2\n        stimulation. This study differed from ours in that a\n        different stimulus was used. Of significance is the fact\n        that the COX-2 gene is known to be NF-\u03baB dependent, and\n        IL-1\u03b2, but not TGF\u03b2, is a potent inducer of NF-\u03baB\n        activation. Hence, the pathway involved in the induction of\n        the COX-2 gene by IL-1\u03b2 and TGF\u03b2 may be different.\n        Furthermore, a significant proportion of the fibroblasts\n        used in the study by Keerthisingam \n        et al. [ 21 ] were obtained from\n        patients with systemic sclerosis, which makes their\n        fibroblast population more heterogeneous.\n        Wilborn \n        et al. [ 12 ] also reported a\n        decreased production of PGE \n        2 by IL-1\u03b2-stimulated IPF fibroblasts,\n        due to decreased COX-2 expression [ 12 ] . There is a\n        possibility that patient selection may have differed\n        between the two studies. However, we feel certain that the\n        diagnostic accuracy of our patient population was high, due\n        to the fact that 5 out of a total of 7 IPF subjects\n        included in our study underwent lung transplantation with\n        confirmatory pathology results consistent with IPF. The\n        other 2 subjects had biopsy-proven IPF. In addition, our\n        results were similar when comparing lung fibroblasts\n        obtained from 5 subjects with advanced stage IPF with those\n        of 2 subjects at an earlier stage of their disease, who had\n        received no therapy. Although the reasons for our different\n        results are unclear, the fact that we found similar COX-2\n        expression and PGE \n        2 production in normal and IPF lung\n        fibroblasts suggests that loss of COX-2 expression is not a\n        universal characteristic of fibroblasts cultured from the\n        lungs of subjects with IPF.\n      \n      \n        Conclusion\n        We have found that fibroblasts cultured from normal and\n        IPF human lungs have a significant and similar induction of\n        the COX-2 enzyme when stimulated with IL-1\u03b2, but that IPF\n        fibroblasts produced more thromboxane and had a\n        significantly lower prostacyclin:thromboxane ratio. We\n        hypothesize that the lower PGI \n        2 :TXA \n        2 ratio seen in HF-IPF may be a\n        phenotypic alteration that plays a role in the pathogenesis\n        of IPF.\n      \n      \n        Abbreviations\n        COX = cyclooxygenase; HF = human fibroblasts; NL =\n        normal lungs; IPF = idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; IFN =\n        interferon; IL = interleukin; PG = prostaglandin; TX =\n        thromboxane; PGI \n        2 = prostacyclin.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "rr166", "class": "technical"}

Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that\n        were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands,\n        marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring.\n        Around 7000 b.c. , the Phoenicians set out from what is now\n        Iran to explore their surroundings. They eventually reached the\n        islands, and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part\n        of the Aegean Sea.

Obsidian is a hard, vitreous\n        volcanic rock, which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and\n        stabbing. The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area\n        remained popular with early travelers.\n        The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come\n        together as early as 5000 b.c. , and were already in place by the late\n        Bronze Age (c. 2700 b.c. ). The major changes were not to daily tasks\n        and routines, but to the political power base, which changed regularly\n        and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages.\n        Cycladic Culture\n        At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the\n        Cyclades islands. The distinctive, sculpted marble figures of the era\n        are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs. You will find\n        original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the\n        Cyclades, although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on\n        Paros. The people farmed and fished; on the dawning of the Bronze Age\n        in 2700 b.c. , they began to work with metals. The Cycladic culture was\n        influenced by societies in the east, importing the pottery wheel from\n        Mesopotamia. They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local\n        marble.\n        The Minoans and the Myceneans\n        Farther south in Crete, the Minoan culture developed after\n        2000 b.c. into the most significant of its age, spreading its influence\n        throughout the region by trade and diplomacy. Santorini (Thira), the\n        next major island north, was heavily influenced by Crete, and the\n        settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time. The magnificent\n        frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present, but\n        the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the\n        sophistication of the culture here.\n        Around 1500 b.c. , a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini\n        destroyed not only Akrotiri\u2002\u2014\u2002under feet of ash and pumice\u2002\u2014\u2002but the\n        whole Minoan civilization. Massive tidal waves swept over Crete, and\n        other parts of the Mediterranean, smashing buildings and drowning many\n        thousands of people.\n        In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the Aegean\n        Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans (at around 1300\n        b.c. ), who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland.\n        The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer, not to\n        trade. Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by\n        Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad.\n        The Rise of Athens\n        The Dorians, who came overland from northern Europe,\n        conquered the Mycenaeans. They were a barbaric race, and their custody\n        of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word\n        was forgotten and art disappeared. They held sway over islands off the\n        northern Greek coast, but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea\n        routes; south of the area, trade continued as usual. At the same time,\n        city-states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland.\n        Athens became the most powerful, heralding the start of the classical\n        Greek period. However, Greece was not yet a country; each city-state\n        was self-governing and autonomous.\n        The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean, helped\n        by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements\n        such as Carthage, a Greek city on the African coast of the\n        Mediterranean. Culture and the arts flourished once again. Athletic\n        prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in 776 b.c.\n        , to promote friendly competition. Homer wrote his epic works on Chios;\n        and lyrical poetry was much admired, particularly the work of the poets\n        Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos.\n        The preeminent islands of this era were Delos, a sacred\n        island and center of religion ruled by Athens; Samos, ruled by the\n        tyrant Polycrates; and Naxos, whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major\n        building projects. Archaeology shows that, during this time, societies\n        lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement\n        inland.\n        The Persian Wars\n        As Athens rose in influence and power in the West, it was\n        matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire. From a power\n        base in Anatolia, the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and\n        set their sights on the Cyclades. In 490 b.c. , they captured sacred\n        Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos. The island communities were\n        undecided about which side to back for a time. Paros and Andros\n        contributed to the Persian armory, while others supported Athens. The\n        two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and\n        Salamis in 480 b.c. The Persians were defeated, and Athens duly\n        punished the islands that had turned against it.\n        Following its victory, Athens introduced the concept of a\n        mutual protection alliance (a kind of NATO of the ancient world).\n        Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together, and\n        created a treasury to fund their plans, which was held on the island of\n        Delos. The alliance became known as the Delian League. Although there\n        were minor internal wrangles, the league controlled the Aegean and the\n        greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b.c. Later, in\n        454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were\n        used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and\n        temples of the Classical Age.\n        In 431 b.c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and\n        league member Sparta. Although the islands saw little action, as the\n        war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power.\n        Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already\n        transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by Philip II\n        of Macedon. He was followed in 336 b.c. by his son Alexander the Great,\n        one of the most remarkable leaders in history. His rise to power\n        ushered in the Hellenistic period.\n        Hellenistic and Roman Periods\n        When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east\n        as India, the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes.\n        Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire. Following\n        Alexander\u2019s death, his lands were divided among his generals. Much of\n        the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies, along with Egypt.\n        Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan.\n        Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and\n        successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands,\n        the next major power change brought influence from the West. The Greek\n        Hellenistic Empire was gradually, and peacefully, absorbed into the\n        Roman Empire.\n        The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity\n        The Romans ruled a pagan empire, but the Aegean had an\n        important influence on the early development of Christianity. In a.d. \u2002\n        95, St. John arrived on Patmos, a small rocky island in the Dodecanese,\n        as a political prisoner. It was here that he wrote what was to become\n        the final book of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation. It wasn\u2019t\n        until a.d. 330, however, when the newly converted Emperor Constantine\n        made Byzantium, renamed Constantinople, capital of his Eastern Empire\n        that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek\n        life.\n        The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified\n        cities, but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by\n        waves of invaders. In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen\n        Muslims, a new potent religious force from the East, the Byzantine army\n        forcefully enlisted the men of the islands. Disease took a further\n        toll. By the time of the Crusades, many of the Aegean islands had been\n        practically depopulated.\n        As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first\n        millennium, Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter\n        the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith.\n        Unfortunately, their zeal was not matched by their discrimination. The\n        crusaders swept through the l;and of Byzantium slaughtering Christians\n        as well as Muslims, civilians as well as soldiers. Constantinople was\n        taken by Crusader forces in 1204, and they stripped the city of manyof\n        its finest treasures\u2002\u2014\u2002which now grace the public buildings of\n        Venice\u2002\u2014\u2002although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was\n        transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell.\n        While Byzantine land was being divided, there was no one in\n        control of the seas, so pirates raided towns on many of the islands. To\n        counter this, the populations moved from their homes on the coast and\n        built settlements inland, out of sight of the raiding parties. This\n        created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port\n        (skala) which serves an inland settlement or chora, making it easier to\n        protect the island from attack.\n        The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful\n        European noblemen, many of whom were Genoese or Venetian, such as Marco\n        Sanudo on Naxos. The noblemen had free rein to create their own\n        fiefdoms. The Venetians fortified their main towns\u2002\u2014\u2002Naxos Town and\n        Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this\u2002\u2014\u2002creating labyrinths of\n        narrow alleys and cul-de-sacs that were designed to confuse and to\n        demoralize invaders. The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean\n        Islands, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and\n        trade.\n        After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309,\n        Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land. The Knights of St.\n        John, a holy military force, made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the\n        Dodecanese. They began the process of building their strong citadels,\n        and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands. However, they had\n        not seen the last of their Muslim foe. A force was gaining strength in\n        the east to threaten their new bases.\n        The Coming of the Ottoman Turks\n        The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east,\n        taking land in what is now Turkey. By the end of the 13th century, they\n        began their first raids on the Aegean Islands. In 1453, they took\n        Constantinople, and immediately made it their capital, renaming it\n        Istanbul.\n        They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of\n        St. John and, after an unsuccessful siege in 1480, they finally ejected\n        the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522. In 1566, they wrested Chios\n        from the Genoese, bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands,\n        but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or\n        more\u2002\u2014\u2002Tinos was the last to fall in 1715. The Ottomans brought new\n        influences to the islands that they controlled, forming a large empire\n        that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean.\n        Toward Greek Independence\n        However, a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula\n        against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state. In 1770,\n        Russia came to aid the Greeks (defined by their Orthodox religion\n        rather than by historical geographical boundaries), declaring war on\n        the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774.\n        Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of\n        Antiparos.\n        Although this attempt was unsuccessful, the campaign for a\n        Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in\n        strength. The Aegean Islands played their part. Lesvos, Chios, and\n        Samos lay in the important shipping lanes, and patriots began\n        disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic. In return, the Turks violently put\n        down every insurrection, including the massacre on Chios, when 22,000\n        people were slaughtered.\n        The Ottoman Empire was weakening, however, and in 1821, the\n        peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time.\n        The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this\n        new state. A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout\n        the Aegean, thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the\n        disparate Orthodox populations.\n        The Twentieth Century\n        A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the\n        20th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire. The\n        Turks lost a short war with Italy, and were forced to relinquish the\n        Dodecanese islands to the Italians. Greece took this opportunity to\n        absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add\n        Macedonia to its mainland territories.\n        Following this debacle, the Ottomans then allied themselves\n        to Germany in the World War I, losing more territory with the defeat of\n        the Germans in that war. Greece was handed a strip of land along the\n        western coast of Asia Minor, which for over 2,000 years had had a\n        substantial Greek population. Greece moved in to administer the land,\n        but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part\n        of greater Greece.\n        In 1923, Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers,\n        and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support. He\n        promised a modern state for his people, but as the situation became\n        volatile, civil strife broke out in Turkish cities, and those\n        considered Greek were victims of threats and violence. Many had to\n        leave their birthplaces, fleeing to Lesvos, Chios, and Samos, the\n        Greek-ruled islands just offshore. Thousands of people arrived with\n        little more than the clothes they wore, putting great strain on the\n        resources of the islands. Finally, Greece was ousted from its new\n        territory in Asia Minor, which became part of the new Turkish\n        state.\n        Greece attempted to stay out of World War II, but Mussolini\n        saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire. His forces made\n        a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands,\n        including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town, but\n        they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population\n        against them. Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the\n        islands.\n        After the war, in 1949, the Dodecanese islands finally\n        became part of the Greek nation. But the country was politically\n        fragmented, with arguments between monarchists and republicans, right\n        and left, and tension escalated into civil war. The struggle bypassed\n        most of the islands, although there was fierce fighting on Samos. Even\n        after the fighting stopped more than a decade later, the country was\n        not stable.\n        At the same time, the massive growth in air and road\n        transport saw shipping decline in importance. The Aegean Islands, which\n        for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes, became\n        the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of\n        several islands came close to collapse.\n        In 1967, the military took the reins of power in Athens,\n        and until 1974, the \u201cColonels\u201d held sway with a repressive and brutal\n        regime. Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty\n        and terror, and many made new homes in the United States and Australia.\n        The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism, and Greece\n        along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern\n        Europeans escaping their damp, cool summers.\n        In 1982, Greece joined the European Common Market (now the\n        European Union). Since this time, membership has been of great monetary\n        benefit to the country. The EU has given large subsidies to develop\n        Greece\u2019s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient\n        monuments.\n        Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands,\n        and road systems have been expanded and im proved. Private investment\n        has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible.\n        Politically, the 1990s have been relatively quite times for\n        the islands, although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas\n        Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused\n        consternation within conservative Greek society.\n        As the Balkans flared to war once again, Greek nationalism\n        has stirred, and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the\n        land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers. Whether\n        this will ever happen remains to be seen, but perhaps the aid offered\n        by Greece to Turkey after 1999\u2019s devastating earthquake is a sign that\n        the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to\n        diminish.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "HistoryGreek", "class": "travel-guides"}
{"subclass": null, "text_id": "written/travel-guides/HistoryJerusalem", "text": "\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        A Brief History\n        Jerusalem\u2019s recorded history begins with its mention in\n        Egyptian court records 4,000 years ago, but there had been human\n        settlements here for centuries, probably millennia, before that. At the\n        beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite\n        mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route, far less important than\n        biblical cities such as Hazor, Megiddo, Beth Shean, and Shechem. The\n        earliest name associated with the city, Ur usalim, perhaps meant \u201ccity\n        of Shalim\u201d or \u201cfounded by Shalim. \u201d Scholars speculate that Shalim\n        might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace, for the name\n        resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for \u201cpeace\u201d: shalom and\n        salaam, respectively. If true, this is an ironic name for a city that\n        would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places\n        on the face of the earth.\n        Biblical Jerusalem\n        In the Bible, Genesis 14:18\u201320 records that Abraham visited\n        the city of \u201cSalem\u201d in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the\n        city\u2019s ruler, Melchzedik, who offered him bread and wine. The city is\n        not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet\n        warrior, King David, who captured the city from the Jebusites in about\n        1000 b.c. The Bible describes how David\u2019s soldiers conquered Jerusalem\n        by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the\n        city by surprise. Warren\u2019s Shaft, part of a Canaanite water system\n        discovered by 19th-century archaeologists and open to visitors, might\n        be the very tunnel infiltrated by David\u2019s army.\n        Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not\n        allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel, David made it the\n        capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented\n        artisans, dedicated priests, magical poets and musicians, and the most\n        formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city. He\n        also brought the Ark of the Covenant, the portable tabernacle\n        containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai, to the\n        Spring of Gihon, just outside the walls of Jerusalem. There the Ark\n        rested until it was placed in the Temple, built in approximately 960\n        b.c. on Mt. Moriah, the high point at the northern end of the city.\n        The Temple (today known as the \u201cFirst\u201d Temple) was completed\n        by David\u2019s son and successor, King Solomon. According to biblical\n        tradition, although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully\n        assembled its building materials, he was deemed unworthy of\n        constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his\n        hands. At the Temple\u2019s dedication, Solomon addressed his God: \u201c... the\n        Heavens, even the Heaven of the Heavens, cannot contain Thee; how much\n        less this House that I have built? \u201d\n        The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt.\n        Moriah, on which it stood, where Abraham was called to sacrifice his\n        son Isaac. Along with this splendid house of worship, Solomon built a\n        royal palace, mansions for his wives, temples for the foreign gods\n        worshipped by the princesses he had married, and towers for the defense\n        of the capital. Under the wise reign of Solomon, the city flourished as\n        the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea\n        and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia. The Temple and\n        royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with\n        cedar from Lebanon; the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon\n        have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years. But with\n        his death the empire collapsed, and the Israelite kingdom was divided\n        into two separate, impoverished, often warring nations: Israel, with\n        its capital at Shechem in the north, ruled by a series of northern\n        dynasties; and the smaller kingdom of Judah, with its capital at\n        Jerusalem, from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule. The Bible\n        tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms\n        aroused the fury of the great Prophets.\n        In 701 b.c. the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed\n        Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem. Thanks to King\n        Hezekiah\u2019s hidden water tunnel, the city narrowly escaped destruction.\n        The end of David\u2019s dynasty came in 587 b.c. , when Nebuchadnezzar, King\n        of Babylon, invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem. When it fell, the\n        Temple and all the buildings were burned. The people of the\n        once-glorious city were forced into an exile known as \u201cthe Babylonian\n        Captivity. \u201d\n        In time, the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the\n        Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b.c. The city\n        was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians, but rebuilding\n        was slow work. The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. , but much of\n        the city still lay in ruins.\n        Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in\n        332 b.c. under Alexander the Great and, subsequently, to his\n        Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian\n        Seleucids. When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism, Jews led by Judah\n        Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b.c. and, against\n        all odds, restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem.\n        The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of\n        pagan sacrifices; the eight-day celebration of Hanukkah (Feast of\n        Dedication) commemorates their victory. The Hasmonean dynasty,\n        descendants of the Maccabee family, ruled an independent Jewish\n        Commonwealth that stretched from the Negev to the Galilee. Jerusalem\n        grew, surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside\n        the Jaffa Gate. The Hasmoneans ruled until Pompey\u2019s Roman legions\n        arrived in 63 b.c.\n        Roman Jerusalem\n        After the initial years of Roman administration and\n        political infighting, Rome installed Herod (scion of a family from\n        Idumea, a Jewish kingdom in the desert) as King of Judea. He reigned\n        from 37 to 4 b.c. , during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall\n        and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate, the foundation of\n        which still stand. Several palaces were built and a water system\n        installed. Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple, making it one of\n        the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire. The courtyard\n        around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of\n        pilgrims, and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made\n        with great stone blocks. One of these walls, the Western Wall, is today\n        a major reminder of Jerusalem\u2019s greatness under Herod. A massive\n        fortress was built overlooking the Temple Mount, which Herod named\n        \u201cAntonia\u201d in honor of his Roman friend and benefactor, Mark Antony.\n        For all his accomplishments, Herod was nevertheless hated\n        by his subjects; he taxed, he tortured, and he ordered the massacre of\n        male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah.\n        When Jesus was born in about 4 b.c. , Joseph and Mary escaped Herod\u2019s\n        paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new-born infant. They returned\n        to live in the Galilee village of Nazareth, making pilgrimages to\n        Jerusalem.\n        According to biblical accounts, Jesus spent his life\n        ministering in the Galilee Valley. In about a.d. 30 he and his\n        followers went for Passover to Jerusalem, which was in unrest at this\n        time, dissatisfied with Roman domination. Jesus\u2019s entry into the Temple\n        caused a commotion; after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the\n        temple priests, who were under direct Roman rule. Jesus was put on\n        trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion, a Roman form of execution\n        for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals.\n        In a province rife with rebellion and retaliation, the execution in\n        Jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the Galilee did not by\n        itself have an immediate effect on history.\n        After Jesus\u2019s crucifixion, harsh Roman rule continued until\n        a.d. 66, when the Jews rebelled. For four years Jewish zealots fought\n        against the might of Rome. At the end, the Roman general Titus laid\n        siege to Jerusalem in a.d. 70, finally attacking its starved and\n        weakened defenders. Those who didn\u2019t escape were executed or sold into\n        slavery. The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed. The last of the\n        zealots held out for another three years at Masada (see page 76). Half\n        a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this\n        first revolt against Rome, a number unequaled in ancient warfare.\n        Christian and Islamic Jerusalem\n        For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins, until the Roman\n        Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to\n        Jupiter. In outrage, the Jews began a second revolt against Rome, led\n        by Simon bar Kochba. The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated,\n        but, in the end, Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss\n        of life. The planned new Roman city, Aelia Capitolina, was built over\n        the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem, and Jews were barred from residing\n        there for all time. Jerusalem\u2019s physical existence as a spiritual city\n        seemed finished, but its spiritual power for Jews, and for the\n        struggling new Christian religion, remained. For the next two centuries\n        Aelia Capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history.\n        But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth\n        century, and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again. Queen\n        Helena, a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the\n        Great, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 326 to identify the sites\n        associated with Jesus\u2019s life. She found that the city\u2019s most beautiful\n        Roman temple, dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite, stood on the site of\n        the crucifixion. The temple was demolished and a vast, Classical-style\n        church was built around Golgotha (the hill where Jesus\u2019s crucifixion\n        was believed to have taken place). Throughout Jerusalem, other spots\n        important to Jesus\u2019s life were commemorated with religious structures.\n        Pilgrims came from all over the Roman (and, later, Byzantine) Empire\n        during the following centuries, but the prosperity they brought lasted\n        only until 614, when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced\n        Jerusalem to rubble again. In 629, Jerusalem was recaptured by the\n        Byzantines.\n        Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation,\n        Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam. The Temple Mount\n        was identified in Islamic tradition as \u201cthe farthest spot\u201d (in Arabic,\n        el-aksa), the site to which the Prophet Muhammad was transported in one\n        night from Mecca on a winged horse, as described in the 17th chapter of\n        the Koran. From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was\n        permitted to glimpse paradise. The rock on the Temple Mount from which\n        he ascended, at or close to the site of the ruined Temple, was\n        commemorated by the construction of the Dome of the Rock in 691. The\n        Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalem\u2019s most striking monument; it is\n        counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created. By about 715,\n        the El-Aksa Mosque, third holiest place of prayer in Islam (after Mecca\n        and Medina), had been built on the southern side of the Temple Mount.\n        Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half\n        centuries. In 1099, under their leaders Godfrey de Bouillon and\n        Tancred, the Crusaders captured the Holy City for Christendom by\n        slaughtering both Muslims and Jews.\n        Crusaders, Mamelukes, and Turks\n        The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with\n        Godfrey at its head. They built many impressive churches during the\n        term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were\n        driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin. During the\n        Sixth Crusade (1228\u2013 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed\n        to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation.\n        The Christians, however, could not hold the city. After\n        they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the\n        Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next\n        250 years. The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and\n        invasions. Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was\n        constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken\n        their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had\n        enjoyed in earlier times.\n        In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was\n        advancing through the Middle East. Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in\n        1517, remaining under their control for 400 years. Suleiman the\n        Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this\n        day. Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed.\n        But when Suleiman died, his empire, including Jerusalem, began a long\n        period of decline. The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th\n        century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the\n        destination of thousands of travelers each year.\n        19th-Century Aspirations\n        At the same time, many Jews sought religious freedom and\n        fulfillment by moving to Palestine (as the Holy Land was traditionally\n        called) and especially to Jerusalem. In the 1890s, Theodor Herzl\n        (1860\u20131904) worked to organize a movement, Zionism, to create a Jewish\n        state. Chaim Weizmann (1874\u20131952), a scientist born in Russia but later\n        a British subject, did much to put Herzl\u2019s hopes into practice.\n        Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British\n        government that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917, supporting the\n        idea of a Jewish \u201cnational home\u201d in Palestine that also respected the\n        rights of existing non-Jewish people already living there. The problem\n        was that British strategists, who were fighting the Ottoman Turks in\n        1917, had secretly promised the lands to their World War I Arab\n        allies.\n        In 1922 the League of Nations granted the British a mandate\n        to administer Palestine. Jerusalem flourished during the early years of\n        the Mandate. Modern neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, and the Hebrew\n        University were built in West Jerusalem, the new Jewish enclave. But\n        Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine\n        led to increasing strife; by 1946, Jerusalem was an armed camp. In 1947\n        the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two\n        states, one Jewish and one Arab, with Jerusalem as an international\n        city that belonged to neither. But lacking the means to enforce its\n        decision, the United Nations was powerless to halt the fighting that\n        erupted as the British withdrew their troops in 1948.\n        Modern Israel\n        The State of Israel was declared during this difficult\n        time. In response, member states of the Arab League sent troops to help\n        the Palestinian Arabs. West Jerusalem, separated from the rest of the\n        new Jewish nation, held out under siege for several months until\n        Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the\n        coastal areas. Jews were evacuated from the Old City\u2019s Jewish Quarter,\n        and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem. As a\n        result of armistice agreements in 1949, Jerusalem was divided: West\n        Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control, and East Jerusalem\n        (including the Old City, with its Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and\n        Armenian quarters) came under Jordanian authority. Free access to holy\n        sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice\n        agreements. However, with the city partitioned by fortifications and\n        barbed wire, no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the\n        Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem.\n        For the next 19 years, Jerusalem was two cities. Political\n        and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of\n        terrorism or sniping until the Six Day War in June 1967. Within three\n        days the city was completely in Israeli hands, and in two weeks it was\n        physically and administratively reunited. Jerusalem\u2019s mayor, Teddy\n        Kollek, spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of\n        development, adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting\n        neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the\n        concerns of Jerusalem\u2019s many communities.\n        Today, as always, Jerusalem is a city of controversies:\n        religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews; Palestinians calling for\n        independence; many residents protesting a wave of high-rise development\n        that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis. But\n        the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily\n        special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present-day\n        Jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world\u2019s attention into the new\n        millennium.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "HistoryJerusalem", "class": "travel-guides"}

The landscape of the valley\n        changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding\n        the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure\n        story of man\u2019s slow and sporadic development.\n        Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a\n        lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in\n        much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one\n        exception\u2002\u2014\u2002the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the\n        surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams\n        draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas\n        surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of\n        grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would\n        eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis.\n        For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that\n        included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more\n        advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when\n        the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the\n        Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as\n        irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to\n        achieve a benchmark of advanced society\u2002\u2014\u2002the ability to live in\n        permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.\n        Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150,\n        leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes, another\n        hunter-gatherer tribe.\n        Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the\n        Anasazi, the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until\n        European settlers arrived, changing the nature of existence in the\n        valley forever.\n        From Mailmen to Mormons\n        In the early nineteenth century, America\u2019s western\n        territories were still largely unexplored. It was not until 1829 that\n        Rafael Rivera, a Mexican scout, found a spring-fed valley and dubbed it\n        Las Vegas\u2002\u2014\u2002a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering\n        exactly where \u201cthe meadows\u201d really lay.\n        For fifteen years, Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail\n        way-station. In 1844, American explorer John C. Fremont parked his\n        horses at Big Springs, and his report to the government resulted in a\n        mail route leading past the spot on its way to California. This put Las\n        Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its\n        history.\n        In 1855, Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising\n        reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley;\n        they eventually built a fort not far from today\u2019s Downtown. Surrounded\n        by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert, the adobe fort became a\n        focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years.\n        The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the\n        desert, trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their\n        circumstances and spread the Mormon faith. Additional pressures from\n        arriving miners pushed the missionaries\u2019 plight beyond recovery. Their\n        supplies scarce, their harvest meager, and their spirit broken, they\n        abandoned the fort in 1858.\n        Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver, by\n        1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors\n        headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold. One\n        opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass. Bestowed with plenty\n        of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this\n        day, Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left\n        off\u2002\u2014\u2002at least when it came to ranching and farming. Gass took over the\n        abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres (260 hectares) surrounding it,\n        dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch. He expanded the ranch and irrigated the\n        land so that it would support crops and cattle. His determination had\n        other results as well: Gass was named a justice of the peace and a\n        territorial legislator.\n        Despite his ambition, Gass\u2019 success was short-lived. In the\n        late 1870s, he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart, so\n        Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own. True to wild-West\n        stereotypes, Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer, leaving his\n        strong-willed wife, Helen, to assume the duties of the ranch. Through\n        1905, Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres (810 hectares),\n        making quite a bit of money in the process.\n        What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las\n        Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across\n        almost all of Western America to this day. The railroad was coming, and\n        when it arrived, Las Vegas would never be the same again.\n        Of Tracks and Tracts\n        At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake\n        City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West.\n        Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail, this was about to\n        change quickly. When it did, the Las Vegas Valley (which at the time\n        had a non-native population of less than 30) would change as well.\n        In 1903, officials of the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt\n        Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas, eager to secure a right-of-way for\n        their Los Angeles\u2013Salt Lake connection. Las Vegas would serve as a\n        major stopover for crew rest and train repair. For all this, the\n        railroad needed land. As mapped, the track traveled directly through\n        Helen Stewart\u2019s Las Vegas Ranch. Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch\n        to the railroad. The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes.\n        In early 1905, the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake\n        City was completed, and train tracks bore right down the center of the\n        Las Vegas Valley. On 15 May 1905, the railroad held a land sale\u2002\u2014\u2002a\n        momentous step in Las Vegas history. Standing at the depot at Main and\n        Fremont streets, railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had\n        subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub. Land speculators\n        and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad\n        boomtown, and within an afternoon, more than 80 percent of the lots\n        were sold.\n        Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement. With\n        rail service in place and forty blocks of private property, it was\n        ready to become a real town. Businesses sprang up overnight, and wooden\n        houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early\n        settlers had lived. One year after the auction, the population of Las\n        Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents, a portent of things to come for\n        the next ninety years.\n        Dam Good Luck\n        From the beginning, Las Vegas was built to serve travelers.\n        The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place. Growth\n        continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones,\n        round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population\u2002\u2014\u2002many of whom\n        worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon\n        come to a halt.\n        The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union\n        Pacific buying the Los Angeles\u2013Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then\n        consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility.\n        Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada\u2019s new Clark\n        County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling.\n        These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the\n        status of a small desert community that could no longer support its\n        3000 residents. But the southwest\u2019s growing need for water, combined\n        with Las Vegas\u2019s fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give\n        Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity.\n        Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam,\n        subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project)\n        began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas.\n        Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover\n        Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both\n        financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also\n        created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to\n        all of southern Nevada.\n        More Government Help\n        The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save\n        Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing\n        gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though\n        legislators and residents could never have known this at the time.\n        The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam\u2019s 1935\n        dedication set the city\u2019s now-formidable public relations machine into\n        action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest\n        citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn\u2019t take long for the\n        city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \u201canything goes\u201d\n        attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal\n        here, available any hour of any day (or night). Thus originated Las\n        Vegas\u2019s reputation as an adult theme park.\n        Additional catalysts for the valley\u2019s growth came from\n        World War II. Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School (which became\n        Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site) in the north, and Basic\n        Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson, arrived in the early 1940s\n        as a result of America\u2019s war effort. By 1945, the population had grown\n        to almost 20,000, with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace.\n        But this was not yet the Las Vegas of folklore.\n        Mobsters and Rat Packers\n        While many gambling halls opened Downtown in the 1930s and\n        early 1940s, only two were built on the stretch of old Los Angeles\n        Highway that ultimately became the Strip. The El Rancho Vegas (1941)\n        was the first, followed by the Last Frontier (1943). During this\n        period, East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin \u201cBugsy\u201d Siegel earned a\n        foothold as a local casino operator.\n        By 1945 Siegel had become one of Las Vegas\u2019s original\n        visionaries, planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the LA\n        Highway. When the Flamingo opened in December 1946, it did so with\n        Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash. But the Mafia bosses who\n        financed the operation were displeased with its performance; Siegel was\n        murdered in the summer of 1947.\n        Despite its initial failings, Siegel\u2019s Flamingo survived\n        him, as did mob infiltration of casinos. In fact, the Flamingo would\n        launch over two decades of strong mob presence in Las Vegas. Freely\n        flowing \u201ccomps\u201d (complimentary food, drink, and entertainment) were the\n        order of the day, with mob bosses content to provide an environment of\n        pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in.\n        While the mob was running the casinos, promoters were\n        busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert. From\n        the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that\n        it was the \u201cEntertainment Capital of the World. \u201d Emerging stars, no\n        longer content with playing small nightclubs, came to Las Vegas with\n        dreams of making it big. Many of them did. Frank Sinatra, Wayne Newton,\n        and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found\n        themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were\n        written. The Rat Pack\u2002\u2014\u2002originally Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy\n        Davis Jr. , Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, all in town to film Ocean\u2019s\n        11\u2002\u2014\u2002landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay. Other\n        Hollywood stars came as well, simply because Las Vegas was the place to\n        be.\n        As a result, more casinos emerged along the Strip. The\n        Thunderbird, Desert Inn, Sahara, Sands, and Riviera hotels were erected\n        during this period, luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of\n        all-night partying, exclusive entertainment, and cheap accommodations.\n        There was no longer any question: when you wanted some unbridled adult\n        fun, Las Vegas was the place to be.\n        New Legitimacy\n        Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in\n        its bid to control Las Vegas\u2002\u2014\u2002corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had\n        developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were\n        made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent\n        ties to illegal activities.\n        That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of\n        billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was\n        nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas\n        ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered\n        himself in the Desert Inn\u2019s penthouse. Several weeks later he was\n        asked\u2002\u2014\u2002then ordered\u2002\u2014\u2002to vacate the room to make room for high\n        rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the\n        management. Thus began Hughes\u2019 legendary three-year, $300-million Las\n        Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an\n        airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching\n        from the Strip to the mountains.\n        Hughes\u2019 actions would have beneficial repercussions, both\n        immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired\n        from Hughes\u2019 investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels\n        bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line\n        in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where\n        illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the\n        formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the\n        beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city.\n        Las Vegas with a Vision\n        As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out,\n        a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its\n        increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became\n        much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of\n        their business.\n        The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas\n        resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began\n        plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several\n        Strip properties\u2002\u2014\u2002the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them\u2002\u2014\u2002and\n        demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort\u2002\u2014\u2002Mirage\u2002\u2014\u2002 which\n        became an instant success.\n        Wynn\u2019s demolition of the existing properties started a\n        trend that, more than any other, describes Las Vegas at the end of the\n        20th century: removal of old properties in exchange for the potential\n        of new ones. This trend has led to many more demolitions, including the\n        Dunes (replaced by Bellagio), Aladdin (the new Aladdin) and Sands\n        (Venetian) hotels.\n        Wynn\u2019s casinos have also set new standards. They can no\n        longer be just a box filled with gaming tables, restaurants, and a\n        showroom. Excalibur, the MGM Grand, the Luxor, and New York-New York\n        all followed Mirage\u2019s lead during the 1990s, offering themed\n        environments and attractions for families.\n        As evidence of the \u201cever-faster\u201d nature of the city, by the\n        middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash, with\n        many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience.\n        The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era: the\n        comprehensive resort. New resorts offer attractions and amenities\n        modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide, including\n        luxurious spas, signature restaurants, and exclusive boutiques.\n        Additionally, a handful of resorts\u2002\u2014\u2002such as the South-Seas\n        themed Mandalay Bay, the Mirage, and the new Four Seasons\u2002\u2014\u2002are now\n        catering exclusively to the luxury travel market. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\n        of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn\u2019s Bellagio. The world\u2019s most\n        expensive resort at $1.6 billion, the Bellagio\u2019s amenities include\n        5-star dining, Chanel-caliber boutiques, and a world-class collection\n        of artistic masterworks. Perhaps more important, such high-end\n        accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the\n        mythology of the Rat Pack era.\n        As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming\n        venue, the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed. Over 20,000 additional\n        hotel rooms have been added in a few short years, including resorts in\n        Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas. Recent business projections for Las Vegas\n        predict challenges; tourism revenues must increase substantially to\n        sustain what is already built, while actual figures show visitation as\n        steady or declining. The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for\n        nearly a century may be facing a roadblock.\n        Still, the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as\n        much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else.\n        With its new look and new aim, the prospects are good despite the\n        warnings. Inevitably, some people will get burned in the process, but\n        others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes.\n        And that, more than anything, is the one constant that characterizes\n        the past, present, and future of Las Vegas.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "HistoryLasVegas", "class": "travel-guides"}

New construction is everywhere,\n        the streets buzz, traffic is increasingly congested, and in the\n        frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in Dublin seems intent on changing\n        places with everyone else. At night the streets are crowded with people\n        bent on having a good time. Prosperity is in the air; the roar of the\n        \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d can clearly be heard.\n        But this is not the whole picture. The proverbial\n        hospitality and warm welcome are still here. This busy, modern European\n        city sits on a thousand years of history\u2002\u2014\u2002history is present\n        everywhere, from elegant Merrion Square to the bullet holes on the\n        General Post Office. It\u2019s also a city of the imagination, reinvented\n        and reappraised in the literature of its exiles. And the old Dublin is\n        with us, too\u2002\u2014\u2002the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar\n        magic possessed by Ireland and the Irish.\n        Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic\n        preservation. Dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor. You\n        can view artifacts from the Bronze Age, trace the history of the Easter\n        Rising, or revisit Leopold Bloom\u2019s odyssey in Ulysses. Old buildings\n        are being recycled; for example, the 17th-century Royal Hospital now\n        holds the Museum of Modern Art. And Dublin, a city large in\n        expectations, is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its\n        sights on foot.\n        City on the Liffey\n        The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center\n        of the city to Dublin Bay. The river forms a natural line between the\n        north and south sections of the city. This geography is important in\n        understanding Dublin. Historically and culturally this north-south\n        distinction has always been significant, and it still is today, with a\n        dose of good-humored rivalry between the two areas. \u201c I never go north\n        of the Liffey,\u201d one man remarked.\n        Farther out, both north and south, are the sweeping curves\n        of the Royal and Grand Canals. The occasional cry of gulls and\n        unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea,\n        and the Wicklow mountains, which hold Dublin closely to the coast, are\n        visible from everywhere.\n        Dublin is an intimate city, physically small but tightly\n        packed, a perfect place for walking. College Green, the home of Trinity\n        College, provides a natural focus just south of the O\u2019Connell Street\n        bridge. O\u2019Connell Street, the city\u2019s grand boulevard, leads north to\n        Parnell Square. To the south and east is St. Stephen\u2019s Green and\n        Georgian Dublin where the national museums are located. Along the\n        Liffey to the west is Temple Bar, center of nightlife and home to many\n        of Dublin\u2019s cutting-edge artists and artistic endeavors. Up the hill\n        from Temple Bar are Dublin Castle and Christ Church Cathedral.\n        It won\u2019t rain on you in Dublin all the time. The climate\n        here can best be described as \u201cchangeable\u201d and yet the sudden shifts\n        from light to dark, sunshine to shower, are part of the city\u2019s magic.\n        Buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light; Dublin\n        under a lowering sky is a different place from Dublin in sunshine.\n        Enjoying Dublin\n        Literature has always flourished in Dublin, the only city\n        to have produced three Nobel Prize winners for literature\u2002\u2014\u2002Yeats,\n        Shaw, and Beckett. Joyce, the high priest of literary Modernism,\n        imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses (you\u2019ll see\n        references to it all over). However, sometimes it seems that the city\n        produced artists of this stature by accident, even against its will.\n        Beckett and Joyce, among others, had to leave their homeland to\n        understand it\u2002\u2014\u2002\u2002and to be understood.\n        Dublin theater is legendary, and no visitor should miss\n        seeing a performance at the Abbey Theatre or Gate Theatre. The city\u2019s\n        impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U2 and Bob\n        Geldof is well known\u2002\u2014\u2002there\u2019s even a self-guided tour of their haunts.\n        Traditional Irish music is also alive and well, especially in the pubs,\n        and there has been a revival of storytelling, poetry reading, and\n        traditional dancing. And in this city, where literature and theater\n        have historically dominated the scene, visual arts are finally coming\n        into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries\n        that display the work of modern Irish artists.\n        The constantly crowded and busy Grafton street is the most\n        visible center for shopping, but there are shops all over that carry an\n        international array of goods as well as the Irish crafts and souvenirs\n        you expect. And while multinational chains have made inroads, they seem\n        less blatant here than elsewhere. Many shops, and also hotels and guest\n        houses, have been owned and managed by the same families for years, and\n        theirs is the welcome of traditional Dublin hospitality.\n        Dublin\u2019s food has undergone a metamorphosis. There was a\n        time when you might have apologized for it, but no longer. Dublin has\n        international restaurants galore, and the New Irish Cuisine is built\n        upon fresh products of Ireland\u2019s seas, rivers, and farms. Coffee has\n        replaced the ubiquitous tea\u2002\u2014\u2002Dublin is now almost as much a coffee\n        city as Vienna or Seattle.\n        City and Countryside\n        In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising\n        that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation. Phoenix\n        Park in the northwest is the largest open space, but squares like St.\n        Stephen\u2019s Green are the garden oases of the city.\n        On the coast, Sandymount, Dollymount, and Killiney strands\n        are the places to go. The beautiful Wicklow Mountains, and the Wicklow\n        Mountains National Park provide a more rugged countryside, and the area\n        has breathtaking houses and gardens such as Castletown, Mount Usher,\n        and Powerscourt. To the north and west are the ancient sites of\n        Ireland: Malahide Castle, the evocative hill of Tara, and the long\n        barrows of Knowth and Newgrange.\n        The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) runs north and south\n        along the coast. It\u2019s an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying\n        sights and villages. There are many guided bus tours to sights outside\n        the city, and some are accessible by city bus.\n        Young at Heart?\n        Dublin is a young city. Almost half of Ireland\u2019s population\n        is under twenty-five, and with its universities and professional\n        schools, Dublin also has a large student population. The universities\n        attract students from all over the world, and this influx helps to make\n        Dublin a busy, buzzing international city. However, young and old,\n        stranger and Dubliner rub shoulders quite happily. Religion and respect\n        for parents has not yet gone out of fashion. And young graduates are\n        not leaving now\u2002\u2014\u2002multinational corporations and European Union\n        investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home.\n        Unemployment is at an all-time low. The Irish are actually beginning to\n        come home.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "IntroDublin", "class": "travel-guides"}

With its vibrant atmosphere and\n        night-and-day activity it is an intoxicating place. Hong Kong is\n        crowded\u2002\u2014\u2002it has one of the world\u2019s greatest population densities. But\n        it is also efficient, with one of the best transportation systems\n        anywhere, and for such a crowded place, quiet\u2002\u2014\u2002you don\u2019t hear voices\n        raised in anger, motorists sitting on their horns, or loud boomboxes.\n        Shopping never ends\u2002\u2014\u2002there\u2019s always another inviting spot just down\n        the street. You\u2019ll find Hong Kong easy to get around, the people\n        helpful, English spoken everywhere, and food that lives up to its\n        reputation.\n        On 1 July, 1997 the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong\n        reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of\n        the People\u2019s Republic of China. Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist\n        enclave with its laws and rights intact, and China has promised that\n        Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years.\n        Beijing\u2019s announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and\n        stability makes sense. Hong Kong has long been China\u2019s handiest window\n        on the West, and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know-how and\n        managerial expertise. Around the time of the transition there was much\n        speculation about how things would change. But in fact, once news of\n        the handover vanished from the front pages, the people of Hong Kong\n        returned to their usual topics of conversation: the economy and the\n        price of housing.\n        The impression of the visitor today will be that very little\n        has changed. Establishments are no longer called \u201cRoyal,\u201d Queen\n        Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage, and the Union Jack has been\n        replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its\n        bauhinia flower. But in fact, there have been changes, many of them due\n        to economic progress, new construction, and other factors that\n        influence cities all over the world.\n        Others are more subtle. British social customs are still\n        evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long\n        lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour. The British population\n        has decreased; today there are as many American and Australian ex-pats\n        as there are British.\n        With a population of nearly eight million and a total area\n        of just over 1,095 square km (423 square miles), housing is one of Hong\n        Kong\u2019s perennial nightmares. To alleviate the problem, the government\n        has become the city\u2019s major landlord with the construction of massive\n        apartment blocks that, though they have every modern facility, average\n        only 9 square m (100 square ft) in size. Whole cities have been created\n        in the New Territories, although the unimaginative architecture of\n        these towns has been criticized.\n        Of Hong Kong\u2019s population, 98 percent are Chinese. The\n        majority are Cantonese, born in Hong Kong, or from South China, but\n        there are immigrants from all over China. The Chinese people have been\n        described as hardworking and pragmatic, attitudes that have contributed\n        to Hong Kong\u2019s success. There are many stories of refugees who arrived\n        with nothing in their pockets, set up a small sidewalk stall, worked\n        diligently until they had their own store, and then expanded it into a\n        modest chain.\n        Old customs are still followed: Fate and luck are taken very\n        seriously, and astrologers and fortune-tellers do a steady business.\n        Before a skyscraper can be built, a feng shui (see page 68)\n        investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building\n        will promote health, harmony, and prosperity. You\u2019ll also notice that\n        gambling is a passion, whether it be cards, mah-jong, the lottery, or\n        the horses. Hong Kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive\n        off-track betting system, and on weekends the ferries to Macau are\n        crowded with people on their way to the casinos.\n        Sightseeing in Hong Kong starts at sea level with the\n        enthralling water traffic\u2002\u2014\u2002a mix of freighters, ferries, tugs, junks,\n        and yachts. Views of the city and the harbor are panoramic. From\n        Victoria Peak, Hong Kong\u2019s highest point, or from skyscrapers and\n        hotels, they are especially exciting at night when the lights are\n        on.\n        The business and financial center and the signature soaring\n        architecture are on Hong Kong Island. Across Victoria Harbor, connected\n        by ferry and the MTR rail line, is the Kowloon peninsula with its\n        hotels, nightlife, and almost non-stop shopping. Beyond, in the New\n        Territories, are a mixture of high-rise suburban towns, ancient sites\n        and walled villages, country parks, and farms with ducks and fish\n        ponds. Hong Kong\u2019s other, less developed islands, Lantau, Lamma, and\n        Cheung Chau, provide getaways. You can also take a ferry to Macau to\n        find an entirely different kind of city, a unique blend of Chinese and\n        Iberian culture.\n        It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what may happen in the future, but for\n        now Hong Kong bristles with energy and ambition, and for the visitor,\n        this beautiful city with its contrasts and variety is an exhilarating\n        experience.\n      \n    \n  \n", "mode": "written", "name": "IntroHongKong", "class": "travel-guides"}

While it\u2019s no\n        longer the bargain shopping destination it once was, there are still\n        some good buys to be had. Since Hong Kong is a duty-free port and\n        charges no sales tax, goods are cheaper here than in the country where\n        they were made. On photographic equipment, electronic goods, and\n        watches, you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home country.\n        Specialty goods and souvenirs, often handmade, come from Hong Kong and\n        elsewhere in China. Custom-made garments by skillful Hong Kong tailors\n        are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable\n        garments. Note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to Hong\n        Kong\u2019s duty-free regime and are subject to tax.\n        You\u2019ll find that prices are about the same in Hong Kong\n        Central and Kowloon, and somewhat cheaper in Causeway Bay, which caters\n        to local shopping. Large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to\n        be more expensive than smaller \u201cfamily\u201d shops tucked away in the side\n        streets.\n        Stores do not open until 10am or later, but shopping goes on\n        into the evening, up to 9:30pm. Most shops are open seven days a week.\n        Shops in Central are an exception; they generally close at 6pm and are\n        not open on Sunday. The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a\n        halt is the Chinese New Year in January or February.\n        Buyer Beware. Be aware that name brands, including\n        electronics, are sometimes fakes, glass may be sold as jade, and that\n        antique you bought may have been made last night. Always ask for a\n        receipt that records information about the item, and if you buy an\n        antique, be sure to get a certificate of authentication. Needless to\n        say, avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take\n        you to wondrous bargains.\n        The large department stores have fixed prices, but elsewhere\n        you should ask whether there is a discount, especially if you buy\n        several items in one shop.

Always ask to see the manufacturer\u2019s guarantee when\n        purchasing watches, cameras, and audio-visual and electronic\n        equipment.\n        Note that when haggling, the merchant assumes you are\n        prepared to pay cash.

Many stores will pack and ship purchases. Ask if\n        automatic free insurance is provided.

As the\n        double-decker boats get ready to leave the pier, bells ring, the\n        gangplank is raised, deckhands in blue sailor suits man the hawsers,\n        and a couple of hundred commuters begin a seven-minute sightseeing\n        tour. The big green-and-white boat weaves its way through an\n        ever-changing obstacle course of both large and small craft, and the\n        soaring skyline of Hong Kong Island draws nearer.\n        As you get off, the 52-story Jardine House with\n        porthole-shaped windows catches the eye. There are restaurants and a\n        Starbuck\u2019s in the basement, and you can access the raised pedestrian\n        crosswalk from the escalators on the ground floor. Next to the Jardine\n        building is Exchange Square, a complex with a large shopping mall; just\n        behind it is the General Post Office with a philatelic center on the\n        ground floor.\n        Farther west is the ferry terminal for the outlying islands.\n        On Connaught Road Central, you\u2019ll find one of Hong Kong\u2019s curiosities,\n        the 244-m- (800-ft-) long Mid-Levels outdoor escalator. It ferries\n        commuters from the Mid-Levels apartment complexes downhill from 6 to\n        10am, and uphill from 10am to midnight. Nearby is Central Market, the\n        wholesale food market of Hong Kong, and the Hang Seng building (private\n        offices).\n        Just east of the Star Ferry terminal, you\u2019ll come to City\n        Hall. No longer a center of government, it now functions as a cultural\n        center. Go through the underground walkway to Statue Square; on the\n        east side of the square is the Legislative Council Building, one of the\n        few colonial buildings left in Hong Kong. So great is the pressure on\n        the available land that most of Hong Kong\u2019s colonial architectural\n        heritage has been demolished and replaced by new skyscrapers. Despite\n        protests by preservationists, there was little alternative.\n        Nearby is Chater Garden and a number of notable\n        architectural landmarks. Most famous is the striking 74-story I.M. Pei\n        Bank of China Tower, not beloved by the people of Hong Kong\u2002\u2014\u2002its\n        triangular prisms and sharp angles violate the principles of feng shui\n        (see box, page 68) and its radio masts stick up like an insect\u2019s\n        antennae. The rival Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank is by architect Norman\n        Foster; built on a \u201ccoathanger frame,\u201d its floors hang rather than\n        ascend. From inside the vast atrium you can view the whole structure as\n        well as the mechanical workings of the building. Two bronze lions,\n        carrying out feng shui principles, guard its doors.\n        You can catch one of Hong Kong\u2019s historic trams along Des\n        Voeux Road and ride from Central to Causeway Bay (see box, page 66). In\n        1904, the narrow, double-decker trams ran along the waterfront, but\n        land reclamation has placed them far inland.\n        From the Bank of China Tower, make a short detour up Garden\n        Road and turn into Battery Path to reach the landmark St. John\u2019s\n        Cathe\u00addral. Built 1847\u20131849, this usually deserted Anglican foundation\n        is Hong Kong\u2019s oldest church. During World War II, the church was\n        turned into a club for Japanese officers; it was restored after the\n        war. Note the stained glass windows in the Quiet Chapel, designed by\n        Joseph Edward Nuttgens in the late 1950s. Behind the church is the 1917\n        French Mission Building, now used as the Court of Final Appeal.\n        Across from the I.M. Pei tower a winding path leads up to\n        Hong Kong Park. The park\u2019s 10.5 hectares (25 acres) of landscaped\n        gardens and lakes contains a large greenhouse that holds many species\n        of plants, and an aviary of exotic birds. In the park is the Flagstaff\n        House Museum of Tea Ware (see page 54). It\u2019s in Hong Kong\u2019s oldest\n        colonial building, with exhibits describing the history of tea from the\n        Warring States period (475\u2013221 b.c. ) to the present.\n        If you leave the park and walk up Cotton Tree Drive, you\n        will find the Peak Tram terminal.\n        To the Summit\n        For more than a century, the most exhilarating way up\n        Victoria Peak has been by funicular. The Peak Tram starts its scenic\n        climb just across the street and around the corner from the American\n        Consulate in Garden Road and makes its way, sometimes at a startlingly\n        steep incline, to the summit at 398 m (1,305 ft). The right-of-way\n        travels past fancy apartment blocks, bamboo stands, and jungle flowers.\n        Passengers crane their necks for dizzying glimpses of the harbor. The\n        Peak is still the most fashionable place to live in Hong Kong, but real\n        estate prices here are astronomical; rents run around HK$50,000 a\n        month.\n        The Peak Tram, originally steam-powered, was built to speed\n        the wealthy taipans to their mountainside retreats. Before the tram was\n        built, sedan chairs and rickshaws were the only way to get here. Since\n        the tram\u2019s inauguration in 1888 it has stopped only for typhoons and\n        World War II.\n        The modern 120-passenger cars make the journey in around\n        eight minutes. However, on sunny Saturdays and Sundays you may have to\n        brave a crowd lining up at the lower terminal. During the spring and\n        autumn festivals, when people traditionally seek out the hilltops, the\n        throngs are so large you would be better advised to try another\n        time.\n        At the upper terminus there is a four-level shopping\n        center, the Peak Galleria, and the Peak Tower, which resembles an\n        airport control tower and has shops, entertainment, and\n        restaurants.\n        You can walk around the peak for impressive views of Hong\n        Kong, the coastline, and the islands in 45 minutes on Lugard and\n        Harlech roads. The view is especially effective at night. There are\n        also souvenir stands, benches for a rest, and perhaps Hong Kong\u2019s last\n        surviving rickshaws\u2002\u2014\u2002however these are not for rides, but are a\n        tourist photo opportunity. If you\u2019re up to a climb, take the Mount\n        Austin road to the Victoria Peak Gardens. These gardens used to belong\n        to the governor\u2019s mountain lodge, but the building was demolished by\n        the Japanese during the occupation of Hong Kong.\n        From the lower terminal of the Peak Tram it\u2019s only a short\n        walk to the former governor\u2019s residence, Government House, now a\n        museum. Across from the mansion, the Zoological and Botanical Gardens\n        (gardens open daily 6am\u201310pm; zoo 6am\u20137pm; admission free) provide a\n        welcome oasis amid the big-city pressures. In the very early morning\n        the park is taken over by people doing tai-chi exercises. Both young\n        and old go through ballet-like movements in slow motion to discipline\n        the mind and body. The park\u2019s zoo has a collection of weird and\n        wonderful chattering jungle birds.\n        More Hong Kong Island Sights\n        Western District\n        The Western District is one of Hong Kong\u2019s oldest\n        neighborhoods, and its narrow streets hold a collection of fascinating\n        traditional shops and enterprises. Opposite the Macau Ferry Terminal\n        you\u2019ll find the Western Market (open 10am\u20137pm). It is more interesting\n        for its architecture than for its shopping; it\u2019s situated in a\n        four-story Edwardian building built in 1906. For an interesting glimpse\n        of small and family-owned shops, walk along Bonham Strand East and\n        West, Man Wa Lane, and Cleverly Street. You\u2019ll find herb and medicine\n        shops, incense shops, chop makers\u2019 shops (makers of Chinese seals), and\n        more.\n        Hong Kong University\u2019s campus is spread along Bonham Road.\n        When it opened in 1912, the university had a total of 72 students. At\n        the top of a sloping driveway, the stately Edwardian structure that was\n        the original university building presides over the institution\u2019s newer\n        buildings. The University\u2019s Fung Ping Shan Museum, 94 Bonham Road (open\n        Monday\u2013Saturday 9:30am\u20136pm, admission free) holds a significant\n        collection of antiquities: bronzes, dating from 3000 b.c. , and\n        ceramics, including Han Dynasty tomb pottery. It also has the world\u2019s\n        largest collection of Nestorian crosses from the Yuan Dynasty\n        period.\n        Around Hollywood Road\n        Take the Mid-Levels Escalator to Hollywood road, known for\n        its antiques and curio shopping. Here the windows and open doors of the\n        shops reveal an alluring selection of Asian furniture, carpets,\n        carvings, tomb figures, porcelain, and bronze.\n        Walk west along Hollywood Road until you come to Man Mo\n        Temple, the island\u2019s oldest house of worship (though the date of its\n        founding is subject to dispute). Visitors entering the temple are\n        confronted by a dense pall of smoke from all the burning joss sticks\n        and the incense coils hanging from the ceiling (these will burn for as\n        long as a month). The gold-plated sedan chairs on the left-hand side of\n        the temple were once used for transporting the statues of the temple\u2019s\n        gods in religious processions. The statues in the main shrine represent\n        Man, the god of literature, and Mo, the god of war, a curious\n        juxtaposition. The temple is always crowded with worshipers.\n        Just past the temple is the aptly named Ladder Street. Go\n        down one flight of steps to Lascar Row, popularly known as Cat Street,\n        for more antiques and curio shops. Walk up the steps to reach Caine\n        Lane, where you\u2019ll find the Museum of Medical Sciences (open\n        Tuesday\u2013Saturday 10am\u20135pm; admission by donation). The interesting\n        Edwardian building was formerly the Pathological Institute, founded to\n        combat the 19th century\u2019s 30-year-long outbreak of bubonic plague. The\n        old laboratory is still intact, and there are exhibits on Chinese\n        pharmacology and the history of medicine in Hong Kong.\n        Wan Chai\n        Just to the east of the financial district, Wan Chai was\n        once an area of sleazy clubs and topless bars; this was the setting for\n        The World of Suzy Wong. Servicemen relaxing from the rigors of the\n        Vietnam War poured millions of dollars into the Wan Chai boom of the\n        1960s. There are still bars and clubs here, but the area has become\n        almost mainstream, and office towers are replacing many of the sinful\n        old premises.\n        The Wan Chai waterfront is dominated by the Hong Kong\n        Convention and Exhibition Centre, the largest in Asia, which includes\n        hotels, theaters, and exhibition halls. The convention center, an\n        extension on reclaimed land, affords stunning views of the Wan Chai\n        waterfront. Adjacent, just west of the convention center, is another\n        modern highlight, the Academy for the Performing Arts on Gloucester\n        Road.\n        On Wan Chai\u2019s Bowen Road, Maiden\u2019s Rock, also called\n        Lover\u2019s Rock, is the gathering place for the annual Maiden\u2019s festival.\n        Although it is not a tourist attraction, the rock is steeped in\n        tradition. Every August young women convene to light joss sticks and\n        some even climb the nine-meter (30-ft) rock to pray for good\n        husbands.\n        Causeway Bay\n        About 2 km (a mile) east of Wan Chai, Causeway Bay is\n        second only to Tsim Sha Tsui as Hong Kong\u2019s place to shop. A prosperous\n        tourist district, it is full of shopping centers and department stores,\n        along with a number of good restaurants. The busy night-and-day crowds\n        make this area vibrant and lively.\n        On the nautical side is the Causeway Bay typhoon shelter,\n        where expensive yachts are anchored almost gunwale to gunwale, and the\n        Hong Kong Yacht Club has its headquarters. Across Gloucester Road,\n        opposite the World Trade Centre, is the Noonday Gun, which under\n        British rule was sounded on the stroke of midday. Silent for a time,\n        the tradition has been revived and is a tourist attraction. It\u2019s not\n        clear how the custom started. One story has it that traders Jardine,\n        Matheson & Co fired a private salute for a visiting tycoon, an act\n        that incensed the colonial authorities, who felt that they had the sole\n        right to issue such a 21-gun welcome. As a result, the merchants were\n        forced to limit their salvoes to one a day\u2002\u2014\u2002and from then on, they\n        signaled the noon hour daily for all to hear. The gun was made famous\n        by Noel Coward\u2019s satirical song, \u201cMad Dogs and Englishmen. \u201d\n        Farther east is Hong Kong\u2019s largest park, Victoria Park,\n        with sports grounds and other facilities. On the eastern side of\n        Victoria Park on Causeway Road is Tin Hau Temple, dedicated to Tin Hau,\n        the Taoist Queen of Heaven and patroness of seafarers. Originally the\n        temple was on the shore but reclamation projects have now left it high\n        and dry. On the 23rd day of the Third Moon, the birthday of the goddess\n        is celebrated here and in all Hong Kong fishing communities.\n        Inland from the bay is Happy Valley. At one time it was a\n        very miserable valley, a swampland conducive only to breeding malarial\n        mosquitoes. It is home to Hong Kong\u2019s first racetrack. Hong Kong\u2019s\n        gamblers are so eager to play the horses that, despite the opening of a\n        bigger and better racetrack at Sha Tin, the Happy Valley Racecourse is\n        thriving.\n        Up Tai Hang Road behind Causeway Bay is Aw Boon Haw (Tiger\n        Balm) Gardens (open daily 9:30am\u20134pm), founded in 1935 by the late Aw\n        Boon Haw, who became a millionaire by producing the medicinal Tiger\n        Balm. (It does not, in fact, contain any ingredients from tigers, but\n        does promise to cure a wide range of problems such as colds, headaches,\n        rheumatism, gout, toothache, and scorpion bites. ) With its garish\n        pagodas, artificial caves, and brightly painted statues of well-known\n        Taoist and Buddhist legends, the garden is an obvious photo\n        opportunity.\n        around the Coast\n        Aberdeen, the island\u2019s oldest settlement, once a pirate\n        lair, is home to the \u201cfloating population\u201d\u2002\u2014 the boat people who spend\n        their entire lives on the junks in the harbor, some proudly claiming\n        never to have set foot on land (except for funerals, which don\u2019t\n        count). The junks are a picturesque sight: children frolicking on the\n        poop deck, women preparing food or playing mah-jong, elderly folk\n        watching the sunset, dogs and cats underfoot, songbirds in bamboo cages\n        overhead\u2002\u2014\u2002and all afloat.\n        The boats may appear deceptively primitive, but many of\n        them have their own electric generators and all the modern\n        conveniences. There are fewer boats now than in the past; many boat\n        people, especially the younger generation, have moved to housing\n        projects. You can take a tour of the port in one of the small sampans,\n        propelled by hand by women drivers. A half-hour tour costs HK$50; pay\n        at the end, or the driver may cut your trip short.\n        Aberdeen\u2019s theatrical floating restaurants have been a\n        tourist attraction for many years. The food may not live up to\n        expectations, but the fantasy environment makes up for it. If you can\n        get up early enough, you can attend the pre-dawn auction held at the\n        vast local wholesale fish market; otherwise, have a look at the street\n        market that goes on later in the day.\n        The peninsula opposite the east coast of Ap Lei Chau island\n        contains Ocean Park (open daily 10am\u20136pm; admission HK$150 adults,\n        HK$75 children), which has become one of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest\n        attractions. It is divided into three areas: a highland, a lowland, and\n        the Middle Kingdom. Linking the lowland and highland sections of the\n        park, a cable-car system offers spectacular views across to the islands\n        of the South China Sea.\n        The Oceanarium is said to be the largest in the world, and\n        the Ocean Theatre features displays by dolphins, killer whales, seals,\n        and pelicans. An enormous roller-coaster rising way above the sea,\n        space wheels, and high-diving shows guarantee a day of excitement. The\n        Middle Kingdom is a recreated \u201cliving\u201d history of China\u2019s past,\n        presented through a number of full-size replicas of shrines, temples,\n        pagodas, palaces, and street scenes. There are also demonstrations of\n        traditional Chinese crafts, including silk-weaving, pottery, and p\n        apermaking. Water World, formerly in the complex, has closed for\n        redevelopment.\n        Continuing around the coast in a counter-clockwise\n        direction, Deep Water Bay offers a good beach and harbors. The next\n        inlet is Repulse Bay, a roomy, sandy crescent, with green hills. It\u2019s\n        so attractive and so easy to reach that it\u2019s packed with sunbathers all\n        summer long.\n        Stanley was once one of the main fishing villages on Hong\n        Kong Island. The well-known Stanley Mar\u00adket (see page 55) is a major\n        source for bargain clothing and other merchandise. Stanley is also a\n        favorite place of residence for ex-pats. The waterfronts at Repulse Bay\n        and Stanley are lined with good caf\u00e9s and restaurants.\n        Kowloon\n        Though much smaller than Hong Kong Island, Kowloon has\n        almost twice the population. In many areas, the density reaches the\n        equivalent of 150,000 inhabitants per square km (a quarter square\n        mile).\n        Most of Kowloon\u2019s attractions for visitors are centered\n        near the tip of the peninsula in the district known as Tsim Sha Tsui.\n        Adjacent to the Star Ferry terminal is Ocean Terminal, where\n        international cruise ships dock, and the gigantic Harbour City, a\n        complex of malls, hotels, and restaurants.\n        If you walk east on the Star Ferry terminal concourse, you\n        will find yourself on the wonderful Promenade, which begins at the\n        clock tower, all that remains of the once grand Kowloon-Canton Railway\n        Terminus. The waterfront here offers unparalled views of the harbor and\n        Hong Kong Island. If you continue to the end of the promenade, you will\n        be in Tsim Sha Tsui East, a busy commercial district built on more than\n        60 hectares (150 acres) of reclaimed land.\n        Flanked by the clock tower is the imposing Hong Kong\n        Cultural Centre. Hong Kong\u2019s major venue for the performing arts, the\n        building has been criticized for its fortress-like architecture and\n        windowless fa\u00e7ade. The interior is a comfortable amalgam of Chinese and\n        Western design, with an impressive main lobby. The center contains a\n        concert hall with acclaimed acoustics, theaters, a library, an\n        exhibition gallery, shops, restaurants, and bars.\n        Next door is the Hong Kong Space Museum and Theatre (open\n        Monday, Wed\u00adnesday\u2013Friday 1\u20139pm; Sat\u00adur\u00adday, Sunday 10am\u20139pm; closed\n        Tuesday; admission HK$10 adults, HK$5 children; separate admission to\n        theater). Its futuristic dome design is striking; inside are\n        interactive exhibits, including one in which you can experience\n        weightlessness. The theater presents \u201csky shows\u201d and IMAX films. The\n        Hong Kong Museum of Art (see page 54) stands behind the Space Museum\n        next to the cultural center. It contains the Xubaizhi collection of\n        painting and calligraphy; galleries devoted to antiquities and\n        ceramics; and a gallery of modern Chinese art. Particularly interesting\n        is the collection of paintings and photographs of old Hong Kong. The\n        museum mounts special exhibitions and has an excellent gift shop.\n        A few blocks up Chatham Road South are two more major\n        museums. The Scien\u00adce Mus\u00adeum (see page 55) is a state-of-the-art\n        interactive museum that will teach you how everything and anything\n        works from ancient sailing ships to the latest technology. The Museum\n        of History (open Tuesday\u2013Saturday 10am\u20136pm, Sunday 1\u20136pm; closed\n        Monday; admission HK$10 adult, HK$5 child) opened its new permanent\n        collection at the end of August 2001. The fascinating collection of\n        artifacts pertaining showcases 6,000 years of Hong Kong\u2019s history and\n        Chinese culture.\n        Just across Salisbury Road from the cultural center is the\n        historic Peninsula Hotel, now expanded and modernized by a 32-story\n        tower. Its restored lobby is Hong Kong\u2019s most elegant gathering place;\n        afternoon tea here is a visitors\u2019 ritual.\n        Alongside the hotel runs busy Nathan Road, Hong Kong\u2019s\n        fabled shopping street, lined with shops, hotels, and restaurants.\n        Kowloon\u2019s main street was created by Sir Matthew Nathan when he was\n        governor of Hong Kong at the turn of the 19th century. At the time it\n        was built, many thought it absurd to have a tree-lined boulevard\n        running through what was practically a wilderness. Now the former\n        \u201cNathan\u2019s Folly\u201d is known as the \u201cGolden Mile. \u201d\n        A few blocks up Nathan Road is Kowloon Park (open daily\n        6am\u2013midnight), elegantly laid out with fountains, promenades, and\n        ornamental gardens; be sure to go up the steps to see the Sculpture\n        Walk.\n        Farther up Nathan Street you will reach Yau Ma Tei, one of\n        the older parts of Kowloon. Turn off Nathan and walk down Kansu Street\n        to find the Jade Market (open 10am\u20133pm; see page 80), with more than\n        100 stalls spread out in a large tent, just before you reach the\n        overpass.\n        Hong Kong\u2019s liveliest market scene is the Temple Street\n        Night Market (see page 55), near Jordan Road. Everything is sold here,\n        from clothing to souvenirs to electronic goods, and the market is known\n        for its street-side food stalls, where you can dine inexpensively on\n        seafood. The market runs all the way up to Tin Hau Temple, where you\n        will find fortune tellers\u2019 tables (some speak English) and possibly\n        street performers singing Chinese opera or pop songs. The temple is one\n        of the many dedicated to Tin Hau, goddess of seafarers; this one also\n        houses an altar to Shing Wong, the city\u2019s god. In the daytime the\n        temple (open 8am\u20136pm) attracts worshipers, and its park attracts\n        strollers and mah-jong players.\n        Nathan Road goes all the way up to Boundary Street, which\n        marks the boundary between Kowloon and the New Territories. Near\n        Boundary Street, off Prince Edward Street West, is the Yuen Po Street\n        Bird Garden (open 8am\u20137pm). Birds are favorite pets in Hong Kong,\n        valued for their singing rather than their plumage, and here you\u2019ll\n        find all kinds of birds for sale as well as elaborate teak and bamboo\n        cages.\n        Off the beaten path in Sham Shui Po, west of the junction\n        of Nathan Road and Boundary Street, is the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb and\n        Museum on Tonkin Road (open Monday\u2013Wednesday and Friday\u2013Saturday\n        10am\u20136pm, Sunday 1\u20136pm; closed Thursday). This ancient burial vault is\n        believed to date back to the Han Dynasty (a.d. 25\u2013220). The\n        barrel-vaulted chambers were discovered while excavating for a nearby\n        housing project.\n        New Territories\n        Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories begin at Boundary Street.\n        Surprises spring up on all sides: new industrial complexes alongside\n        sleepy farming villages, skyscraper towns blooming in the middle of\n        nowhere, Hakka women in their traditional flat straw hats with hanging\n        black curtains, water buffalo, and flashes of azalea everywhere.\n        The New Territories can be explored by taking the\n        Kowloon\u2013Canton Railway (KCR), which makes 10 stops between the station\n        in Kowloon and Sheung Shui, the last stop before entering China. Ask\n        the tourist authority about its interesting Heritage Tour from Kowloon\n        and other countryside tours (see page 113).\n        The main highway makes a circuit of the New Territories,\n        beginning with the new town of Tsuen Wan, situated in an area of heavy\n        industry just west of Kowloon. North of the town, a commanding view\n        over all the New Territories to the north can be seen from Tai Mo Shan,\n        Hong Kong\u2019s highest peak at 957 m (3,140 ft). The highway continues\n        parallel to the coast. One-third of all Hong Kong\u2019s beaches are to be\n        found in a single 14-km (9-mile) stretch of this region\u2019s shoreline.\n        Place names are often based on the distance to the nearest mile-post,\n        as measured from the tip of the Kowloon peninsula. Thus you will find\n        \u201c191/2-mile Beach\u201d at Castle Peak Bay.\n        The main road continues clockwise around the New\n        Territories. As you approach the border, you can glimpse the\n        skyscrapers of Shenzhen. The lookout point at Lok Ma Chau was once\n        known as Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cwindow on China\u201d\u2002\u2014\u2002in the years of China\u2019s\n        isolation from the West, tourists would come to the lookout point here\n        and rent binoculars in order to get a glimpse of the great mystery\n        beyond.\n        Set amid Tseun Wan\u2019s residential towers is the 18th-century\n        walled village of Sam Tung Uk, now preserved as a museum, and a short\n        walk from the MTR station. Not far away, at milepost 21 near the large\n        new town of Tuen Mun, is a Taoist retreat known as Ching Chung Koon.\n        This \u201cTemple of Green Pines\u201d is a spacious complex containing temples\n        and pavilions, statues, and gardens. It is known for its collection of\n        bonsai and houses a jade seal more than 1,000 years old. Among the\n        ponds is one inhabited by turtles: Visitors toss in coins in the hope\n        of bouncing one off a turtle\u2019s head, a sure way of achieving good\n        fortune.\n        An even more interesting image out of Chinese history is\n        the walled village of Kat Hing Wai, in the village of Kam Tin just\n        outside the market town of Yuen Long. This is the most easily\n        accessible of the New Territories\u2019 walled villages. It is built in a\n        square, and the only way in is through the gate in the brick defensive\n        wall. Kat Hing Wai was built four or five centuries ago by the Hakka\n        Tang clan, one of the Five Great Clans that migrated here from North\n        China (see page 11). Many of the old houses in the village have been\n        replaced by modern structures.\n        The Tang clan\u2019s earliest walled village was Lo Wai, which\n        also has its defensive wall intact and is entered by a narrow gate.\n        Adjacent to the village is the restored Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall.\n        Few traditional ancestral halls remain in China since the\n        anti-historical destruction during the Cultural Revolution, so these\n        New Territories ancestral halls are rare survivors. Another such hall,\n        belonging to the Liu Clan, is Liu Man Shek Tong in the village of\n        Sheung Shui.\n        One of the most interesting sites in the New Territories is\n        Tai Fu Tai, another rare survivor, this one a mansion that belonged to\n        a Confucian high official. The house was built in 1865 by a member of\n        the Man clan who achieved the rank of tai fu (mandarin) by doing well\n        in the Imperial Exam\u00adinations. The preservation of this wonderful home\n        is ongoing; a projected restoration of the original garden is still in\n        progress. The traditional Qing Dyna\u00adsty style of the mansion is\n        enlivened by a few West\u00adern touches: a Baroque-style ceiling and\n        stained glass above the doorways, showing the builder\u2019s up-to-date\n        attitude at the time of construction.\n        The highway and the railway stay close together from\n        Fanling, site of the best golf courses in the area. Tai Po, just south\n        of Fanling, is known for its market, Tai Po Market, which buzzes with\n        activity daily from 7am to 6pm. Just up a lane from the market is the\n        Man Mo Temple, with long-burning incense coils hanging from its\n        ceiling, a popular spot dedicated to the Taoist gods of war and\n        literature.\n        The railway line then curves gracefully around Tolo Harbor,\n        an idyllic body of water well-protected from the open sea. You can take\n        a ferryboat through the harbor, past the ingenious Plover Cove\n        reservoir, a water catchment area appropriated by damming and draining\n        a broad inlet from the sea. The boats go on to the friendly fishermen\u2019s\n        island of Tap Mun, in Mirs Bay, with stops in remote hamlets of the Sai\n        Kung Peninsula. The Sai Kung area is the location of two official parks\n        and nature preserves, while on the south side of the peninsula are some\n        of the territory\u2019s best beaches.\n        From the next railway station, the modern campus of the\n        Chinese University of Hong Kong is visible. Teaching here is conducted\n        in both Chinese and English. The Art Gallery in the Institute of\n        Chinese Studies Building is worth a visit for its painting and\n        calligraphy collections.\n        Sha Tin is the site of the Monastery of 10,000 Buddhas,\n        which looks down on a burgeoning town. There are hundreds of stone\n        steps in the hillside to walk up before you reach Man Fat Temple with\n        its regiments of small gilt statues of Buddha lining the walls. Some\n        indefatigable climbers will want to go up to the top of the nine-story\n        pink pagoda for a panoramic view. There is a total of 12,800 Buddha\n        statues here, plus the remains of the monastery\u2019s founder embalmed in\n        gold leaf. Also here is the Hongkong Heritage Museum (call Tel. 2180\n        8188 for open hours). The museum has an art collection, and displays of\n        toys and other artifacts.\n        Down to earth, the Sha Tin Racecourse can accommodate over\n        80,000 spectators and is equipped with every imaginable luxury,\n        including a giant video screen facing the stands, and for the horses,\n        air-conditioned stables. Opposite the Sha Tin railway station, New Town\n        Plaza features shops, cinemas, and even a computer-controlled musical\n        fountain.\n        Two natural rock formations are always pointed out on\n        excursions. Sha Tin Rock, better known as Amah Rock, is actually a pile\n        of several rocks that resemble a woman with a baby in a sling on her\n        back. Legend has it that a local woman climbed the hill every day to\n        watch for her husband returning from across the sea; one day the wife\n        and her child were turned to stone as a permanent symbol of her\n        enduring faith. Closer to town is Lion Rock, shaped like a lion lying\n        in wait. It really looks the part; the tourists know its name even\n        before the guide can translate it.\n        The Islands\n        Excursion companies sell a variety of orientation cruises\n        of Hong Kong harbor that include a look at some of its 235 outlying\n        islands. These pleasant, but expensive, outings can lay the foundation\n        for your own explorations aboard the cheap but usually comfortable\n        ferries used by the islanders themselves. From the ferry terminals on\n        Hong Kong Island you can escape to islands without cars or cares, where\n        the local people smile \u201chello\u201d and, if you\u2019re lucky, point you to a\n        secret beach for the ultimate in quality leisure time. For ferry\n        information, call Tel. 2542 3081 or 2525 1108.\n        Lantau Island\n        The mountainous island of Lantau is the biggest in the\n        colony, and covers nearly twice the area of Hong Kong Island. Chek Lap\n        Kok airport sits on reclaimed land just off Lantau; plans to build a\n        bridge may change Lantau, but at present it is sparsely populated and\n        makes a perfect getaway.\n        At 934 m (3,064 ft), Lantau Peak is high enough to attract\n        the occasional rain cloud\u2002\u2014\u2002refreshingly cool breezes blow on most hot\n        summer days. More than half the island is parkland, and there is a\n        70-km (45-mile) circular hiking trail (see page 92). Ferries depart\n        from Central every two hours between 6:10am and 10:30pm to Silvermine\n        Bay (Mui Wo), where a bus terminal has buses to all parts of the\n        island. There are also ferries to Discovery Bay.\n        A short bus ride away is Cheung Sha Beach, 3 km (2 miles)\n        long, and popular for its white sand and excellent facilities.\n        The most famous site on the island is the world\u2019s tallest\n        seated bronze statue of Buddha at 22 m (72.6 ft), the Tiantan Buddha\n        (see page 55). The statue and a small museum are on a peak, up 268\n        steps, above Po Lin Monastery. The monastery is strictly vegetarian,\n        and visitors are warned not to bring any meat with them. You can have a\n        delicious vegetarian lunch here.\n        From the monastery, hikers enjoy the two-hour cross-country\n        trek down to Silvermine Bay, but the authorities have warned walkers to\n        be on the lookout for snakes, which can be plentiful in the Lantau\n        hinterland, especially in summer. The hillsides that surround the\n        monastery are the site of Hong Kong\u2019s only tea plantation. Visitors are\n        welcome to visit the 24-hectare (60-acre) establishment, and may sample\n        the end product, Lantau tea.\n        The island\u2019s largest community is Tai O. The people of this\n        picturesque village make their living by fishing, duck-breeding, and\n        food-processing. Many of the inhabitants live\u2002\u2014\u2002by choice, not\n        necessarily through economic hardship\u2002\u2014\u2002on the water, aboard houseboats\n        or in houses on stilts in the main creek.\n        A Trappist monastery, situated on a hillside overlooking\n        the east coast of Lantau, is also open to visitors. To get here, follow\n        the path from the southwest end of Discovery Bay; the walk takes about\n        30 minutes.\n        Cheung Chau\n        Some 10 km (6 miles) west of Hong Kong lies this small,\n        crowded island, only one square mile in size. More than 25,000 people\n        live here, mostly by fishing, but there are also ex-pats, attracted by\n        its laid-back Mediterranean ambience. The island has a checkered past\n        of smuggling and pira cy. That era is gone now, but other elements of\n        the island\u2019s old life are preserved. The people still carve jade and\n        build seaworthy junks, all by hand. Fish (heads discreetly wrapped in\n        paper) are still hung out to dry in the sun.\n        Cheung Chau becomes the center of Hong Kong life once a\n        year, usually in May, during the Bun Festival, a folklore extravaganza\n        (see page 89). The rest of the year, life goes on at its accustomed\n        pace: rickety machines chugging in two-man factories, children in\n        school uniforms being ferried home to houseboats, and the old fishermen\n        stirring shrimp paste.\n        By way of formal tourist attractions, Pak Tai Temple, built\n        in 1783, has some fine carvings and a great iron sword said to be 600\n        years old. But the most interesting thing to do here is to explore the\n        two villages on the island, Cheung Chau and San Wai. They are an easy\n        walk apart by the harbor road, or a longer 45-minute hike on the scenic\n        Peak Road. The Praya, the promenade in front of the ferry pier, is a\n        good place to observe the many junks and fishing boats in the harbor.\n        There are also several open-air restaurants where you can enjoy fresh\n        seafood.\n        Lamma Island\n        Only 35 minutes by ferry from Central, Lamma Island is\n        perfect for swimming, hiking, picnicking, birdwatching, or just sitting\n        back to watch the bananas grow. Hong Kong\u2019s third largest island has a\n        population of only about 12,000; it is still largely undeveloped, and\n        life on Lamma, if not totally primitive, is close to the essentials.\n        Archaeologists indicate that Lamma has probably been inhabited for some\n        4,000 years, and the island is known as \u201cHong Kong\u2019s Stone Age Island.\n        \u201d\n        The principal settlements are Yung Shue Wan on Lamma\u2019s\n        northwest, and Sok Kwu Wan, on the east coast. Both villages offer good\n        waterfront restaurants with homestyle Chinese food, principally seafood\n        fresh from the tank. The ports are within hiking distance of several\n        beautiful beaches, and within a one-hour hike of each other on a marked\n        trail. You can build an appetite for dinner by making your way from the\n        beach to the restaurant. Yung Shue Wan is still a very British\n        residential enclave, with many nice pubs.\n        An Excursion to Macau\n        Macau, the final bastion of Portugal\u2019s great 16th-century\n        empire, is much more than just a quirk of history. Here, where East and\n        West first met, life combines the spirit of Asia with something of the\n        sunny atmosphere of the Mediterranean.\n        Macau\u2019s historic center, with its colonial architecture,\n        has a distinctly Medit\u00ader\u00adranean flavor. Col\u00ad\u00ado\u00adn\u00adna\u00ad\u00added public\n        buildings, iron balconies, winding streets, flagstoned squares and the\n        many churches all speak of the Portuguese inheritance as well as the\n        Chinese, a fusion of East and West that has produced the unique\n        Macanese culture.\n        The story of the Western discovery of Macau begins in 1513\n        when Portuguese explorer, Jorge Alvares, reached the south coast of\n        China. Traders followed in his wake, setting up bases in several parts\n        of the Pearl River estuary. Finally, in 1557, they were all\n        consolidated in Macau. It was the only European gateway to China, and\n        through Macau flowed Western technology and religion. In 1576 Pope\n        Gregory XIII created the Macau diocese, covering all of China and\n        Japan.\n        No less impressive were the secular challenges. China and\n        Japan were not on speaking terms, so trade between them had to be\n        channeled through a neutral middleman. Lucky Macau fit the\n        specifications exactly. Portugal\u2019s resulting near-monopoly of East\u2013West\n        trade understandably awakened the competitive instincts of other\n        European powers. The Dutch sent an invasion flotilla to Macau in 1622,\n        but the defenders triumphed. However, the end of the golden age was\n        drawing near. China began to relax trade restrictions, and with the\n        rise of Hong Kong, Macau became an isolated Portuguese outpost.\n        A haven for persecuted Japanese Christians in the 17th\n        century, Portugal\u2019s neutrality during World War II assured the\n        territory a flood of refugees. They were joined by a swarm of spies of\n        all conceivable nationalities, and Macau won a name for international\n        intrigue.\n        Portugal\u2019s very precarious foothold on the Asian coast\n        ended in 1999 with a formal handover to China. Macau, now the Chinese\n        Special Economic Zone of Zhuhai, is becoming something like a boomtown\n        as an exporter of toys, furniture, and electronics. New construction in\n        the past 10 years has changed the city\u2019s skyline; with new, glittering\n        hotels and highrise apartment blocks, the city is beginning to look a\n        little more like Hong Kong.\n        Macau\u2019s population is estimated at around 450,000, an\n        appallingly high figure for such a small area; recent land reclamation\n        has eased the situation to some extent. If a trace of tropical lethargy\n        still adds to the charm in this city of sidewalk caf\u00e9s, palm trees, and\n        pedicabs, any torpor definitely ends once inside the doors of Macau\u2019s\n        casinos, scene of some of the liveliest gambling west of Las Vegas.\n        Gambling provides almost 40 percent of the government\u2019s tax revenues,\n        and is a major source of employment. Its spin-off industries,\n        prostitution and pawn shops, also thrive.\n        Arriving\n        The easiest way to get to Macau is by jetfoil, operated by\n        TurboJet (Tel. 2859-3333). The 40-mile trip takes about an hour.\n        Departures are from the Macau Ferry Terminal, just west of Central in\n        the Shun Tak Centre, 200 Connaught Road, Central, in Hong Kong.\n        Jetfoils leave every 15 to 30 minutes 24 hours a day.\n        Entry procedures are similar to those in Hong Kong\u2002\u2014\u2002most\n        nationalities need only a passport to enter Macau. Macau\u2019s own\n        currency, the pataca, is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar, and you can\n        use your Hong Kong currency freely in Macau.\n        Upon arrival in Macau, be sure to stop by the Macau\n        Government Tourist Office for a map, brochures, and directions. Outside\n        the terminal, you will find taxis as well as buses to all points (take\n        3, 3A, 10, or 10A to the historic center; exact change is required).\n        You\u2019ll also be approached by pedicab drivers; these are tricycles\n        carrying two passengers. Pedicabs were once the most common form of\n        transportation in Macau, but today they are mainly a tourist\n        attraction.\n        Sights in Macau\n        Directly across the street from the wharf where passengers\n        arrive from Hong Kong is the first surprise to greet visitors to\n        Macau\u2002\u2014\u2002the vast Jai-alai Palace, said to be the world\u2019s most luxurious\n        front\u00f3n. In an effort to provide yet one more thing to bet on, players\n        are imported from Spain to take part in this lightning-fast Basque ball\n        game.\n        The grandstand situated on the seaside road, the Avenida\n        da Amizade (Friendship Avenue), marks the finishing line for the Macau\n        Grand Prix, the international car-racing event held here every\n        November. Also in front of the ferry terminal is a new Cyber fountain,\n        with 86 water spouts that shoot up to 70 m (230 ft) and are illuminated\n        at night by 288 spotlights producing 80 colors.\n        Continuing around the peninsula in a clockwise direction\n        brings you to the Rua da Praia Grande (Big Beach Street)\u2002\u2014\u2002a pleasant\n        promenade with shaded benches under the banyan trees. Along this\n        elegant avenue is Government House, a modest pink palace.\n        The central square of the historic city center is Largo do\n        Senado. For an authentic feel of old Portugal, slip into the cool\n        entrance hall of theimpressive Leal Senado (\u201cLoyal Senate\u201d building), a\n        fine example of colonial architecture. On the inside walls are flowered\n        blue tiles (azulejos) and coats of arms. The inscription over the\n        archway reads, \u201cCidade do nome de Deus, n\u00e3o ha outra mais leal\u201d (\u201cCity\n        of the Name of God, None is More Loyal\u201d)\u2002\u2014\u2002a bit of praise attributed\n        to Portugal\u2019s King John IV in the 17th century. For all its historic\n        grandeur, the loyal Senate now is the equivalent of a city council, its\n        statesmanship dedicated to water supplies, sewage lines, and the\n        establishment of playgrounds.\n        Macau\u2019s most memorable monument is the Baroque fa\u00e7ade of\n        the ruins of S\u00e3o Paulo, the only remains of a beautiful 17th-century\n        Jesuit church. On top of a hill in the center of the city, it\u2019s\n        approached by a grand staircase. The rest of the building and an\n        adjoining college were destroyed in a typhoon-fanned fire in 1835. The\n        rich sculptural effects on the fa\u00e7ade mix Eastern and Western symbols:\n        familiar saints, Chinese dragons, and a Portuguese caravel. Beneath the\n        church, the Museum of Sacred Art houses a collection of sacramental\n        objects.\n        The ambitious Museum of Macau (open Tuesday\u2013Sunday\n        10am\u20136pm; admission HK$15) opened in 1998 in the lower levels of the\n        Monte Fortress. Entrance is by escalator, near St. Paul\u2019s. It gives an\n        overview of Macau\u2019s history and its daily life and traditions. A\n        re-created street of colonial Macau is lined with traditional Chinese\n        shops. The fort, built by the Jesuits in the 17th century as a defense\n        against the Dutch, was largely destroyed by the same fire that burned\n        St. Paul\u2019s.\n        Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es (1524\u20131580), the Portuguese national\n        poet whose work immortalized that country\u2019s golden age of discoveries,\n        may have stayed in Macau. Local legend claims that he wrote part of his\n        great saga, Os Lus\u00edadas, in what is now called the Cam\u00f5es Grotto,\n        situated in the spacious tropical Cam\u00f5es Garden.\n        Next to the museum, behind a gate (opened to anyone who\n        knocks), is the Old Protestant Cemetery. Those whose fate was to die on\n        some far foreign field could not have wanted a more peaceful, lovely\n        graveyard. The small, whitewashed chapelwas the first Protestant church\n        built in China.\n        For a different vision of Old China, spend a few quiet\n        moments in the classic Lou Lim Ieoc Garden. Here, arched bridges,\n        pagodas, fish ponds, and stands of bamboo create the mood of a timeless\n        Chinese painting. Nearby is the Memorial House of Dr. Sun Yat-sen,\n        founder of the Chinese Republic. Photos and documents tell the life\n        story of the physician-revolutionary-statesman, who lived for a time in\n        Macau, but never in this building.\n        Kun Iam Tong, off Avenida do Coronel Mesquita (open daily\n        8am\u20136pm), is a 17th-century Buddhist temple of considerable splendor\n        and charm. Surrounded by statues, carvings, and incense burners, here\n        the faithful make their devotions and check their fortunes, and\n        traditional funerary displays give a cheerful send-off to the recently\n        departed.\n        An unexpected piece of historical memorabilia turns up in\n        the monastery garden, where guides point out a small stone table used\n        for a treaty-signing ceremony in 1844. The signatories, who were the\n        Chinese viceroy from Canton and the minister plenipotentiary of the\n        United States of America, put their names to a historic document\u2002\u2014\u2002the\n        first-ever treaty between the two countries.\n        Another important ceremony took place in 1999 when Macau\n        became part of China. The Handover Pavilion was meant to be a temporary\n        structure, but public outcry ensured its preservation (located on Xian\n        Xing Hai; open weekdays 10am\u20136pm, until 10pm weekends). Nearby is the\n        Macau Cultural Center and the Museum of Art (open Tuesday\u2013Sunday\n        10am\u20137pm; closed Monday; small admission). \u00ad\n        Macau\u2019s oldest museum, the Maritime Museum\n        (Wednesday\u2013Monday 10am\u20135:30pm; admission HK$10, HK$5 children over 10)\n        traces the history of Macau\u2019s connection to the sea. Exhibits cover\n        fishing, seaborne trade, sea transport, and there is an aquarium. The\n        museum also offers boat tours aboard a fishing junk.\n        The museum is almost on the spot where the Portuguese\n        first landed. When they came ashore they found the A-Ma Temple\n        (properly called Ma Kok Temple; open daily dawn to dusk), dedicated to\n        the favorite goddess of fishermen, who is also known as Tin Hau. The\n        area was called A-Ma Gau (\u201cBay of A-Ma\u201d), and in this way, Macau got\n        its name. The ornate, picturesque temple dates from the Ming Dynasty\n        (1368\u20131644) and is the oldest building in Macau.\n        The remains of the 17th-century Barra Fortress, which once\n        defended the southern tip of the peninsula, contains the chapel of\n        Santiago (St. James). The saint is much revered in the surrounding\n        area. Among other legends surrounding the statue is a very modern one:\n        During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, when Red Guards were running\n        rampant on Wanchai island, just a swim away, the image of St. James is\n        said to have stepped down from the altar and halted an invasion. Part\n        of the fortress has been converted and is now used as a luxury inn. The\n        northernmost point in Macau is the frontier between two contrasting\n        worlds. The Barrier Gate (Portas do Cerco), which was built more than a\n        century ago, marks the boundary between the enclave of Macau and the\n        People\u2019s Republic of China.\n        Trying Your Luck\n        Macau\u2019s casinos are a source of non-stop excitement. There\n        are 12 of them; you can\u2019t miss the eye-popping Lisboa, which has\n        several floors of gambling, but there\u2019s also the Hyatt Regency, the\n        Mandarian Oriental, and Taipa\u2019s Jockey Club. The fancifully decorated\n        Macau Palace, a floating casino moored on the western waterfront, is\n        fitted out with gambling tables, slot machines (known locally as\n        \u201chungry tigers\u201d) and, for hungry humans, a restaurant. Gambling is\n        wildly popular with the Chinese of Hong Kong, and they make up nearly\n        80 percent of all visitors to the casinos.\n        The casinos offer familiar international games\u2002\u2014\u2002baccarat,\n        blackjack, boule, craps, roulette\u2002\u2014\u2002along with more exotic Chinese\n        pastimes. Watch the fantan dealer for a few minutes and you\u2019ll almost\n        be an expert: It\u2019s simply a matter of how many odd buttons are left\n        after he has divided a pile of them into groups of four.\n        Dai-Siu (Big and Small) is a dice game in which the\n        croupier throws three dice inside a glass container. Players bet on the\n        numbers that will come up, and on whether the result will be \u201cbig\u201d or\n        \u201csmall. \u201d Keno is a variation of bingo in which the player chooses\n        numbers to bet on before the draw is made.\n        The casinos have no admission charge and formal dress is\n        optional, though long pants for men are required. They keep busy 24\n        hours a day, but if you want a change of scene there are always more\n        gambling opportunities available. You can try your luck at pari mutuel\n        betting on jai-alai at pari mutuel, greyhound-racing at the Cani\u00addrome\n        (one of the largest in the world), and harness-racing on Taipa.\n        Shopping in Macau\n        Like Hong Kong, Macau is a duty-free port. It is famous\n        for its gold jewelry. Market prices per tael (34 grams/1.2 ounces) of\n        gold are set daily. You should always ask for a certificate of\n        guarantee when you buy gold or jewelry. Look for jewelry shops along\n        Avenida do Infante D. Henrique and Avenida de Almei\u00adda Ribeiro.\n        Browsing is a real pleasure in Macau\u2019s main streets and\n        byways, where shops aimed at the tourist market are interspersed with\n        the more workaday ironmongers, herbalists, and noodle stalls.\n        Knowle\u00addgeable visitors look for antiques\u2002\u2014\u2002either Chinese heirlooms or\n        leftovers from the gracious Portuguese colonial days. However, you are\n        not likely to find bargains, and you should be aware that unless you\n        are an expert, you can end up with a fake. Also worth investigating are\n        contemporary handicrafts, both Portuguese and Chinese, from across the\n        border.\n        Food and Drink\n        Gourmets award Macau high marks for dependable Chinese\n        cooking with an exotic bonus: Portuguese food and wines. Macau\u2019s own\n        cuisine is a combination of Chinese flavors with the flavors imported\n        from Portugal, Brazil, and Africa. Whether you choose to dine in one of\n        the Macanese, Chinese, traditional Portuguese, or international-style\n        restaurants, you will be treated to a hearty meal at a good price.\n        The ingredients, especially the fresh fish and seafood,\n        are first-rate. A delicate, delicious fish is Macau sole (linguado).\n        Imported dried cod (bacalhao) is the Portuguese national dish; several\n        varieties are available, usually baked.\n        Macau has an ample supply of Portuguese wines. Try a vinho\n        verde, a mildly sparkling young wine from northern Portugal, or a\n        hearty red D\u00e3o or Colares. After dinner, a glass of Madeira or port is\n        recommended to round off the meal. The more abstemious can stick to\n        Portuguese mineral water.\n        Taipa and Coloane\n        Bridges link Macau with its two islands. Since the\n        construction of the New Macau-Taipa Bridge has allowed easy access to\n        the airport, the population has grown to more than 30,000, with\n        industrial development, new apartment blocks, and luxury resort\n        hotels.\n        The quaint Taipa Village, with its narrow lanes and\n        colonial buildings painted yellow, blue, and green, has almost been\n        completely swallowed up by the development of nearby housing projects.\n        The island is also the designated home of the University of East Asia.\n        Pay a visit to the Casa Museu da Taipa, and you\u2019ll be able to get a\n        glimpse of how Macanese families lived in former days. A grand colonial\n        house, fully restored and outfitted with period furnishings, provides\n        the centerpiece for this expanding \u201ccultural village. \u201d\n        Farther away is Coloane, connected to Taipa by a causeway\n        and a large land reclamation project. Not as developed as Taipa, it\n        offers the joys of sand and sea and is known for its beaches. Cheoc Van\n        and Hac Sa (\u201cBlack Sands\u201d) are both popular resort areas, with\n        lifeguards on duty in summer and windsurfing boards for rent. There are\n        restaurants, swimming pools, and changing facilities. The village of\n        Coloane is picturesque, with a central square lined with caf\u00e9s. The\n        waterfront drive parallels the shore of a Chinese island, and boats\n        headed to China pass through the narrow waterway. The small Chapel of\n        St. Francis Xavier is dedicated to the 16th-century patron saint of\n        missionaries, and has on display the elbow of the saint, along with the\n        bones of numerous Japanese and Vietnamese martyrs.\n        Seac Pai Van Park, on the west coast of the island is an\n        interesting natural preserve with aNatural History Museum.\n        An Excursion to Guangzhou (Canton)\n        Guangzhou was China\u2019s major seaport for 2,000 years and\n        the center for European traders in the 19th century. The city still\n        maintains its important gateway role. Ever since 1957 the Canton Trade\n        Fair (officially the Chinese Export Commodities Fair) has attracted\n        throngs of international business people every spring and autumn.\n        Guangzhou, with a population of more than 5 million,\n        straddles the Pearl River\u2002\u2014\u2002China\u2019s fifth longest\u2002\u2014\u2002which links the\n        city to the South China Sea. This waterway accounts for much of the\n        local charm and excitement, as the daily drama of the ferryboats,\n        junks, sampans, freighters\u2002\u2014\u2002and even small tankers and big\n        gunboats\u2002\u2014\u2002unfolds right in the center of town. The river also\n        irrigates the carefully tended surrounding farmlands, creating a\n        beautifully lush, subtropical scene. Guangdong Province has some of\n        China\u2019s most fertile land, and grows two crops of rice a year, along\n        with vegetables of all kinds.\n        Guangzhou today is mostly about business and industry,\n        featuring new development, skyscrapers, a whole new business area, and\n        raised expressways. The scary traffic is a real experience\u2002\u2014\u2002vehicles\n        of all kinds jockey for position on crowded streets, missing each other\n        by inches, and speeding on the freeways is rampant. Guangzhou is\n        interestingly one of China\u2019s most prosperous cities, determinedly on\n        the move into the modern world. It seems that the picturesque older\n        sections with their old houses, narrow streets, and winding alleyways\n        may not be around much longer.\n        Arriving in Guangzhou\n        There are many package tours to Guangzhou from Hong Kong\n        (see page 113), and this may be the easiest way to visit the city.\n        However, it\u2019s also easy to get to Guangzhou by train or ferry. Four\n        comfortable express trains depart the Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR)\n        Station in Hung Hom, Kowloon, making the trip in less than two hours.\n        Turbo Cat ferries leave the China Hong Kong City (CHKC) terminal twice\n        a day; the journey takes two hours. Citibus also travels to Guangzhou\n        from CHKC; there are five round-trips a day, taking 31/2 hours.\n        You will need a visa to enter China (see page 109 for\n        information). Hong Kong currency is widely accepted in Guangzhou, or\n        you can change your currency into RMB (yuan) at any bank or hotel.\n        Note, however, that the exchange does not go the other way (see page\n        116).\n        Guangzhou, like Hong Kong, is primarily\n        Cantonese-speaking, but many people also speak Mandarin. English is\n        spoken in hotels and tourist destinations.\n        If you travel by train, you will arrive at the Guangzhou\n        East Station, a large modern complex, which connects with the subway,\n        buses, hotel transfer services, and taxis. The train station is in the\n        newer business district; nearby is Asia\u2019s third-tallest building, at 83\n        stories, which will often be pointed out to you.\n        Sights in Guangzhou\n        Yuexiu Park, situated near the Trade Fair in the northern\n        part of the city, is Guangzhou\u2019s largest; it covers a hilly 100\n        hectares (247 acres). The park is landscaped with lakes and gardens. In\n        the park is the 1380 Zhenhai Tower, one of the city\u2019s oldest buildings.\n        Actually a five-story pavilion on a hilltop, it contains a fine\n        collection of historical exhibits. Dr. Sun Yat-sen\u2019s Memorial Hall\n        honors the founder of the Chinese Revolution, flanked by his heroic\n        statue in copper. Dr. Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925) began his political\n        career in Canton. This enormous, modern version of a traditional\n        Chinese building, with sweeping blue tile roofs, contains an auditorium\n        big enough to seat 4,700 people. It was built in 1931 with\n        contributions from overseas Chinese. The center of the park is the Five\n        Rams Statue. It celebrates the founding of Guangzhou, when five spirits\n        rode their goats down from the celestial realm to present the\n        inhabitants of the city with their very first grains of rice.\n        Guangzhou\u2019s most important Buddhist monument is the\n        1,400-year-old Temple of the Six Banyan Trees (open 8am\u20135pm). Although\n        the banyan trees that once flourished here are now no more, the\n        often-restored complex has remained a focus of local Buddhist\n        activities. Golden Buddha statues in several of Buddha\u2019s aspects adorn\n        the temples, and overlooking them is the 17-story Flower Pagoda, a\n        slender relic of the Song dynasty (a.d. 960\u20131279).\n        In the early Middle Ages, Canton had a significant Muslim\n        population as a result of its trade with the Middle East. This explains\n        the presence in Guangzhou of the Huaisheng Mosque, reputed to be\n        China\u2019s oldest, and traditionally dated a.d. 627. Rebuilt in modern\n        times, the mosque serves the small local community of Muslims. The\n        modern minaret is known as the \u201cPlain (or Naked) Pagoda,\u201d in contrast\n        to the Flower Pagoda of the Buddhist temple.\n        Chen Jia Ci, the Chen Family Institute (open daily\n        8:30am\u20135pm), was built in the late 19th century to promote arts and\n        crafts. An architectural wonder, it is itself a beautiful piece of\n        craftsmanship with its sculpture and carved stone balustrades.\n        Porcelain friezes adorn the rooftops and ridgepoles, telling the story\n        of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Inside is a collection of\n        ceramics, carvings, and furniture. There is also a market and a\n        porcelain shop.\n        A former Confucian temple is presently the home of the\n        historic National Peasant Movement Institute, where the Chinese\n        Communist Party trained its leaders in the 1920s. Mao Zedong himself\n        directed the institute in 1926, and gave lectures on geography, rural\n        education, and \u201cThe Problem of the Chinese Peasantry. \u201d Zhou Enlai also\n        taught here.\n        The atmosphere of 19th-century Canton is best evoked on\n        Shamian Island, a haunting, nostalgic place in the Pearl River. This\n        small formerly residential island, beautifully shaded by banyan trees,\n        was the home of the closed community of the foreign colony in the era\n        of \u201cconcessions. \u201d The bridges were barred by night with iron gates to\n        keep the Chinese out. Its stately European-style buildings have since\n        been restored, largely for use as government offices and foreign\n        legations. The island also has Guangzhou\u2019s first modern luxury resort\n        hotel.\n        A popular optional excursion is an hour\u2019s detour to\n        Guangzhou Zoo, founded in 1958. It houses more than 200 animal species,\n        most famous of which is the giant panda, and has an imaginative monkey\n        mountain behind a moat.\n        Not to be missed is a visit to Guangzhou\u2019s famous open-air\n        market, Qing Ping. Guangzhou is famous for its food. The Cantonese love\n        to eat and have the reputation of eating almost anything that walks on\n        four legs. The market bears this out: Along with the usual ducks and\n        chickens, you will see for sale snakes, dogs, bats, and sometimes\n        monkeys\u2002\u2014\u2002all are highly prized as delicacies. More pleasantly, you can\n        browse among lanes of antiques, flowers, herbs, fruit, goldfish,\n        songbirds, and more.\n        A Side Trip to Foshan\n        A very popular day-trip from Guangzhou goes to Foshan, a\n        city of nearly 300,000 people, renowned for its handicrafts for more\n        than a thousand years. The individual artisans\u2019 shops are no longer\n        here, but you can visit a silk-weaving factory, a ceramics plant, and\n        the Foshan Folk Art Studio, where you can observe workers making\n        Chinese lanterns, carving sculptures, painting scrolls, and cutting\n        intricate designs in paper. The Foshan Art Porcelain Factory has\n        traditional designs, but also some attractive modern pieces.\n        Foshan\u2019s most outstanding artistic monument is Zu Miao,\n        the Taoist Ancestral Temple, a Sung dynasty establishment rebuilt in\n        the 14th century and well worth visiting. Constructed in wood, brick,\n        stone, ceramic, and bronze, this is a work of extravagant beauty,\n        uniting many ancient art forms. The complex contains the oldest wooden\n        stage in China, used by the Wan Fu Tai Chinese opera.\n        An Excursion to Shenzhen\n        Shenzhen was China\u2019s first Special Economic Zone.\n        Literally created out of rural farmland, it was set up in the 1970s as\n        the answer to Hong Kong. From a population of 20,000 it has grown into\n        a metropolis of 2.5 million, with tightly clustered skyscrapers and\n        some of China\u2019s highest grossing industries.\n        Because Shenzhen is much cheaper than Hong Kong, it is a\n        popular weekend destination for Hong Kong\u2019s Chinese, who come to relax,\n        dine in its resorts, and play golf\u2002\u2014\u2002Shenzhen hosted the World Cup of\n        Golf in 1995. It is even becoming something of a commuter town\u2002\u2014\u2002owning\n        or renting an apartment here costs a fraction of what it would in Hong\n        Kong.\n        Shenzhen is easy to reach\u2002\u2014\u2002the KCR commuter train runs\n        throughout the day, the trip taking about 40 minutes. Visitors need a\n        visa to enter China, and must disembark at the border (now called\n        \u201cboundary\u201d) checkpoint, Lo Wai. City buses also go to Shenzhen. A Turbo\n        Cat ferry makes a one-hour trip (7am\u20137pm) from Hong Kong\u2019s Macau Ferry\n        Terminal to Shekou on the Natau Peninsula, which is part of the\n        economic zone.\n        Shenzhen is a premier shopping center, and much cheaper\n        than Hong Kong. It is known for its inexpensive (but well-made)\n        knock-off designer goods. You can use your Hong Kong dollars here, so\n        there\u2019s no need to change currency.
