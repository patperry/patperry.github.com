{"title": "Algebraic Systems", "text": "   As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science\nstudying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular\nsystem of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming\nmajority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic\nstructures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first\ngeneral theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary\noperations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.\nTarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic\nprinciples of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such\nsets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made\nabundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of\nmaking fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but\nalso the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was\ndiscovered by the author in 1936.\n  During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the\ntheory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately\nrelated despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And\nit is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems\ndealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and\nrelations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the\nlanguage of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can\nbe considered to border on logic and algebra.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.000025"}

In this paper the concept is\ngeneralized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect\nwere to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be\ninfluenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.\nTo test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of\nsimilar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations\npapers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of\npapers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.\nWe then see whether there were any differences in the reception of\nthese papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's\nlocation in the stratification system.  All the data indicate\nthat assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important \ndeterminant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification\nvariables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality\nis influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work\nthat is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.

{"title": "Productivity Differences among Scientists:", "text": "  Evidence for Accumulative Advantage\n   The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be \npartly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback\nthrough recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or\nincrease their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce\neven less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the\ndistribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of\nscientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for\nchemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in\ninequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with \na changing distribution of time spent on research..

There seemed\nto be no practicable way to measure the quality of large\nnumbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers of\nscientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index\n(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool\nto measure the significance of individual scientists'\ncontributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all\nbibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large\nnumber of journals.

{"title": "Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology", "text": "  The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and\nservices are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review\nchapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,\nbegan gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment\nof many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts\nto use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\"\nThese movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being\ncost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only\npromises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new\nproblems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions\nrequires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance\nto a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user\nsubgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning\nand design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\"\nissue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and\nconsiderations.\n  One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth\nin the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated\nby the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The\napparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same\nproblems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among\nlibrary and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed\nmaterials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less\nrapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,\nserials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The\ninclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -\nreflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the\nownership and distribution of information.

Indeed, one of the reasons for the\nAnnual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is to\nhelp its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving\ntechniques they are fostering.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.000140"}

Libraries have assumed the active role of\nserving the informational, educational and recreational needs\nof the population.  The size of that population grows constantly,\nits educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of\nleisure time is increasing.\n  The application of computer technology to libraries,\nespecially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in\nthe performance of library functions, is a complex process\nand demands the highest level of talent of both the library\nand computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be\naccomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design\nof a library system is a team effort between librarians,\ncomputer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a\nlimited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to\nfit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest\nproject will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For\nthese reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at\nleast a general overview of what library automation is all\nabout.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.000141"}

The ancient archives\ncontained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations\ngrew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a\ncountry's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and\nlibraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to\nsucceeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this\nway, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass\nthis memory on to living individuals.

ASCA in its original form\nwas based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of\nreferences to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers\nciting this work.

Social scientists, faced with a much \nsmaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and\nless inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries\nin the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with\nsocial scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in \nscientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally,\nuntil OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this\nkind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its\ndisadvantages and advantages.

He\nurges that men of science should then turn to the massive task\nof making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.\nFor years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than\nthe powers of his mind.

The central theme of the work is a relatively new\nconcept - the rise of an \"anthropological\" species we call the\nauthoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older style\nhe seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly \nindustrialized society with irrational or anti-rational \nbeliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud\nto be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others,\njealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power\nand authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting\ntrends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and\npolitical thinkers.

Although the neglect of theory is\nscarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact\nthat American radicals are often more American than they know and\nmay prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the\nintangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical\nproblems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals\nhave with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose more\nexpressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture\ndispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" of\nintellectual confrontation.

To take but one \nfield, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers\nto be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million\nto be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one\nmillion papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and\nbefore 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal\nto the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be\npublished and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began\npublication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum\nLibrary was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a\nfurther 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology\n(N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use\nof scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930\nthe number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the\nN.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science\nMuseum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of\nall the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period\nwhich itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for\npeaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic\nmaterials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).\nThere are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples\nmay not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at\na very high level indeed.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.000371"}

To date, most of the statements\nof requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion\nrather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been\nobtained.

The techniques of detailed depth\nclassification have been greatly developed during the past decade,\nand instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the\ntraditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.\nThese developments have been reported mainly as research papers\nin a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily\ndifficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.\nThere is a need for a more simply written and more readily\navailable practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of\nclassification.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.000388"}

{"title": "Cost-Effectiveness as a Guide in Developing Indexing Rules", "text": "   To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the \ncourse of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, \nbeen guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some \nobjective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type \ncriteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the \nstate-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate \nfor operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that \ntakes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of \noperating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing \npossible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of \neffectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, \nmachine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of \ncriterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach\nis described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of \neffectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to\nreduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of \ndefining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete \nsteps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and \nsmall-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.000500"}

In terms of this\nframework, the former have concentrated on automating\nthe operations of the component for content analysis\nand representation, while the latter have emphasized\nthe data management component.  The complementary\nnature of these developments allows the\npostulation of an integrated approach to automated\nlanguage processing.

The third refinement of this system,\nRegistry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major\nchanges in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques\nfor registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms \nand bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately \nidentified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each\nsubstance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclature\nderivation and also a computer-based structure output system.

In this way, an approximate \nrepresentation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as \ncomplementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast\nintensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc..\n   Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, \ne.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated\nby an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, \ne.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is \nmore  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components \nof its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge \nrequires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its \noperand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it\nfalls into category I or II..\n   The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for \nseveral relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly,\netc..

However, it was one of the propositions arising from\nCranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked.\nIn reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the\nsimple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test results\ncoming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made\nfurther modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward\nto read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of\nsubsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected\ndecreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question,\nthere is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results\nof a number of different searches are averaged.

Numerous\nstudies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish\nobsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.

The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which\nfunction most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those\nwhich are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment\nand uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by \nnonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using \nthe Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the \nusual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the \nstatistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \n\"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few\ndocuments are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more\neffective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents\nare wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for \nthe quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never \nimproves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A\ncorollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same\naverage breadth where one indexing consists of\nsemantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the\nother consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms..

Other divisions would\nbe concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers or\nofficial documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largely\nautonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing..

Even\nthough persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided\nto enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though\nsome recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient\nto account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the\ncompetitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecular\nbiology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position,\nadduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergence\nof experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and\nphilosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities which\noccur in scientific development.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.001063"}

Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at \none time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their \nparticular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of\nits future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance to \nscientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their\nown right.\n  Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread \nwithin a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can \ntherefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set of \nmathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of \nscientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to \nestablish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area \nof scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines\nof investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the \ngiven area.\n  The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it\nto the development of knowledge about mast cells.

{"title": "Library Optimum", "text": "Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical\nframework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He is\ncareful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, \nin case the value of the aging factor a or the\ncontents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet very \nlittle experimental evidence on the consistency\nof either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor \nis reasonably constant.  But the position of\nthe Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M.\nWeingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in \nthe Journal of Ecology three or more times in\n1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in \nthe two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in\nboth.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, \nonly eight (25%) attained that level in both, and\ntwelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank \ncorrelation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant.\n  There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data\nanalyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid\nparameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no\nmention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the \nearlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which \nanalyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in \nterms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger have\ndiscussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations \nto that article.  Their work implies a more complex\nrelation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of\ncitations for forecasting library consultations\nremains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not\nnecessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often \nintended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again,\neach citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of \nwhich he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there any\ninherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between \nthe list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.001090"}

And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly\nexpressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed\nutilization of existing manpower.\n  It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then\npresident of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee\non Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments\nand to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing\nprofessional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a few\nlibraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers\nthat they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that a\nneed was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could\nbe more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might\nhave national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be\nsought.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.001206"}

Twenty years later, with chain\nprocedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered\na new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first\nissues of 1971.\n  To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider\nthese indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling\nbibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Two\nforces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject\nindexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; \nsecondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange\nnetworks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example.\n  In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of\nsubject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be\ndominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified\nby the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabetical\nfile.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good deal\nof Cutter's \"Rules for a dictionary catalog\" is devoted to the problem of \nidentifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting\nit as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion of\nnatural language, and the production of inverted headings.

It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an \ninordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of \nantecedent papers.

The citation index makes this check practicable.  \nEven if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing \nthe citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort\nrequired to compile it.\n  This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a \nnew approach to subject control of the literature of science.

{"title": "Science and Information Theory", "text": "  A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory\nof information.  It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has\nexpanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a very\npractical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is it\npossible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or \ntelegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of information\ncommunicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare these\ntwo qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of these\nproblems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication\nengineer and can now be discussed quantitatively.\n  From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical\nand practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations.\nOnce stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific\ndiscussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to\nshow a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The \nthermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain\nphysical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory,\nit is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle\nstates that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than\nthe amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negative\nentropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  The\ngeneralized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of\ninformation.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments\nand is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.001309"}

This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one of\npsychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: Jean\nPiaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he\nis hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades been\ndeveloping a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of the\ndevelopment of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhn\nacknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits a\nsequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.001311"}

This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to\ninvestigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are\nresponsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible\nsteps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a\ndestructive utilization of science.\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.001330"}

{"title": "Least Cost Decision Rules for the Selection of Library Materials for", "text": "Compact Storage\n   For the last several decades library collections have been growing at\nexponential rates with no relief evident in the future..\n   To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections,\nmany librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for\nlittle-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage\nsystem are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the \ncriteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study\ndemonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage \nquantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the\nsmall shelving costs associated with stored materials..\n   Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the\nother utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared..\nFor the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical\nage at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the \nfraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the\ncirculation rate of the books decline with age according to an average \ngeometric pattern of obsolescence..\n   The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is\nutilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision\nvariable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage \nrate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that\na book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being \nused.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which \nthe time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, \nalthough the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite \ndistribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon \nthe circulation activities of the individual libraries..\n   An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected\nfrom three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters\nextracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules\nand the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from\nstorage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the\ncollection must be stored..\n   Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the\nlatter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation \nwhere the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit \nrelocation cost..\n   Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values\nshow that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively \ninsignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the \ncapacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; \nand that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost\ndifferential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather\nsubjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a\npotentially large influence on the decision rules..\n", "collection": "CISI", "id": "cisi.001417"}
{"title": "Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library", "text": "Systems\n   Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research..\nLibraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major\nresponsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most\nuniversities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized\nlibraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This\nuse of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally,\nresulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. \nThe purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this \ndivision of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to \nexamine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the \nscattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. \nThese results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library \nsystems..\n   Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually\nestimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are\ndeveloped.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its\nadvantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made\nrelative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can\nbe defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can\nserve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines..\nThis framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and\nalso for measuring the similarity between two disciplines..\n   One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study\nof journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title\ndispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has \nresulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford\ndistribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various\nsources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the\nYule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered..\n   The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and \nevaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in \ndetermining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding\nadditional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and\nbuilding mathematical models of library systems are among some of the\napplications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity\nfunctions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as\na function of the number of subscriptions it receives..\n   The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which\nthe above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was \ncollected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. \ndissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete\nrecords of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained..\nThe Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally\nsatisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific\ndisciplines is measured as is the similarity\nbetween the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also\nmeasured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's\nholdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed \nand evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions..\n   This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts\nas title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between \ndisciplines, and others..

(2) there always\nexists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a\nsimilar result was obtained by synge from energy\nconsiderations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the\nmotion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the\nasymptotic behavior of the curves shows further\nthat there always exists a maximum value of a beyond\nwhich the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence\nthe qualitative shape of the curve is determined .\n  the author proceeds to show that simple approximate\nexpressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his\ngeneral analysis for a given velocity profile .  these\napproximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius\nflow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds\nnumbers are based on the width of the channel and the\ndisplacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method\nfor computing the complete instability curve is presented\nand the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked\nout in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been\ngiven before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more\nexact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far\nas the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned .\nthe value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for\npoiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the\nminimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the\nagreement with the estimate from the simple criterion\nmentioned above is thus very good .\n  a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous\neffects and of future developments concludes the paper .\n", "collection": "CRAN", "id": "cran.000417"}

(d) from observations\nof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obvious\nchromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctional\nchanges were observed in\nstrains infected naturally or experimentally.\n(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derived\ncell strains there was a marked elevation\nin frequency of chromosome breakage in\n3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlation\nbetween virus shedding in vitro and\nincreased chromosome breakage was noted\nalthough this was not complete.  (g) the\ncombined average frequency of chromosome\nbreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortion\nstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortus\nstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,\nbut significant elevation in average chromosome\nbreak frequency (9.8%) was obtained\nin four cell strains which had been experimentally\ninfected in vitro with rubella virus\n(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effects\nupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,\nthese were restricted to slight general elevations\nin frequency of breakage above\nnormal values.  very high increases in breaks\nwere sporadic.  it appears more likely\nthat the general fetal abnormalities associated\nwith rubella infection in vivo result\nfrom possible effects of the virus upon growth\nrather than from effects upon the\nchromosomes.  however, the studies were\nrestricted to fibroblasts cultured in\nvitro; and effects on other types of cells\nmay have greater implications for this\nquestion.\n", "collection": "MED", "id": "med.000905"}
